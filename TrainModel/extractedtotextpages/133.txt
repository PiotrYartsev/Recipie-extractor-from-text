SERVES 8 TO 10 AS P ART OF AN ANTIP ASTO SPREAD
I often serve this dish as part of a
spread of salads and vegetable
dishes, all laid out on pretty
platters, which is my favorite
formula for summer entertaining.
Sometimes I include a meat dish,
such as sliced grilled pork
tenderloin, but usually the meal
feels festive and complete
without it, as long as there is a
good variety of vegetables and a
grain or bean dish or two . I ﬁnd
that eggplant is “meaty” tasting,
so it’s a key part of the balance.
You can use smaller Japanese eggplants and split them
lengthwise, but I like the nice round medallions that you
get from an Italian or globe eggplant. I avoid super-bulbous
ones, however , because they usually conceal lots of seeds.
If you want to salt your slices, do so, though I don’t see a
huge beneﬁt to that extra step. Most fresh eggplants are
not that bitter . Use any good-quality feta cheese; I like
Valbreso brand, which is made from sheep’s milk in France.
