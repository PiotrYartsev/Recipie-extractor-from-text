LIGHT TURKEY BROTH
MAKES ABOUT 4 QT/3.8 L
3 lb/1.4 kg turk ey necks
1 celery stalk
1/2 yellow onion
5 qt/4.7 L water
Kosher salt (optional)
In a large pot, combine the turkey necks, celery , onion, and
water and bring to a boil over high heat. Immediately turn
down the heat to a bare simmer and cook, uncovered, for
21/2 to 3 1/2 hours. During the ﬁrst hour or so, you will
notice foamy scum forming on the surface. Use a large
spoon to skim it oﬀ . If you want to retrieve the turkey meat
while it still has some ﬂavor , use tongs to pull out the necks
after about 2 hours, pick oﬀ the meat, and return the bones
to the pot to ﬁnish simmering. The broth is ready when it
has a good rich ﬂavor .
Remove the pot from the heat. P our or ladle the broth
through a ﬁne-mesh sieve placed over a clean container .
You should have about 4 qt/3.8 L broth, which is a good
intensity for an all-purpose broth. If you want to season the
broth with salt, stir it in now . Let cool, skim oﬀ any visible
fat, and transfer to storage containers. Cover and
refrigerate for 1 week or freeze for up to 4 months.
