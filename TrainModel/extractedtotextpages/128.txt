wear rubber gloves. Be sure to wash your hands thoroughly
with soap and water when you have ﬁnished.
Place a large frying pan over medium-high heat, add the
chiles, and toast them by pressing them ﬂat onto the hot
surface with a metal spatula. Once they change color and
you can start to smell them, they are ready . Don’t toast
them too long or they’ll scorch. Transfer the chiles to a
medium bowl, add hot water to cover , and let soak until
quite soft, at least 30 minutes.
While the chiles are soaking, in a medium frying pan, heat
the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion, season with
1/4 tsp salt, and cook, stirring frequently , until the onion
starts to sizzle. Then reduce the heat to low and continue to
cook until the onion is very soft and sweet and is starting to
caramelize, about 15 minutes. Add the garlic, cumin, and
sugar and cook for another 30 seconds or so . Remove from
the heat and set aside until the chiles are ready .
Drain the chiles, reserving the soaking water . In a blender ,
combine the chiles and the onion mixture and process until
puréed, adding enough of the broth to create a smooth
purée and stopping to scrape down the sides of the blender .
Now add the remaining broth and process, adding a little of
the soaking water if needed to get a nice pouring
consistency reminiscent of very thick canned tomato juice.
Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt or sugar if
needed.
