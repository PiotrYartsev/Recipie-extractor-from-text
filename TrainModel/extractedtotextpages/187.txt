the sauce is reduced, those ﬂavors get strong and
unpleasant and you can actually feel the tannins on your
tongue. My basic white wine for cooking is an unoaked
Sauvignon Blanc, though not a super-grapefruity one such
as those from the Marlborough region of New Zealand. F or
a red, I like a Syrah from southern France. Whatever wine
you use, be sure to reduce it thoroughly . Splashing some
wine into a sauce may feel joie de vivre-ish, but you’ll only
give your sauce an unwelcome je ne sais quoi of raw
alcohol and acid.
The ultra cream sauce is also mostly trouble free, though if
you overreduce the cream, the water can get out of whack
with the butterfat and your sauce can separate. If you see
that happening—the ﬁrst sign is little beads of butterfat
appearing around the edges of the pan —just whisk in a
few drops of water or broth and perhaps a touch of fresh
cream.
HOW MUCH SAUCE PER SERVING?
I can’t tell you an average amount of béchamel or velouté,
since those will most likely be components of any number
of other recipes. An average serving of lighter cream sauce
might be cup/80 milliliters per person. The richest sauces
are best in modest portions of 1/4 cup/60 milliliters.
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT
My preferred pan is a heavy , stainless steel–lined copper
Windsor pan, which has sloped sides. (The same pan I
describe on page 92 for making butter sauces.) The copper
doesn’t really matter , other than for emotional reasons.
