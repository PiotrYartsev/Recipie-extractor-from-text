MAKES ABOUT 2 CUPS/480 ML
Vitello  tonnato is an Italian dish of cold sliced veal
slathered in an irresistible tuna-anchovy mayonnaise. The
veal is just a vehicle for the tasty mayonnaise, so I’m
skipping it here and focusing on the sauce. In this version,
I’m using some reduced broth as a quick substitute. Y ou
can serve this mayonnaise on any type of cold leftover
roasted meat or chicken, on grilled vegetables , on crostini,
or on seared fresh tuna—redundant, perhaps, but delicious.
