 
SMOKY RED PEPPER COULIS
MAKES 1 CUP/240 ML
This is a slight “upgrade” on a basic roasted red pepper
sauce. I like to use a mix of peppers (bell and pimiento are
great together) when I can ﬁnd interesting sweet varieties
at the farmers’ market, and I like the way the smoked
paprika extends that sweet pepper ﬂavor . Vinegar keeps
the sweetness balanced. I love this sauce drizzled over fat
grilled shrimp or slices of rare grilled ﬂank steak.
3 tbsp olive oil
2 lb/910 g mix ed sweet r ed peppers, stemmed, seeded, and
cut lengthwise into strips 1/2 in/12 mm wide
Kosher salt
1 large clove garlic, smashed
1 fresh r osemary sprig, 4 in/10 cm long
11/2 tsp Spanish sweet smok ed paprik a
1 tsp sher ry vinegar, plus mor e if needed
In a heavy , medium frying pan, heat the oil over medium
heat. Add the peppers, 1 tsp salt, garlic, and rosemary .
Cover , and cook the peppers until they start to release
some steam, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-
low and cook the peppers slowly until they become very
soft and sweet and have released some juices, about 30
