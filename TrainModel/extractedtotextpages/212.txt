TO COOK THE LIVER,  heat a medium skillet over medium-
high and add the butter . When it begins to sizzle, quickly
dredge the liver in ﬂour , arrange in the pan, and season
generously with salt and pepper . Cook until the ﬁrst side is
nicely browned, about 2 minutes, ﬂip to the second side,
season again, and cook just until browned, another 1
minute. Do not overcook liver—it should be rosy pink inside
—so check by cutting a piece.
Spoon a nice bed of the warm potatoes on each plate,
arrange the liver on the potatoes, drizzle both with the
cream sauce, and top with a tangle of friend shallots. Serve
right away .

SERVES 2 AS A FIRST COURSE
This is a delicious dish, but also rich, so I like to serve it as
a ﬁrst course (smaller portions!) for special dinners. My
philosophy of menu planning is to serve a ﬁrst and a last
course with fanfare and fuss and make the middle courses
simpler . For the cook, this isn’t a fussy dish, however ,
because you can make the sauce ahead of time and keep it
warm, and then cook the seafood in the sauce just before
you combine it with the pasta. If you want to keep things
even simpler , make the dish with only one of the shellﬁsh in
the title.
