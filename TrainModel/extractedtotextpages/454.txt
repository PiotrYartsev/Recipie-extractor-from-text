* You will need— saucepan, 
wooden spoon, baking tray, 
baking paper, weight, liquid and spoon measures and piping bag.
* Choux pastry— also known 
as ‘pâte à choux’— is used 
for many dishes, sweet and savoury, from profiteroles  
and éclairs to cheese puffs and potato Dauphine (mashed potato mixed with choux paste and deep-fried).
* It is important to use 
bread (strong) flour in choux pastry as the higher proteins in the flour produce greater gluten elasticity making lighter puffs. Use plain flour if only making choux pastry on rare occasions.
* Adding the flour to the 
boiling water is also very important to ensure the starches in the flour swell and absorb the water instantly.* Often recipes for choux 
pastry use whole eggs. Using mostly egg whites will guarantee a lighter, crispier and drier puff. For a lighter puff again, try reducing the water content in the recipe by 50 ml and adding another egg white at the end— be 
aware that the resultant puff, although light in texture, will have a stronger egg flavour.Method cont.
