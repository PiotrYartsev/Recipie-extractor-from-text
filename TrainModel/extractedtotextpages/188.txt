What’s important is the weight and heat-transferring
capacity of the pan. Copper and aluminum, such as the
aluminum core in three-ply cookware, are good choices. I
would not use a tin-lined copper pan, however , because the
tin wears out quickly , leaving exposed copper that can
develop a mildly toxic oxide, and the tin can react with the
stainless tines of a whisk and turn your sauces a pale gray .
The sloped sides are important because they allow for
maximum evaporation—reduction—even with a small
amount of liquid. Plus, they make it easy for your whisk,
wooden spoon, or (my favorite) heat-resistant rubber
spatula to reach the angles at the bottom of the pan.
A ﬁne-mesh sieve is useful for losing lumps but also for
straining out aromatics, herbs, and the like. A whisk is
important too, especially for the roux -based sauces. May I
say boo-yah to the inventor of the whisk, whoever he or she
may be?
STORAGE
Cream sauces can be stored in an airtight container in the
refrigerator , though I ﬁnd that the ﬂour-thickened ones get
a touch tired after 3 or 4 days. I think cream sauces are
meant to be made and used for a speciﬁc purpose, unlike a
vinaigrette or caramel sauce, which can stand by in the
fridge for all sorts of impromptu uses. All of these sauces
can be reheated using very gentle heat, whether stove top
or microwave.
