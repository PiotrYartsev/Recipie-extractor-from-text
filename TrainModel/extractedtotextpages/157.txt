In a small saucepan, combine the lemon juice, vinegar , and
shallot and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.
Cook, stirring and scraping the sides of the pan
occasionally with a heat-resistant rubber spatula, until the
liquid is reduced to about 2 tbsp, 4 to 5 minutes.
Add the butter and start stirring it around in circles with a
whisk, a fork, a wooden spoon, or anything that lets you
“stab” the hunk of butter so that you can move it around
easily . The butter will start to melt and the mixture will
bubble and boil around the edges. The melted butter
should look creamy , rather than melted and oily . Keep
stirring and blending until almost all of the butter is
incorporated, then remove the pan from the heat as you
work in the last bit. Whisk in the capers, parsley , lemon
zest, 1/4 tsp salt, and a few generous grinds of pepper . Taste
and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed. If
the sauce is still very sharp, whisk in another 1/2 tbsp cold
butter . If possible, serve right away .
STORAGE  To keep the sauce war m, hold it in the saucepan
for a few minutes. F or longer k eeping, transfer it to a bowl
set over a saucepan of hot water (the water should be no
hotter than 110°F/43°C). Y ou can also k eep the sauce in a
thermos for up to 2 hours. The sauce cannot be stor ed in
the refrigerator, as it will separate when r eheated.
QUICK CHANGE  Omit the parsley and add 1 tbsp chopped
fresh dill and 2 tsp ﬁnely diced cor nichon with the capers.
