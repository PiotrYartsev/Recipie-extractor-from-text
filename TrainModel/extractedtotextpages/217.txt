MAKES ABOUT 1 1/2 CUPS/360 ML
Grocery-store eggs make perfectly good mayonnaise, but
taste mayo made with fresh, ﬂavorful eggs from the
farmers’ market, or maybe from your own chickens, and
you’ll understand why it’s regarded as an important sauce.
Sometimes farmers’ market eggs are smaller or larger than
a “large” egg from the supermarket, so pay attention to
their size and adjust your other ingredients as needed. The
other critical element here is the oil, which must also be
fresh. And this is not the time to use an olive oil with a big
ﬂavor . A neutral-ﬂavored vegetable or seed oil or a mild
and fruity extra-virgin olive oil allows the creamy ﬂavor to
stay balanced.
