Transfer about half of the cooked fruit to a ﬁne-mesh sieve
set over a medium bowl. Using a rubber spatula, push the
fruit through the sieve to purée it and remove the seeds
(you can do this in a food processor , if you like, but the fruit
should be soft enough to force through the sieve).
Stir the purée back into the rest of the sauce in the pan,
then add the lime juice and salt. F or a thicker sauce, cook
for a few more minutes (but not so much that it gets
“jammy”; the sauce will thicken as it cools). T aste and
adjust with more sugar or lime juice if needed.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5
days or fr eeze for up to 2 months.
QUICK CHANGE  Add 1/2 tsp peeled and ﬁnely chopped
fresh ginger to the ber ries with the sugar and water .
