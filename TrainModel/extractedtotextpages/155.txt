crème fraîche, bring to a simmer , and simmer until slightly
reduced, about 30 seconds.
Add the butter and start stirring it around in circles with a
whisk, a fork, a wooden spoon, or anything that lets you
“stab” the hunk of butter so that you can move it around
easily . The butter will start to melt and the mixture will
bubble and boil around the edges. The melted butter
should look creamy , rather than melted and oily . Keep
stirring and blending until almost all of the butter is
incorporated, then remove the pan from the heat as you
work in the last bit. Add 1/4 tsp salt and a pinch of pepper .
Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if
needed. If the sauce is still very sharp, whisk in another 1/2
tbsp cold butter .
For a perfectly smooth sauce, strain it through a ﬁne-mesh
sieve. If you are okay with the shallot, serve as is. If
possible, serve right away .
STORAGE  To keep the sauce war m, hold it in the saucepan
for a few minutes. F or longer k eeping, transfer it to a bowl
set over a saucepan of hot water (the water should be no
hotter than 110°F/43°C). Y ou can also k eep the sauce in a
thermos for up to 2 hours. The sauce cannot be stor ed in
the refrigerator, as it will separate when r eheated.
QUICK CHANGE  Use Meyer lemon juice instead of the
regular lemon juice and add 1/2 tsp lightly pack ed ﬁnely
grated Meyer lemon zest af ter adding the butter .
