The Really UsefUl InfoRmaTIon 545Basic pantry essentials
A well-stocked kitchen pantry is fundamental to good cooking; however, even the most basic 
of pantry ingredients can deliver a meal when it appears all is lost. This basic list is one that should be maintained regularly—because of the influences of a multicultural society, it may appear to some cooks as if I have left out some great staples. It is certainly up to the individual cook to add to this list based on their own experiences and influences—it may be that one cook’s anchovies are another cook’s fish sauce, but to include both these ingredients is to then provide a pantry list that moves from basic to gourmet. Remember to use this as a guide and then add a few of your own favourite pantry items that you could not live without. 
I have deliberately omitted from the list any pre-packaged foods relating to the school 
lunch box. This, in part, is due to the fact that pre-packaged foods are rapidly growing in number, as is the concern for the health benefits they may or may not offer. From a parent’s point of view, it is too subjective to decide what basic lunch box items should be included.
