With its comforting broth and soft, velvety texture, wonton soup always brings back child -
hood memories. Mom and I had an agreement: if she needed me to help fold wontons, I’d 
fold them while watching Saturday morning cartoons.
8 ounces shrimp, peeled 
and deveined
1 (4-ounce) can sliced 
bamboo shoots, drained 
and chopped
1/2-inch piece fresh ginger, 
peeled and minced
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 teaspoon light soy sauce
24 store-bought wonton 
wrappers
Cornstarch slurry (see 
page 26)
8 cups Wonton Soup Broth 
(page 90)
3 scallions, white and green 
parts, thinly sliced
Mix it uP: Add some variety 
and color to your soup by serv-
ing these with Tofu and Carrot 
Wontons (page 43).1. Make the filling: Roughly chop half the shrimp and 
set it aside. Finely chop the remaining shrimp, cre-
ating a shrimp paste, and place it in a medium bowl. 
Fold in the roughly chopped shrimp pieces. Add the 
bamboo shoots, ginger, sesame oil, and soy sauce. 
Gently stir together until thoroughly combined.
2. Fold the dumplings: While working, keep the wrap-
pers covered. Lay 6 wrappers on a cutting board and 
place 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of each. 
Moisten the outer edge of the wrappers with corn-
starch slurry.
3. Fold the dumplings using the Classic Wonton Fold 
(see page 28).  Repeat with the remaining wrappers 
and filling.
4. Cook and serve: In a medium stockpot, bring the 
wonton broth to a boil, then reduce the heat to 
medium-high. Add the wontons and simmer for 3 to 
4 minutes until cooked through, or until the wrap-
pers turn translucent.
5. Divide the wontons and soup among warmed 
bowls and garnish with scallions. Cool for at least 
1 minute, then serve.
