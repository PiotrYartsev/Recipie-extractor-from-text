THE METHOD
Read through these steps a few times before you embark
on making gravy so that you understand how the steps ﬂow
from one to the other . After that, you can use this “cheat
sheet” to remind you of what to do next.
1. Set the meat or poultry roast on a platter that allows you
to capture more juices, which are sure to ﬂow . Or, put it
on a cutting board resting on a rimmed baking sheet.
Tent the roast with aluminum foil.
2. Without scraping or disturbing anything, gently pour oﬀ
the juices and fat into a gravy separator or tall
measuring cup. A void vigorous movement that will
create turbulence that can emulsify the fat into the
juices. Y ou want them to remain as separate as
possible.
Leave the juices and fat to settle, then spoon or pour oﬀ
the fat into another container .
3. Put your roasting pan over a couple of stove-top burners
and turn the heat to medium. If your pan ﬁts over only
one, be sure to slide it around as needed to heat all of
the surfaces evenly . Bring things to a gentle sizzle
before adding anything. This allows any lingering free-
running juice to caramelize, too . The French call this
pincer les sucs (paan say lay SOOK), or roughly “to
tighten the meat juices.”
4. Add the measured amount of fat to the pan. Use 1 tbsp
fat per 1 cup/240 ml liquid. Now add the ﬂour (1 1/2 tbsp
per 1 cup/240 ml liquid). Whisk the fat and ﬂour
together rapidly , incorporating the brown bits that want
