459* You will need— bowl, pasta 
machine, rolling pin and food 
processor.
* Fresh pasta doesn’t need 
to be hung over a broom handle to dry out unless you plan on storing it in an airtight container for a month or two. Otherwise dust it in plenty of fine semolina and keep refrigerated for 2– 3 
days, after which it begins to turn grey.
* Pasta flour or 00 
flour—available at good 
delicatessens— is different 
to plain flour in that it has a higher gluten content, which means it can tolerate the constant stretching through a pasta machine without tearing; plain flour, being softer, needs to be handled gently when rolling.
* A gluten-free pasta can  
be made using— 250 g potato 
flour, 250 g rice flour,  
½ teaspoon salt,  
1-½ teaspoons xanthan gum, 
½ teaspoon guar gum, 4 eggs, 
1 tablespoon olive oil. Mix the flours, salt and gums together, make a well in the centre and add the eggs. Work the flour into the eggs and when a dough begins to form, knead the dough for  5 minutes. Allow to rest for 30 minutes before rolling out. Xanthan gum and guar gum are available from health food shops.
* Continental flour is a fine 
semolina also used for making pasta and is available at good delicatessens.
* Flours also have a 
moisture content making it difficult to be precise with the number of eggs (which vary in size), so the dough could become sticky or too dry. Therefore be ready to compensate by adding more flour if too sticky or some water should it be too dry and not coming together.
* See cooking pasta in the 
Really Useful Section for 
more tips on cooking pasta properly.
* Once the pasta is rolled, 
it is important to keep it from sticking together. This requires the cook to have a bowl of flour or semolina to one side so that the dough can be constantly dusted as it is rolled through the pasta machine. Once the pasta is cut to the desired shape, it will require more flour to be dusted over the cut pasta to account for the exposed edges which can become sticky. Shake off excess flour before dropping into the boiling water.* An important note for 
owners of a pasta machine —DO 
NOT WASH IT! Use a pastry brush to brush away excess or built-up flour on the machine. Washing will cause the components to rust, and any built-up flour to become pasty and set hard, as well as the rollers losing their very smooth surface.
