 
POTATO OMELET with ROASTED GREEN
CHILE and TOMATILLO SAUCE with
AVOCADO
SERVES 2
This is deﬁnitely a weeknight, make-dinner-from-what’s-in-
the-fridge dish, but one that rewards you highly for modest
eﬀort. Y ou need to have the chile sauce already made, but if
for some reason you don’t, it’s okay to use a good salsa
verde  from a jar and add some avocado . I like Desert
Pepper Trading Company and Frontera brands, but many
other good ones are on the market.
