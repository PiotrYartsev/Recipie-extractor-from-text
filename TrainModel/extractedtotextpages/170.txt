 
SOY-GINGER BUTTER SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 1/4 CUP/60 ML
This sauce surprised me when I ﬁrst made it. I intended to
make something fairly light, with a bright, gingery kick.
Instead, I ended up with a deep, savory , and slightly
mysterious sauce with a distinctly “meaty” ﬂavor . This is
because as the soy sauce reduces, it starts to toast a bit,
deepening its umami ﬂavors. Use a good-quality soy sauce,
such as Kikkoman brand. A t my house, we call this sauce
vegetarian gravy . We’re not actually vegetarian, so we’ll
drizzle the sauce on slices of rare ﬂank steak or leg of
lamb. It’s also delicious tossed with green vegetables such
as green beans, broccoli, or broccoli rabe.
