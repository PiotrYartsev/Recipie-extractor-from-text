In a small saucepan, combine the cider , shallot, and pepper
and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook,
stirring and scraping the sides of the pan occasionally with
a heat-resistant rubber spatula, until the liquid is reduced
to about 2 tbsp, 15 to 20 minutes.
Add the butter and start stirring it around in circles with a
whisk, a fork, a wooden spoon, or anything that lets you
“stab” the hunk of butter so that you can move it around
easily . The butter will start to melt and the mixture will
bubble and boil around the edges. The melted butter
should look creamy , rather than melted and oily . Keep
stirring and blending until almost all of the butter is
incorporated, then remove the pan from the heat as you
work in the last bit.
Whisk in 1/4 tsp salt, then taste and adjust the seasoning
with more salt, pepper , or a touch more butter . For a
perfectly smooth sauce, strain it through a ﬁne-mesh sieve.
If you are okay with the shallot, serve as is. If possible,
serve right away .
