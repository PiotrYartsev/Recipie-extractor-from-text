PAN-FRIED AND FRIED 
DUMPLINGS
These dumplings are popular for their crispy, crunchy texture. 
Pan-fried dumplings are first steamed, then lightly fried with a small 
amount of oil to create a golden-brown crust. Deep-fried dumplings 
don’t require steaming and yield extra crispy wrappers with a tender 
filling inside. Here, you’ll find classics like potstickers and fried 
wontons, as well as some creative takes on traditional flavors.
