see just the tiniest wisps of smoke, 9 to 12 minutes. The
caramel will be very hot at this point. Remove the saucepan
from the heat and carefully add a little bit of the cream; the
caramel will bubble up furiously .
Return the pan to low heat and whisk in the remaining
cream a little at a time (to avoid bubbling over), then whisk
in the butter , 1/2 tsp salt, and the vanilla. P our the hot
caramel sauce over the chocolate, let it sit for a couple of
minutes, and then whisk until the chocolate is melted and
the sauce is smooth. T aste the sauce (donâ€™t burn your
tongue!) and add more salt, if you like. Let the sauce cool;
it will thicken as it cools. Serve warm or at room
temperature.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3
weeks or fr eeze in a ziplock fr eezer bag for up to 2 months.
QUICK CHANGE  Use milk chocolate instead of dark
chocolate and add 1 tbsp hazelnut liqueur such as
Frangelico af ter blending the caramel and chocolate.
