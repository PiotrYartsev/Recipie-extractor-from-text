SMOKED-SALMON BENEDICT BITES
MAKES 16 HORS D’OEUVRES
I learned to make these addictive hors d’oeuvres during my
one and only restaurant job, working as a cook in a small
café in Denver . We did a thriving Sunday brunch business
and usually had leftover hollandaise at the end of the shift,
which we put to excellent use in these buttery-crisp snacks.
I call for my version of classic hollandaise, but any of the
sauces in this chapter would work well with this recipe.
These hors d’oeuvres freeze beautifully , too, so they’re
ideal for make-ahead entertaining.
1/2 cup/120 ml Classic (but L emony) Hollandaise , chilled
1/2 cup/65 g ﬂak ed hot-smok ed salmon
1/2 cup/55 g shr edded F ontina or Havarti cheese
1 tbsp ﬁnely chopped fr esh chives
Freshly gr ound black pepper
16 baguette slices, 1/2 in/12 mm thick
Position an oven rack about 5 in/12 cm from the broiler
element and heat the broiler .
In a small bowl, gently fold together the hollandaise,
smoked salmon, cheese, and chives. Season well with
pepper .
