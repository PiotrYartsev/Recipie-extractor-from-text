 
LIGHT, LEMONY CREAM SAUCE
MAKES 3/4 CUP/180 ML
This sauce is all about the layers of ﬂavor that you create
by reduction, so take your time to simmer the liquids down
to concentrate their ﬂavors. Once you get the basic
architecture of this sauce, you can improvise like crazy—a
little saﬀron, some herbs, diﬀerent cheese—and you can
use it on many diﬀerent pastas, on light ﬁsh dishes, and on
green vegetables such as asparagus and broccoli.

green parts only)
