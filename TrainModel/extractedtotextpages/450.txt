* You will need— food 
processor, weight measures 
and plastic scraper. 
* This recipe makes enough 
for one tart.
* Also known as ‘pâte sablée 
sucrée’, this pastry is very short, because it has so much butter in it. The butter content means the gluten is unable to form, making it a very delicate, rich and soft pastry both raw and cooked.
* Unless you are a trained 
professional, rolling out and lining a pie dish or flan tin with sweet shortcrust pastry is nigh impossible because the pastry rips and tears very easily. For novice, intermediate and most domestic cooks, it is always suggested that the dough is broken into small pieces and scattered into the tin or dish and pressed into place. Rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before baking.
* This is a great pastry to 
simply roll into logs, dust in caster sugar and set cold in the fridge. Slice 5-mm discs from the cold logs and bake for 15 minutes at 180ºC to produce a tasty little shortbread biscuit. Once cold, try dipping the biscuits in melted chocolate for a treat at your next dinner party.50 g plain flour, sifted
