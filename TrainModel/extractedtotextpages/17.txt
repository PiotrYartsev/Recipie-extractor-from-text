19 A Step-by-Step Guide to Doughs and Folds Experimenting with different wrappers is the best (and most delicious) way to 
determine which shape and thickness is most appropriate. When eating out, order a 
variety of dumplings and pay attention to their folds, shapes, and the thickness of the 
wrappers. T ake photos for reference and recreate them at home. The best part is, you

WORKING WITH 
STORE-BOUGHT WRAPPERS
As Ina Garten says, “store-bought is fine!” I agree with her wholeheartedly 
when it comes to wrappers. Here are some tips for success when working with 
store-bought wrappers:
/uni25B8Keep the wrappers refrigerated and use them within five days of purchase.
/uni25B8The wrappers might be drier than homemade ones. Lightly mist with water from a 
spray bottle, then blot with a paper towel. Or, remove from the packaging and wrap 
the wrappers in damp paper towels for about 30 minutes before using.
/uni25B8Make the wrappers thinner by rolling them out with a small dowel or rolling pin. T rim 
to original size with a round cutter or paring knife.
/uni25B8The drier the wrapper, the more difficult it will be to pleat and seal the dumpling. Mix 
1 teaspoon (3 g) cornstarch with 1 tablespoon (15 g) warm water and moisten the 
edges of the wrapper using your finger dipped in the slurry before pleating. This will 
help glue the edges together.
