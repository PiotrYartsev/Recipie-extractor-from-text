1 lb/455 g medium Brussels spr outs, trimmed and halved or
quarter ed lengthwise if lar ge
3 tbsp e xtra-virgin olive oil
1/2 tsp chopped fr esh r osemary
Kosher salt and fr eshly gr ound black pepper
1/4 cup/30 g coarsely chopped walnuts
1/4 cup/60 ml Apple Cider–Chile Butter Sauce
Heat the oven to 400°F/200°C/gas 6.
In a large bowl, toss the sprouts with the olive oil, and
rosemary and season with salt and pepper . Spread them in
a single layer on a large rimmed baking sheet. Roast until
just tender , 15 to 18 minutes. The single leaves that fall
away should be dark and crisp, and the sprouts should be
tender when pierced with a knife but not mushy . Take a
bite, to be sure.
During the last 5 minutes or so of roasting, spread the
walnuts on a small baking sheet or pie pan and slide them
into the oven. Cook until lightly toasted, about 5 minutes.
Pour onto a plate and reserve.
