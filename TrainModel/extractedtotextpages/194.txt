Cook, whisking a lot, for about 1 minute. This will give the
ﬂour a nutty , rather than ﬂoury , ﬂavor .
Pull the pan oﬀ the heat and pour in about 1/4 cup/60 ml of
the milk. Whisk like crazy to form a smooth paste, then
whisk in the remaining milk (2 cups/480 ml if making a
sauce or 1 1/4 cups/300 ml if make a souﬄé base).
Return the pan to medium-high heat and bring to a simmer ,
whisking frequently and making sure to get into the angles
of the pan where the thick roux can accumulate. Simmer ,
whisking often, until smooth and glossy and no taste of
ﬂour remains, 8 to 10 minutes. As it simmers, be sure to
scrape down the sides of the pan where the sauce builds up
and whisk it into the sauce; otherwise you will end up with
lumps.
Turn the heat to low , add the cheeses, and whisk until
completely melted. Add the salt, black pepper , cayenne,
and nutmeg, then taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve
right away .
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3
days. R eheat very gently to ensur e the sauce doesn’t
separate. The sauce does not fr eeze well.
QUICK CHANGE  Use another cheese in place of the
Cheddar . I like aged Gouda, smok ed Cheddar, or R oquefort
or other blue. If using a blue or other str ong-ﬂavor ed
cheese, start with half the quantity listed and add mor e to
taste. But for all of the variations, k eep the P armigiano -
Reggiano, which boosts the overall intensity level.
