Dumplings for Beginners 30304. Bring two opposite edges of the wrap-
per together and pinch them together 
in the center.
5. Then, bring the other two opposite sides 
together and pinch in the center.
6. Pinch together each of the four “petals” to 
create an X, squeezing out any air from the 
dumpling before sealing the edges.
7. T ransfer the sealed dumplings to a plate and 
cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with the 
remaining wrappers and filling.
Fold #5: Soup Dumpling Fold
Aside from the pleated crescent, the soup dumpling fold is the other most recogniz-
able shape for classic dumplings such as Xiao Long Bao (page 52) or steamed momos. 
T ypically, these dumplings are steamed and reveal a tender, juicy filling inside once 
cooked. Y ou can use this folding method to create steamed baos as well. This fold 
starts out like the Pleated Crescent Fold (see page 27) but the pleating continues all 
the way around the edge of the wrapper, not just on one-half of the wrapper.
1. If using store-bought wrappers, in a small bowl, stir together 1 teaspoon (3 g) 
cornstarch and 1 tablespoon (15 g) warm water to create a cornstarch slurry. 
Skip the slurry if using homemade wrappers. The slurry helps store-bought 
wrappers stick together to seal (they have a drier consistency than homemade 
ones).
2. Lay 1 round wrapper on a cutting board and place 1 tablespoon (weight varies) 
of filling in the center. Use the back of the spoon to flatten the filling slightly.
