 
CREAMY WALNUT SAUCE
MAKES 1 1/2 CUPS/360 ML
Walnuts play a bigger role in many cuisines, such as those
of the Middle East and eastern Europe, than they do in
what we call American cuisine. This sauce is a marriage of
a traditional Turkish tarator  sauce and an Italian sauce
called agliata , with some meddling around of my own, of
course. It’s amazing how smooth and creamy the walnuts
become, and their slight nip of tannins gives a pleasing
edge to the sauce.
This sauce is particularly good on grilled vegetables,
especially asparagus and thick eggplant slices . It also
complements grilled ﬁsh, or it can be tossed with pasta and
then the pasta topped with grilled vegetables.
