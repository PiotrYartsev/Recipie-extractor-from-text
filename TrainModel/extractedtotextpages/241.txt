real eggy ﬂavor but if I buy eggs for this sauce in the
supermarket, I pick the latest “sell by” date I can ﬁnd. It’s
also worth using fresh, premium butter . You can’t get
around the fact that hollandaise is an indulgent sauce, so
just celebrate the ingredients instead. I use plenty of citrus
in the sauce, too—adding grated zest as well as juice—and
sometimes I brown the butter for even more ﬂavor .
I know it’s classic to prepare clariﬁed butter for making a
hollandaise. This is when you melt butter and separate the
clear butterfat from the water and the milk solids that
settle on the bottom of the pan. And it’s ﬁne if you want to
make a batch of clariﬁed butter . But I don’t like to fuss too
much when I cook, so I just melt the butter and pour
directly from the pan into my sauce, and if a little of its
water and milk solids come along, that’s okay .
HOW MUCH SAUCE PER SERVING?
Hollandaise is rich, so 1/4 cup/60 milliliters per person will
be plenty in most cases.
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT
You need a medium, wide, stainless-steel bowl and a
medium saucepan to sit below it as its double-boiler mate.
You also need a good whisk and a strong arm or a handheld
electric mixer . I like having a heat-resistant rubber spatula
handy for scraping the sides of the bowl as I’m whisking.
