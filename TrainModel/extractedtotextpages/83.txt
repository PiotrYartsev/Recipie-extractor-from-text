A rich, savory broth is essential to an excellent wonton soup. This recipe calls for premade 
chicken stock for more flavor instead of starting with water. Traditional Soup Wontons 
(page 37) make a classic combination with this broth, but you can also serve it with Fish 
and Napa Cabbage Dumplings (page 40).
2 pounds chicken 
parts (backs, necks, 
feet, wings)
8 ounces ham hocks or 
salt pork
4 cups chicken stock
1/2 head Napa cabbage, cut 
into chunks
1/ 4 cup dried shrimp
4 scallions, white and 
green parts separated, 
thinly sliced
4-inch piece fresh 
ginger, peeled
1 star anise pod
Kosher salt
Light soy sauce, for 
seasoning
1 batch cooked Traditional 
Soup Wontons (page 37)
2 tablespoons sesame oil
Cooking tiP: To save time 
and make a richer broth, use a 
pressure cooker for step 2 for 
40 minutes.1. In a large stockpot, combine the chicken and ham 
hocks and cover with water.  Bring to a boil and cook 
for 10 minutes. Drain the contents and rinse with 
cold water to remove any coagulated blood and 
foam.  Return to the stockpot.
2. Add the chicken broth and enough water to cover 
the bones by at least 1 inch. Add the cabbage, dried 
shrimp, scallion whites, ginger, and star anise.  Bring 
to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low 
and simmer, uncovered, for about 2 hours. Using 
tongs or a skimmer, remove and discard the solid 
pieces from the broth.
3. Line a fine-mesh strainer with cheesecloth, set it 
over a large saucepan, and strain the broth. Season 
to taste with salt and soy sauce. 
4. Divide the cooked wontons and soup among 4 to 
6 warmed bowls. Garnish with sesame oil and the 
scallion greens to serve.
