extra-virgin olive oil blended with nuts in the walnut sauce
or the reduced balsamic vinegar that gives nerve to the
butternut squash sauce .
Another key is cooking the main ingredient enough so that
its ﬂavor and texture are more concentrated than they
were in the ingredient’s original state, ensuring the sauce
delivers the necessary ﬂavor punch. Finally , it’s critical to
control the texture of these sauces. The primary
ingredients have seeds and skins and ﬁbers and chunks and
other textural elements that you need to wrangle.
WHAT CAN GO WRONG AND HOW CAN I
FIX IT?
These sauces are dependent on texture, whether ﬂuid and
ﬂowing or thicker and “dollopy ,” and that ideal texture can
be elusive, given the variation in the consistency of your
main ingredients. The methods for most of these sauces are
straightforward: puréeing and straining. Although these
techniques are seemingly simple, how you execute them
can make or break your sauce.
You can purée your sauce ingredients in a blender or food
processor , pass them through a food mill, or , if very soft,
push them through a sieve. The French use a sieve
designed speciﬁcally for this purpose called a tamis
(pronounced tah MEE), which is also known as a drum
sieve. (I bought one during cooking school, but after a few
years, I realized that I was only using it as a steamer
basket, so I sold it at a yard sale.)
THE BLENDER  will give you the best consistency . But, as
I’ve noted elsewhere, I think a blender can be a pain to use
