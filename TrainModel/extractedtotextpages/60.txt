Wood ear mushrooms lend chewiness to this filling, and the bamboo shoots add a nice 
crunch against the soft crystal dumpling skins. This uses a vegetarian stir-fry sauce made of 
shiitake mushrooms instead of the traditional oyster sauce. 
8 ounces baked tofu
1 carrot, halved
1 (4-ounce) can sliced 
bamboo shoots, drained
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 cup roughly chopped 
wood ear mushrooms or 
any other wild mushroom
2 teaspoons grated 
peeled fresh ginger
2 tablespoons vegetarian 
stir-fry sauce
Pinch ground white pepper
1 batch Crystal Dumpling 
Dough (page 21)
Nonstick cooking spray
Mix it uP: This filling is 
excellent inside a potsticker or 
wonton, too.1. Make the filling: In a food processor, combine the 
tofu, carrot, and bamboo shoots. Pulse until finely 
chopped.
2. In a skillet over medium-high heat, heat the vege-
table oil. Swirl to coat the skillet and add the tofu 
mixture, mushrooms, and ginger. Saut√© for 3 to 
4 minutes to cook off any moisture. Stir in the stir-fry 
sauce and white pepper and transfer the filling to a 
medium bowl to cool.
3. Roll out the wrappers and fold the dumplings: Cut 
the dough into 24 equal pieces (see page 24). Roll 
each piece into a 4-inch circle about 1/16 inch thick 
around the edges. Keep covered.
4. Lay 6 wrappers on a cutting board and place 
1 tablespoon of filling in the center of each.
5. Fold the dumplings using the Pleated Crescent Fold 
(see page 27). Repeat with the remaining wrappers 
and filling.
6. Cook and serve: In a 10-inch-wide stockpot or wok, 
bring 3 cups water to a boil.  Reduce the heat to 
medium to keep a simmer.
