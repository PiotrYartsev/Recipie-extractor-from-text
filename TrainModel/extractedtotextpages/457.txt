The Basics: a really useful cookB ook 46812 lemons
1 cup coarse salt
Method:
1. Wash and dry the lemons before salting, remembering 
that it is the skin only that is eaten.
2. use a sharp knife to make 2 vertical cuts in each 
lemon in a cross about two-thirds of the way through the lemon, but all the way along (do not panic if it cuts through, it is still good to use).
3. stuff the cuts in each lemon with plenty of salt.4. Place a lemon carefully at the bottom of a 
sterilised wide-mouthed glass jar. Proceed in this manner with the remaining lemons, compressing them into the far edges of the jar until no space is left and the lemon juice rises to the top.
5. seal with the lid and leave on the kitchen bench.6. More lemons may be added in the following 2–3 days 
as the lemon rinds begin to soften.
7. Make sure the lemons are covered with juice at all 
times, adding fresh lemon juice if necessary.
8. The lemons are ready to use when the rinds are very 
tender, 4–6 weeks.
9. rinse the lemons thoroughly and discard any flesh 
and seeds before using. refrigerate after opening. Preserved lemons will keep for up to 6 months in the refrigerator after opening.Preserved lemons
