To my mind, proﬁteroles are the
most P arisian of desserts,
probably because I had my ﬁrst
taste of them when I went to the
Sorbonne after graduating from
college as a French major . I was
with my newly acquired, older
(and slightly dangerous) French
boyfriend at the time, so the
experience was as intense as the
chocolate sauce! I’ve deviated
from the classic ﬁlling here (it’s
usually vanilla pastry cream or
vanilla ice cream) by ﬂavoring my
cream with cardamom, coﬀee, and caramel—bringing a bit
of Scandinavia to P aris—and by folding in whipped cream
for a lighter texture.
