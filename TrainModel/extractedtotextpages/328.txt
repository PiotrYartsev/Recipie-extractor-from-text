 
BLACKBERRY-ALMOND SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 1 CUP/240 ML
Blackberries were exotic to me until I moved to the P aciﬁc
Northwest, where late-summer hikes in the woods yield
handfuls of the wild berries and farmers’ market stalls oﬀer
big, dusky berries engorged with deep purple juice. And
although plentiful for a few weeks during late summer
when they’re in season, blackberries are nonetheless
temperamental. Even ripe ones can be tart, and all
blackberries are extremely seedy , which is why I always
strain my blackberry sauces.
This sauce is a treat on pancakes, crepes, or waﬄes or on a
fat slice of angel food cake, topped with whipped cream.
