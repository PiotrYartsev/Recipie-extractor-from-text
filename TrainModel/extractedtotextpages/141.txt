2 cups/480 ml F ruity and Spicy Dried R ed Chile Sauce
4 tbsp/60 ml olive oil
Twelve 6-in/15-cm cor n tortillas
1/2 cup/55g crumbled Cotija cheese
1/2 cup/120 ml sour cr eam
1 tsp fr esh lime juice
Heat the oven to 250°F/120°C/gas 1/2 to keep the
enchiladas warm.
To keep things from getting messy , set up your workstation
like this: P our the chile sauce into a shallow dish, such as a
pie plate. If you’re right-handed, set this to the left of the
stove and put the stack of tortillas within easy reach. Put a
large baking dish—a 9-by-13-in/23-by-33-cm dish is a good
size—to the right of the stove.
In a frying pan, heat 1 tbsp of the oil over medium-high
heat. Dip a tortilla into the chile sauce, coating on both
sides and letting a little bit drip oﬀ , and then lay the tortilla
in the hot oil. W atch out, as it will spit and sizzle. If there is
room in the pan, coat a second tortilla and add it. Cook for
30 seconds, turn, and cook on the second side for a few
more seconds until the tortilla is ﬂoppy and hot. Slip tongs
or a long, thin metal spatula carefully under the middle of
the tortilla, lift it carefully , and let any oil drip back into the
pan. Transfer the tortilla to the baking dish, fold it in half ,
and then in half again to make a loose triangle.
Repeat with the rest of the tortillas, adding more oil to the
pan as needed, and snugging the tortillas together in a neat
single layer in the baking dish. Crumble the cheese evenly
over the folded tortillas and pop them into the oven to
warm back up, 5 to 7 minutes.
