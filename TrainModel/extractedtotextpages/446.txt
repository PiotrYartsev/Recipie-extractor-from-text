HINTS AND TIPS:

457* You will need— cutting 
board, cook’s knife, spoon 
and weight measures, wooden spoon, sauté pan and baking dish.
* How many young cooks do 
you think have ‘invented’ a version of this dish with great pride on the night and little recollection of it the next day? That is the sort of dish nachos is: even the most rank amateur cook can have a go and succeed.
* What can possibly go 
wrong? Too much cheese and the whole thing becomes a large weapon. Too much sauce and the corn chips go soggy. Too much heat and the corn chips and cheese burn. Too little heat and the cheese in the centre won’t melt. In other words there are basic things that can spoil a relatively easy dish.
* What makes for a good 
nachos? This question asked of any dish, anywhere, will get the same answer and that is—it depends on who’s 
eating it. Some love loads of cheese and little sauce, others prefer to skimp on the cheese and so on and so forth. Adhere to the basic rules applied in my method and by all means personalise your nachos based on the love of some ingredients over others. Cooking is interpretational, a cookbook is a only guide and the cook has the right to enhance a recipe based on personal preference, market forces or even budget. No questions asked.
* Nachos loves being served 
with ice cold beer and tequila— refer to the second 
tip. Enjoy!
* Naturally there are easier 
ways to construct nachos than the one I recommend. It usually involves buying everything pre-made.
