BUTTERY APPLE BREAD PUDDING with
GINGER CARAMEL SAUCE and CRÈME
FRAÎCHE
SERVES 6
Whenever I make bread pudding,
I indulge in a fantasy about a life
in which I’m cooking for
farmhands or a big family or
some other situation in which I
need to make delicious food with
extreme economy , not letting
even a crust of bread go to waste.
But I don’t live on a farm, and
you can make a great bread
pudding from almost any kind of
leftover bread, with the exception
of “everything” bagels, perhaps,
or a dark pumpernickel. I rarely
have any leftover bread on hand, so if I want to make this
pudding, I buy bread expressly for it. Challah or brioche
makes a rich and tender pudding, and white artisanal
loaves make a denser but still delicious pudding. Y ou can
serve this dessert warm from the oven or cold the next day ,
