Heat the oven to 325°F/165°C/gas 3. Spread the walnuts in
a pie pan or rimmed baking sheet, place in the oven, and
toast lightly , 6 to 8 minutes. They should be just fragrant
and beginning to take on color but not turning deep brown.
Pour onto a plate and let cool.
Meanwhile, rip the bread into pieces, put it in a small bowl,
add the broth and vinegar , and toss to moisten evenly .
Leave to soak for about 15 minutes.
In a food processor , combine the cooled nuts, the bread and
any remaining liquid, and the garlic and process until a
thick purée forms, stopping as needed to scrap down the
sides of the work bowl. W ith the motor running, drizzle in
the oil to form a creamy emulsion. If the mixture seems a
bit thick and gloppy , pulse in a few tablespoons of water .
Season generously with salt and pepper and taste and
adjust with more vinegar if needed. Serve at room
temperature.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 2
days. The sauce does not fr eeze well.
QUICK CHANGE  Add 1/2 cup/55 g sliced yellow onion to the
processor with the nuts and br ead.
