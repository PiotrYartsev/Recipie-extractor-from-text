The Basics: a really useful cookB ook 558Basic preserving
Preserving can mean many things to many cooks on many levels. The beginner cook may not 
realise that by simply chopping leftover fresh herbs, placing them in an airtight container and freezing them is a method of preserving, and a great one at that. A Greek friend of mine who is a great cook employs this method and has an abundance of fresh, frozen herbs ready to be part of in the many traditional dishes she cooks. 
From the simple preserving method of freezing to the more complex array of jams, 
jellies, chutneys, pickles, mustards, fruit candies, sauces, bottled fruits, smoked, cured and dehydrated, preserved foods is a ritual that in a few short generations went from a necessity born from recessions and depressions to a seldom practised art form reserved for passionate stall holders at farmers’ markets.
In this book there are some classic recipes for relish, marmalade, jam and chutney, so 
I’ve included a guide to basic preserving.
Basic equipment
* Heavy-based stainless steel saucepan or pot 
* Set of plastic funnels
* Sugar thermometer
* Cutting board
* 20-cm cook’s knife and paring knife
* Strong, heatproof jug 
* Labels for dating and naming
* Measuring equipment—cup, liquid, weight and spoon measures
* Several wooden spoons
* Strainer
* Storing jars and bottles with lids
sterilising
Use glass jars with matching lids. Jars need to be washed in soapy water, rinsed well and 
drained (do not use a towel to dry). Then place, right way up, in a cold oven and turn the oven temperature to 150ºC for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and fill with the hot preserves to be bottled. Metal screw-top lids to the jars need to be sterilised in the same manner. 
Boiling the jars in water for 10 minutes then drying in a cool oven (110ºC) is another 
method for sterilising. Rubber seals, corks and lids should also be immersed in boiling water for a few seconds.
packing
* Jams, marmalades, relishes, chutneys and sauces need to be packed while the mixture is 
still warm and the sterilised jars are hot from the oven. Leave to cool covered with a clean 
cloth. Once cool, cover the preserves with a circle of waxed paper or jam covers available from supermarkets.
* Jam, marmalade, relish and chutney jars should be filled right to the top.
* Sauces should be filled to within 2 cm of the rim.
* Pickles can be added cold to a jar as the high concentration of vinegar will inhibit 
mould.
