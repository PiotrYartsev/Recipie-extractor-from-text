control the amount of salt in the sauce. If you have access
to specialty butters, such as a cultured European-style
butter or a seasonal butter from a local dairy , by all means
use them in your butter sauces. But even if you are using
supermarket butter , be sure it is as fresh as possible. If you
notice a darker outer layer when you cut into a stick, the
butter has gotten old and oxidized. Replace it with a fresh
package.
The French have a rather more limited view of this type of
sauce than I do . They make butter sauces two ways: the
classic beurre blanc, made with white wine and white wine
vinegar , and a red wine–vinegar version, called beurre
rouge. But don’t let French rules stand in your way . The
method for making a butter sauce is wide open for
improvisation, and you can make your butter sauces based
on just about anything acidic that you can think of , from
balsamic vinegar to lemon juice to apple cider to soy sauce
or even beer . Anything will work that can be reduced to an
acidic and ﬂavorful base to which the cold butter can be
added.
WHAT CAN GO WRONG AND HOW CAN I
FIX IT?
In general, only two things can go wrong with a butter
sauce. First, you let your liquids reduce too much. It is easy
to do: walk over to the fridge to get the butter and when
you return your pan is totally dry . But wait! If the liquid has
totally evaporated but the dry glaze has not burned at all,
just pull the pan oﬀ the heat and add 2 tablespoons of
water to “reconstitute” it—no worries. If you can see or
smell that the reduction has started to caramelize or even
