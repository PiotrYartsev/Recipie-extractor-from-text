 
CLASSIC BEURRE BLANC (WHITE BUTTER
SAUCE)
MAKES ABOUT 1/2 CUP/120 ML
A beurre blanc (pronounced buhr blahnk) is like an elegant
version of melted butter and lemon, and it’s just about as
easy to make. The texture here is as important as the ﬂavor
—in fact, the texture contributes to the smooth ﬂavor—so
pay attention when incorporating the butter to make sure
that it blends well and emulsiﬁes into a creamy sauce. My
method accomplishes this over high heat, but if you’re
nervous working over high heat, you can cut the butter into
several pieces and work in the pieces one by one over low
heat.
A beurre blanc is at once light and rich, so it is best on
lighter foods, such as ﬁsh and shellﬁsh, chicken, and
vegetables. This classic version is straightforward and a
perfect canvas for fresh herbs, if you want to dress it up a
bit.
1/4 cup/60 ml dry white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc
1/4 cup/60 ml white wine vinegar
1 tbsp minced shallot
1/2 cup/115 g very cold unsalted butter in one piece, plus 1/2
tbsp if needed
