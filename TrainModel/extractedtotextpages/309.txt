 
MAPLE-NUTMEG CUSTARD SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 1 1/4 CUPS/300 ML
The ﬂavors in this creamy sauce are fairly subtle, so aim for
balance. Using grade B maple syrup will give you a more
pronounced maple ﬂavor , and take care that the nutmeg
doesn’t overwhelm the maple. I use a rasp-style grater
(mine is made by Microplane) to grate my fresh nutmeg.
This sauce has a close-your-eyes-and-you’re-in-a- Vermont-
farmhouse kind of character , which is why I especially like
it with apple desserts. Maple also likes walnut, so a walnut
tart or walnut-studded spice cake would be a lovely
partner , too.
