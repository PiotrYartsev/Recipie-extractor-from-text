SABAYON SAUCES
SABA YON IS THE SWEET SISTER TO HOLLANDAISE.
CALLED ZABAGLIONE IN IT ALY, sabayon gets its luscious,
ﬂowing consistency and rich ﬂavor from whipping egg
yolks over very low heat, just like hollandaise. But unlike
hollandaise, sabayon does not include any butter . It is
simply egg yolks, sugar (or honey), and traditionally a
sweet fortiﬁed wine, such as Marsala. I love the slightly

or wineglass for a special touch. It is especially good when
you fold in some whipped cream, pile the whole thing in a
pretty glass, chill it, and then eat it like a mousse. Or , you
can take that lightened sabayon and use it as a delicious
and surprising alternative to plain whipped cream on a
berry shortcake. As a sauce, however , it’s gorgeous over
fresh fruit, especially berries and stone fruits such as
apricots, peaches, and plums, or as a complement to a fruit
galette or tart.

and fortiﬁed wine (or other ﬂavorings) over low heat,
usually in a double boiler (unless you’re a daredevil). As the
