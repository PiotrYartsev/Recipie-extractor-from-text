the heat to low and continue to cook, stirring often, until
the onion is very soft, fragrant, and deeply golden but not
browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Add the curry powder and
ginger and cook for 1 minute more. Transfer the onion
mixture to a plate and let cool completely .
In a food processor , combine the cooled onion mixture, lime
juice, vinegar , sugar , mustard, and 1/2 tsp salt and pulse
until well blended. Add the egg yolks and process until the
mixture is mostly puréed. W ith the motor running, begin
adding the remaining 3/4 cup/180 ml oil in a very slow
stream. Y ou may need to stop and scrape again. As the
mayonnaise gets thicker , you can add the oil faster . When
you have incorporated almost all of the oil, slow down and
watch the sauce closely . If you see oil starting to separate
out, stop adding oil; the yolks have absorbed enough. T aste
and adjust the seasoning with salt, sugar , and lime juice if
needed.
STORAGE : Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5
days.
QUICK CHANGE : Add 1 small jalapeño chile, stemmed,
seeded (if desir ed), and minced, to the pan with the onion.
