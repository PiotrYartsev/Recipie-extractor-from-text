rosemary ﬂavor isn’t strong enough, let steep for another 5
to 10 minutes. T aste the syrup often so you can remove the
rosemary when its ﬂavor is nice and strong but not
overwhelming. Rosemary can impart a sort of turpentine
taste if you leave it for too long. Discard the sprigs.
In a food processor or blender , combine the peaches and
raspberries and whiz until just shy of smooth (aside from
the raspberry seeds). Add about 2/3 cup/75 ml of the
rosemary syrup, process to combine, and then taste, adding
more syrup until you like the balance of fruit and herb. Add
1 tsp lemon juice and the salt and then taste and tinker
with the balance of ﬂavors by adding more lemon juice or
syrup as needed. Cover and refrigerate until chilled—this
sauce tastes best cold—before serving.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5
days or fr eeze for up to 2 months. The color may dark en a
bit.
QUICK CHANGE  Use half peaches (or nectarines) and half
apriums (a cr oss between an apricot and a plum).
