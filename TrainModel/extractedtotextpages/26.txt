Dumplings for Beginners 2828
STEP 6 STEP 8
6. Bring up the bottom edge and line it up with the top edge of the pleats. Press 
the edges together and seal the corners so the filling doesn’t leak out.
7. Holding the dumpling by the ridge of pleats on top, gently tap the dumpling on 
the board, creating a flat bottom. As you do this, use your fingers to help form a 
curved crescent. The dumpling should be standing straight up.
8. Place the finished dumpling on a baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. 
Repeat the process with the remaining wrappers and filling.
Fold #3: The Classic Wonton Fold
This is the folding process for the classic wonton dumpling, whether it’s boiled, then 
served in soup, or deep-fried.
1. If using store-bought wrappers, in a small bowl, stir together 1 teaspoon (3 g) 
cornstarch and 1 tablespoon (15 g) warm water to create a cornstarch slurry. 
Skip the slurry if using homemade wrappers. The slurry helps store-bought 
wrappers stick together to seal (they have a drier consistency than homemade 
ones).
2. Lay 1 square wrapper on a cutting board and place 1 tablespoon (weight varies) 
of filling in the center. Use the back of the spoon to flatten the filling slightly.
3. If using store-bought wrappers, dip the tip of your index finger into the slurry 
and moisten the edge of the wrapper around all four sides.
4. Lift the two opposite corners to meet, forming a triangle. Use your fingertips to 
seal the sides of the triangle while squeezing out as much air as possible.
