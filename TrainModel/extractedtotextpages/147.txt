evaporation and the narrower base helps keep your
reduction from spreading out too far and scorching. Y ou
can use a whisk to mix in the butter , but since you’re not
trying to incorporate any air , a heat-resistant rubber
spatula is a good choice. If you want a perfectly smooth
sauce, use a ﬁne-mesh sieve to strain out the shallots and
other aromatic additions. And if you make the sauce ahead,
like for a dinner party , you can keep it warm in a thermos
or over hot water (no hotter than 110°F/43°C) in a double
boiler .
STORAGE
Butter sauces are ephemeral—quick to make and meant to
be enjoyed soon thereafter . You can easily hold a butter
sauce for a couple of hours, but once it has cooled—which
means the butter has resolidiﬁed—it is not easy to bring it
back to life. If you have leftover butter sauce, refrigerate it
and then just scoop out a spoonful to dollop onto cooked
vegetables. Don’t try to re-create the satiny ﬂuid texture of
the original sauce.
