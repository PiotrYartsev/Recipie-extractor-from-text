If there’s a lot of fat in the pan, pour it oﬀ , but don’t rinse
the pan. Drop the spinach into the pan and quickly toss it
around to encourage it to wilt. Season with a bit of salt and
pepper and keep cooking until it’s tender and most of the
liquid has evaporated oﬀ , 30 seconds to 1 minute. Some
spinach gives oﬀ a lot of water , so if it’s getting tender but
is still quite wet, just pour oﬀ the excess water from the
pan, pressing on the spinach with tongs or a spoon to
release even more. T aste and adjust the seasoning.
Arrange a nice pile of wilted spinach on each warmed plate
and top with the pork medallions. P our any accumulated
pork juices over the pork and spinach, then drizzle a thick
ribbon of the butter sauce around the base of the spinach,
reserving a little of the sauce to pass at the table. Serve
right away .

A big platter of these Brussels sprouts makes a delicious
centerpiece for a fall dinner party . If you have a pork roast
or a roasted chicken to serve with them, all the better , but
the vegetables themselves may just steal the spotlight.
