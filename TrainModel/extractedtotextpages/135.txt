GOAT CHEESE and LEEK TART with
BUTTERNUT SQUASH SAUCE
SERVES 10 AS A FIRST COURSE
This is a simple-to-assemble appetizer pastry that is made
special by pouring a ribbon of autumn-colored sauce
around it. P epperidge F arm puﬀ pastry is easy to ﬁnd in
most grocery stores, but it isn’t made with butter so the
ﬂavor is not the best. Look for Dufour brand if you want an
all-butter pastry or make your own (I teach you how in my
cookbook Puﬀ).
