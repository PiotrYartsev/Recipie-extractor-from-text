Put the cocoa powder in a small bowl and add a few
spoonfuls of the coconut milk; stir to make a smooth paste
(it’s okay if a few lumps remain). Heat the remaining
coconut milk in a small saucepan over medium heat. When
hot, whisk in the cocoa-coconut milk paste and bring the
mixture to just below a simmer .
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the eggs yolks
and sugar until well blended. Do not whisk so much that
the mixture gets foamy , however .
When the cocoa-infused coconut milk is hot, slowly pour
about half of it into the yolk -sugar mixture, whisking
constantly until combined. Return the pan to medium-low
heat, then whisk in the yolk mixture. Cook gently ,
frequently scraping the bottom and sides of the pan with a
heat-resistant rubber spatula or a wooden spoon, until it
thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. It should register 180°F/82°C on
an instant-read thermometer .
Remove from the heat. F or a very smooth texture (or if
you’re worried that you’ve gotten some bits of overcooked
egg in the sauce), strain the sauce through a ﬁne-mesh
sieve. Let cool, cover , and refrigerate until chilled, at least
1 hour .
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5
days. The sauce does not fr eeze well.
QUICK CHANGE  Add 1 tbsp dark rum to the coconut milk
befor e you heat it.
