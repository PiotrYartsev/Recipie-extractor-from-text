 
CLASSIC VANILLA BEAN CRÈME ANGLAISE
MAKES ABOUT 2 1/2 CUPS/600 ML
So simple but so wonderful when it’s well executed: satin
smooth, lightly sweet, and perfumed with rich vanilla. Y ou
can use a high-quality pure vanilla extract instead of the
bean, if it’s more convenient. I think extract is ﬁne for most
dishes, but in this case, splitting and scraping the seeds
from the fragrant, leathery bean is a reminder that “plain”
vanilla comes from an exotic plant grown halfway around
the world. If you do use extract in this recipe, add 1/2
teaspoon just when you’ve ﬁnished cooking the custard.
2 cups/480 ml whole milk
1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
4 egg yolks
1/4 cup/50 g granulated sugar
Tiny pinch of k osher salt
Heat the milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until it
is just starting to steam; do not let it boil. Using the tip of a
paring knife, scrape the vanilla seeds from the pod into the
milk and stir to mix. Add the scraped pod, remove the pan
from the heat, and let steep for about 30 minutes.
