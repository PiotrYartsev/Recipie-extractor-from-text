FRUIT SAUCES
PART OF ME THINKS IT’S A SHAME TO DO ANYTHING
TO A PIECE OF RIPE FRUIT OTHER THAN BITE INTO IT .
Why mess with perfection? But the other part of me (maybe
the French-trained part) thinks that a ripe, juicy peach, a
silky mango, or a handful of perfumed blackberries begs to
be transformed into a sauce. The natural brightness of
ﬂavor , the yielding luscious textures, and the vivid colors of
fruit are all indispensable qualities of a successful sauce.
Fruit sauces are perfect with fruit desserts because they
amplify the ﬂavors already in the dish. But even more, I like
fruit sauces as a contrast to creamy ingredients, such as
ricotta cheese, ice cream, or puddings, where the bright
acidity of the fruit cuts through the richness of the creamy
dessert. Fruit sauces are also excellent partners for all
types of cake; the crumb of the cake soaks up the fruit
sauce in a wonderful way . Just think of a delicious juice-
soaked biscuit in a strawberry shortcake and you’ll know
what I mean.
Most of my fruit sauces are sweet and intended to pair with
desserts, but with a few nudges toward the savory side,
fruit can also become an exciting partner for meat, poultry ,
or ﬁsh.
