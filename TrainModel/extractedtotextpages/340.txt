 
SAVORY BLACKBERRY-BASIL SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 1 CUP/240 ML
Ripe blackberries have a heavenly perfume, and in this
sauce, I enhance that lovely fragrance with fresh basil.
Blackberries also tend to be tart, so I keep the tart ﬂavor
balanced by using a gastrique, or caramel dissolved with
vinegar . Depending on your berries, you may need to add
more sugar to taste, too . Even though Aleppo chile isn’t
always easy to ﬁnd, I’m calling for it here because it’s my
new favorite ground chile—fruity and almost winey , but not
superhot. If you don’t have Aleppo chile or another mild
chile powder on hand, you can use cayenne pepper , but
reduce the amount to a pinch. I love this sauce on grilled
chicken thighs, grilled pork chops, or sautéed turkey
cutlets.
