CLASSIC MACARONI and CHEESE with
CRISP CRUMB TOPPING
SERVES 3 TO 4
No innovation here, just a great mac and cheese. Even
though the dish is a major comfort food, it shouldn’t be
bland, so I use a good sharp Cheddar and a booster of
Parmigiano-Reggiano . The crumb topping also keeps things
interesting; you could add 1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
to the crumbs if you wanted to get fancy , and, of course,
the pasta will always welcome some bits of ham or sausage
or a handful of steamed broccoli ﬂorets.
3 cups/720 ml Sharp Cheddar Sauce
1/2 cup/55 g grated P armigiano -Reggiano cheese
1 cup/55 g coarse fr esh br ead crumbs
2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
10 oz/280 g elbow macar oni or other short pasta
2 tbsp k osher salt
Heat the oven to 400°F/200°C/gas 6. Bring a large pot of
water to a boil.
While the water is heating, in a medium saucepan, gently
heat the sauce over low heat. Add the cheese and stir until
melted. K eep warm. In a small bowl, toss the bread crumbs
with the butter and set aside.
Add the macaroni and salt to the boiling water , stir, and
cook until al dente, according to the package instructions.
Drain well, return the macaroni to the pot, add the sauce,
