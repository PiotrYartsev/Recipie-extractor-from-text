 
UPDATED “FRY SAUCE”
MAKES ABOUT 3/4 CUP/180 ML
At the risk of upsetting fry-sauce cultists, I think this is a
more delicious version than the classic, rather simple
mayo-ketchup french fry sauce that is revered in parts of
the W est. It retains the creamy-zesty balance of the
original, but the umami factor is much stronger thanks to
soy and W orcestershire sauce. This sauce is yummy paired
with salty-fatty french fries or just about any other fried
food.
1/2 cup/120 ml Classic Mayonnaise
1/4 cup/60 ml k etchup
2 tsp W orcestershir e sauce
2 tsp fr esh lemon juice
2 tsp soy sauce
4 drops hot-pepper sauce such as Sriracha
In a small bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, ketchup,
Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, soy sauce, and hot-
pepper sauce. T aste and adjust the seasoning with
additional lemon juice, soy sauce, and hot-pepper sauce
until the sauce is zesty but balanced.
