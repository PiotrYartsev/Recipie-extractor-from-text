2 or 3 mild peppers such as r ed bell pepper, Italian frying
pepper, or Anaheim chile, stemmed, seeded, and cut
lengthwise into slices 1/4 in/6 mm wide  3 cups/720 ml V ery
Mushr oomy P orcini Tomato Sauce
1/2 cup/120 ml water, if needed
1/2 cup/20 g coarsely chopped fr esh ﬂat-leaf parsley  10
oz/280 g dried egg noodles, fr eshly cook ed, tossed with 1 to
2 tbsp unsalted butter, and k ept hot
Generously season the chicken all over with salt and
pepper . In a large frying pan (12 in/30.5 cm is a good size),
heat the oil over mediumhigh heat. Add the peppers,
season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring frequently , until
lightly browned and starting to soften, 4 to 5 minutes.
Transfer to a plate.
Return the frying pan to mediumhigh heat; you shouldn’t
need to add any more oil. Arrange the chicken pieces, skin-
side down, in the pan in a single layer . (If they don’t all ﬁt
comfortably in a single layer , you’ll need to use a second
pan and a little more oil.) Reduce the heat to medium and
cook, turning once, until nicely browned on both sides,
about 7 minutes per side.
Pour oﬀ any visible chicken fat (save the fat and use it for
cooking potatoes another time; it is delicious), return the
peppers to the pan, and add the tomato sauce. If the sauce
doesn’t cover the chicken by about halfway , stir in up to 1/2
cup/120 ml water . Adjust the heat to maintain a nice
simmer , cover , and cook, turning the pieces once halfway
through cooking, until the chicken is cooked through and is
very tender when you poke it with a knife, about 30
minutes more.
