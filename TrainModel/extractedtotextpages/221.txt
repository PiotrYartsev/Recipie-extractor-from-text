 
SWEET ONION–CURRY MAYONNAISE
MAKES ABOUT 1 1/4 CUPS/300 ML
This is my ultimate mayo for chicken salad, whether the
salad ends up between slices of bread or as the center of a
composed salad plate . The mayo is also good with slices of
cold roasted turkey breast or oven-fried sweet potatoes, or
as a dip for crudités, especially carrots, cauliﬂower , and
tender celery hearts.
2 tbsp canola or other neutral vegetable oil, plus 3/4 cup/180
ml
1 cup/140 g chopped sweet onion such as W alla W alla or
Vidalia or yellow onion
Kosher salt

1 tbsp fr esh lime juice, plus mor e if needed
2 tsp cider, rice, or white wine vinegar
1 tsp granulated sugar, plus mor e if needed
1/4 tsp dry mustar d
3 egg yolks
In a medium frying pan, heat the 2 tbsp oil over medium-
high heat. Add the onion and 1/4 tsp salt and cook, stirring,
