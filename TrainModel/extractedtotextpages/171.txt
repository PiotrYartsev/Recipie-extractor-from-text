In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar , mirin, 2 tbsp of
the soy sauce, the garlic, and ginger and bring to a simmer
over medium heat. Cook, stirring and scraping the sides of
the pan occasionally with a heat-resistant rubber spatula,
until the liquid is reduced to about 2 tbsp, about 10
minutes. (I simmer the mixture over a lower heat than in
my other recipes because I want to allow enough time for
the ginger to infuse into the liquids.)
Add the remaining 2 tbsp soy sauce and simmer , stirring
occasionally , until reduced to about 3 tbsp, 2 to 3 minutes
more.
Raise the heat to medium-high, add the butter , and start
stirring it around in circles with a whisk, a fork, a wooden
spoon, or anything that lets you “stab” the hunk of butter
so that you can move it around easily . The butter will start
to melt and the mixture will bubble and boil around the
edges. The melted butter should look creamy , rather than
melted and oily . Keep stirring and blending until almost all
of the butter is incorporated, then remove the pan from the
heat as you work in the last bit.
Whisk in the lime juice and hot-pepper sauce. T aste and
adjust the seasoning if needed. If the sauce is still very
sharp, whisk in another 1/2 tbsp cold butter .
Strain through a ﬁne-mesh sieve, pushing on the ginger
pieces to squeeze out all their juice. If possible, serve right
away .
STORAGE  To keep the sauce war m, hold it in the saucepan
for a few minutes. F or longer k eeping, transfer it to a bowl
set over a saucepan of hot water (the water should be no
hotter than 110°F/43°C). Y ou can also k eep the sauce in a
