divided all of the sauces into two types: those that get their
body by thickening with a roux and those that are
thickened by boiling down the cream and other liquids to
reduce and concentrate them.
A roux (pronounced roo) is made by whisking together ﬂour
and fat, usually butter , to make a smooth paste into which
you whisk a liquid. F or a béchamel (also called a white
sauce), the liquid is either milk or milk and cream. Some
versions include onion, clove, bay leaf , and black
peppercorns for ﬂavoring. Every former home-economics
teacher is probably conﬁdent that he or she knows the
correct way to make the sauce, but in the end, all of the
sauces are essentially the same.
A béchamel is pleasingly bland—if you can imagine such a
thing—with a creamy texture but a light ﬂavor . Cooks in the
past used it as a stand-alone sauce, as witnessed by my
mother’s 1942 F annie F armer cookbook. The book had
many versions of white sauce, including one in which you
boil “oyster crabs” to add some ﬂavor . (I learned through a
1913 New Y ork Times article that oyster crabs are tiny
crabs that live inside an oyster , a delicacy that was rare a
century ago and, as far as I know , is nonexistent today .)
Today, béchamel is like a helping verb: it’s the sauce that
lets you build a cheese souﬄé, gratin of greens, or classic
lasagna. Y our goal when making it is to avoid lumps; to
cook both the roux and the sauce long enough to develop
some nice nutty ﬂavors, rather than the taste of raw ﬂour
and milk; and to balance the seasoning, accomplished by
tasting and adjusting.
Velouté sauce, a cousin of béchamel, also starts with a
roux, but it calls for broth as the primary liquid. Like
béchamel, velouté is not typically served as is, anymore.
