 
SHARP CHEDDAR SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 3 CUPS/720 ML SA UCE OR 2 1/3
CUPS/560 ML SOUFFLÉ BASE
This sauce, which is essentially a Mornay sauce, is either
comforting or sophisticated, depending on how you use it.
It’s the sauce for mac and cheese—comfort!—or the base of
a souﬄé—sophistication! I also like it on steamed
cauliﬂower and broccoli for something in between. F eel
free to play with diﬀerent types of cheese, too . This recipe
is a blank slate.
3 tbsp unsalted butter
3 tbsp all-purpose ﬂour
21/4 cups/540 ml whole milk if making a sauce, or 1 1/2
cups/360 ml if making a souﬄé base
1 cup/115 g lightly pack ed grated e xtra-sharp aged Cheddar
cheese

1/2 tsp k osher salt
1/8 tsp fr eshly gr ound black pepper
Pinch of cayenne pepper
Pinch of fr eshly grated or gr ound nutmeg
