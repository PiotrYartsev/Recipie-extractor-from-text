Dumplings for Beginners 2424 24Portioning and Rolling Out Your Wrappers
So, you’ve got your dumpling dough. Now, it’s time to turn it into dumpling wrap-
pers. Keep in mind, store-bought wrappers have way more than 24 in each package, 
whereas the dough recipes in this book yield about 24 wrappers. Y ou can scale up 
the recipe if you need more than 24 dumplings.
The best place to start is by cutting your dough into 24 equal pieces. Let’s walk 
through the steps:
1. Place the dough on a clean work surface. Using a knife or pastry bench 
scraper, cut the dough into two equal pieces. Wrap one half in plastic wrap 
and set aside.
2. Using the flat part of your palms, roll the dough into a 6-inch-long log, 1 to 
11/2 inches in diameter.
3. Using a knife or a bench scraper, halve the log crosswise. Then, halve each 
piece crosswise again to yield four equal pieces.
4. Cut each piece into thirds, making 12 equal pieces.
5. Roll each dough piece into a ball and place on a baking sheet. Cover with 
plastic wrap. Repeat the process with the reserved dough from step 1.
