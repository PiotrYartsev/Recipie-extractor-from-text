SPECIAL EQUIPMENT
You’ll need a saucepan with a heavy base. Thin pans tend to
have hot spots, which would cause the sugar to caramelize
unevenly . You’ll need a whisk, too .
STORAGE
Caramel sauces are quick and can be prepared right before
serving, if you like. P ersonally , I ﬁnd that their ﬂavor
improves with a little time, so I like to make them a day

a caramel sauce that you’ve made ahead. A gentle nudge in
the microwave or a few minutes in a saucepan over very
low heat should do the trick. Basic caramel sauces last a
long time—at least 3 weeks in the fridge—and they freeze
exceptionally well for up to 2 months.
OTHER ROUTES TO CARAMEL
There’s a whole class of caramel sauces that don’t start
by cooking granulated sugar (sucrose). There are milk

caramel sauces in this chapter: simple sugars are
