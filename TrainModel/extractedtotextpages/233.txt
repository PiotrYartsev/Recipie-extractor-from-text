This dish is delicious as written
here, but the recipe is also a
starting point for whatever calls
to me when I’m shopping on the
day I’m cooking it: sweet summer
corn, chunks of ﬁrm zucchini, or
fat white beans. Y ou can turn this
simple stew into a feast by
adding shrimp, mussels, and
clams.
5 tbsp/75 ml e xtra-virgin olive oil
1 small jalapeño chile, stemmed, seeded, and minced
11/2 tbsp chopped garlic
