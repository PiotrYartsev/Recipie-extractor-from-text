 
COCONUT-RUM CARAMEL SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 1 1/2 CUPS/360 ML
Here, you can use the thick layer of coconut cream that
settles on top of the thinner milk in a can of coconut milk or
you can buy a can of coconut cream. If you opt for the
former , be sure you don’t shake the can before you open it,
so the cream remains on top. If you decide to use the latter ,
don’t reach for cream of coconut (such as the popular Coco
Lopez brand) by mistake. It’s a totally diﬀerent product, full
of stuﬀ that you might be okay with if you’re making a piña
colada on vacation but not if you’re making this sauce.
