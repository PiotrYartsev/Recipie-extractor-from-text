The Basics: a really useful cookB ook 458Pasta dough
Makes approximately 500 g
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
500 g pasta flour or plain flour (see h ints and Tips)
1 teaspoon salt
4 eggs
Method:
1. using a food processor, blitz the flour and salt 
quickly before adding the eggs. Process until the dough begins to come together.
2. remove the dough from the machine and knead on a 
lightly floured benchtop. Work the dough for 5 minutes with your hands until it is smooth. cover and rest for 30 minutes before rolling out.
3. To roll out, cut the dough into 4 manageable 
pieces, roll out with a rolling pin, and pass each piece through the widest setting on a pasta machine. There is no need to dust the dough with flour as it rolls through, as this will only add more flour and make it heavy and stodgy when cooked.
4. continue to roll the pasta until it reaches the 
second last setting or even the last, depending on how thin you need it. after it is rolled, lightly sprinkle it with flour to stop it from sticking together. if cutting the pasta into shapes, allow it to sit and dry for 10 minutes before cutting.
5. To cook fresh pasta, bring at least 3 litres of 
water to the boil, add all the pasta at once, stir and cook for 2 minutes only, then drain and serve.
