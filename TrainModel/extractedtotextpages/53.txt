SESAME CHUTNEY
Makes 24 dumplings PreP  tiMe 1 hour Cook tiMe 20 minutes
These flavorful dumplings are inspired by Tibetan momos, which are traditionally served 
with a deliciously spicy tomato sauce. To morph this into a hearty soup, stir about 3 cups 
hot chicken stock into the sauce.
For the Chutney
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
3 garlic cloves, smashed
1-inch piece fresh ginger, 
peeled and chopped
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 (15-ounce) can crushed 
fire-roasted tomatoes
Pinch kosher salt
1 cup chopped fresh cilantro 
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon freshly 
squeezed lemon juice
For the ChiCken  
MoMos
1 cup shredded 
Napa cabbage
11/2 teaspoons kosher 
salt, divided
12 ounces ground chicken
1 shallot, roughly chopped1. Make the chutney: In a saucepan over medium heat, 
melt the butter. Add the garlic, ginger, and curry 
powder and sauté for 25 to 30 seconds. Stir in the 
tomatoes and simmer for 15 minutes.
2. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Season 
with salt, then blend the chutney using an immersion 
blender, or transfer to a standard blender and blend 
until smooth. Stir in the cilantro, sesame oil, and 
lemon juice. Set aside.
3. Make the filling: In a wire-mesh strainer, toss the 
cabbage with 1 teaspoon of salt and let sit over a 
bowl for 10 minutes, or until the cabbage has wilted. 
Squeeze out the excess moisture from the cabbage 
(no need to rinse it first).
4. In a food processor, combine the cabbage, ground 
chicken, shallot, garlic, ginger, curry powder, and 
remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Pulse to form a 
smooth paste.
5. Fold the dumplings: While working, keep the wrap-
pers covered. Lay 6 wrappers on a cutting board and 
place 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of each. 
Moisten the outer edges of the wrapper with corn-
starch slurry.
6. Fold the dumplings using the Pleated Crescent Fold 
(see page 27).  Repeat with the remaining wrappers 
and filling.
