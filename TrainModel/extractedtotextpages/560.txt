The Basics: a really useful cookB ook 572Cup measurements
What a luxury it would be if metric were to become the universal measurement, which seems 
rational in these modern times. See Weight and Liquid conversion tables for equivalents for US customary, British imperial and metric measurements.
tips for measurements:
* Cookbooks assume you will use proper cup and spoon measuring utensils. Household cups 
and spoons are not useful. Keep this in mind when working from these books, especially when 
baking delicate goods.
* Australian cookbooks tend to use a mix of metric and British imperial.
* US cookbook measurements refer to volume rather than weight for dry ingredients.
* Take particular care with cup measurements, as all three are different:
1 US cup = 237 ml1 British cup = 284 ml1 Australian cup = 250 ml
* When measuring with a cup or spoon, always use level quantity (scant) unless the recipe 
states ‘heaped’.
* Scant, as in scant ½ cup, or scant pinch of salt, is also known as a ‘struck measure’. 
It means just the measurement specified.
