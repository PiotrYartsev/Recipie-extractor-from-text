A Pavlova should be in every cook’s repertoire. It’s simple
to make and one of those desserts that you just can’t stop
eating because the textures are irresistible: the cloudlike
meringue base is crunchy on the outside but like the best
marshmallow on the inside, and the layer of luscious
whipped cream contrasts with the juicy fruit on top—it’s
dynamic.

1 tsp k osher salt
1 cup/200 g granulated sugar

4 minutes more. On low speed, gently beat in the
