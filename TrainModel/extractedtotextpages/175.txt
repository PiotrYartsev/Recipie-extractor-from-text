POTATO-TOPPED HALIBUT FILLET with
BALSAMIC BEURRE ROUGE
SERVES 4
Adding a crunchy potato topping and a drizzle of rich,
tangy sauce is an easy way to “upgrade” a plain ﬁsh ﬁllet to
ﬁrst-class status. This is a great dinner-party main dish
because much of the prep can be done ahead. Boil and chill
the potato that afternoon, but don’t grate it until it’s time
to cook or it will darken. And season the ﬁllets with the
mustard ahead, too . Make the sauce right before people
come over and keep it warm as directed in the recipe. All
that will be left to do is pat on the potato topping, bake,
and serve.
1 waxy potato, about 5 oz/140 g
Kosher salt and fr eshly gr ound black pepper
2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
Four 6- oz/170-g skinless halibut, salmon, or cod ﬁllets, about
1 in/ 2.5 cm thick
2 tbsp Dijon mustar d
1/2 cup/120 ml Balsamic Beurre Rouge
In a small saucepan, combine the potato with salted water
to cover by 1 in/ 2.5 cm and bring to a boil over high heat.
Reduce the heat to maintain a vigorous simmer and cook
until just tender when pierced with a fork, about 20
minutes. Do not cook to the point of mushiness or it will be
too hard to grate. Drain the potato in a sieve, let cool, chill,
and then peel away the skin.
