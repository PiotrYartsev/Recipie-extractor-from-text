continue cooking, stirring frequently , until the apples are
soft and beginning to brown, 5 to 6 minutes more. Stir in
the remaining 2 tsp sugar and continue to cook, stirring
often, until the apples look golden and yummy , another 2 to
3 minutes.
Transfer the apples to a large plate to cool. When they are
barely warm, fold them into the bread and custard.
Lightly butter the bottom and sides of a 2-qt/2-L souﬄé
dish or baking dish with high sides (you can use a
shallower , wider dish, but you will need to shorten the
cooking time). Transfer the bread-and-apple mixture to the
dish, spreading it evenly . Cut the remaining 1 tbsp butter
into small pieces and dot the top of the pudding.
Bake the pudding until it is ﬁrm and no longer jiggly in the
center and slightly puﬀed, 45 to 60 minutes. It can be hard
to tell when the pudding is completely done, so if you have
an instant-read thermometer , use it. The pudding should
register 160°F/72°C in the center .
Let the pudding cool brieﬂy . Meanwhile, in a small bowl,
whisk the crème fraîche to loosen it. Scoop portions of the
warm pudding onto small plates or into little bowls.
Garnish each serving with a generous drizzle of caramel
sauce and a nice dollop of crème fraîche. Serve right away .
