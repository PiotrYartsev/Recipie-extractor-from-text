add the liquid too slowly , the sauce in the pan gets so thick
that it is hard to incorporate more liquid without lumps
forming. But adding the liquid all at once makes it hard to
blend smoothly , too.
I get the most control if I pull the pan from the heat once
the roux is cooked, add about one-fourth of my liquid,
whisk like mad, and then return the sauce to the heat, add
the rest, and continuing whisking as the mixture comes to a
simmer and thickens.
