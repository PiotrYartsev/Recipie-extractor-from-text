to cook until they are tender when you bite into a slice but
are not too browned, another 1 to 2 minutes. W ith a slotted
spatula or tongs, transfer the potato slices to the towel(s)
to drain. Do not rinse the pan.
In another large frying pan, preferably cast-iron, heat 1
tbsp of the remaining oil. While the oil is heating, cut the
steak into two or three pieces, depending on what ﬁts best
in the pan. Season the steak pieces generously with salt
and pepper . When the oil is shimmering, add the steak
pieces and cook, undisturbed, until nicely browned on the
underside, about 3 minutes. Flip the steaks, reduce the
heat to medium-high, and continue to cook for 1 minute
longer for rare, 2 to 3 minutes longer for medium-rare, or
until done to your liking. (I hope that’s no more done than
medium-rare.) Transfer the steaks to a plate and tent with
aluminum foil to keep warm.
Return the potato frying pan(s) to medium-high heat, add
the remaining 1 tbsp oil, and heat until shimmering. Add
the potatoes and cook them a second time, ﬂipping them
when they are nicely browned on the ﬁrst side, about 1
minute. Sprinkle the garlic over all of the slices and cook
until the potatoes are nicely browned on the second side,
about 1 minute longer . Sprinkle with the parsley and divide
between two warmed dinner plates.
Slice the steak on the diagonal across the grain and divide
the slices between the plates. Spoon a nice dollop of the
warm hollandaise over the meat. P our any accumulated
juices from the steak over the sauce and serve right away .
