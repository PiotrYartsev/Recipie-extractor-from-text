Uncover , turn the heat to low , and cook slowly , stirring and
scraping frequently , until the onions have collapsed and are
starting to turn golden. A fter about 30 minutes, toss in the
rosemary and keep cooking, taking care to scrape the
bottom of the pan so nothing burns, until the onions are
sweet and deeply golden, 1 to 1 1/4 hours total.
Scrape the onions into a blender and return the pan to
medium heat. Add the crème fraîche and broth, bring to a
simmer , and deglaze the pan, scraping up all of the good
brown bits on the pan bottom. Add the contents of the pan
to the blender along with the lemon juice and process until
you have a smooth purée. T aste and season with a few
twists of pepper , then adjust with more salt, pepper , or
lemon if needed. If the purée is too thick, add a bit more
crème fraîche.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 4
days. The sauce does not fr eeze well.
QUICK CHANGE  Use olive oil instead of butter and
vegetable br oth instead of cr ème fraîche to mak e the sauce
vegan.
