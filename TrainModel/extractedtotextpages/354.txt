CARAMEL SAUCES
I GET A THRILL FROM MAKING CARAMEL.

NUANCED TEETERING -ON-THE-EDGE -OF-BITTER
CARAMEL  is an example of what I love most about cooking:
you start with one thing and you turn it into another , much
better thing.
In the case of caramel sauce, “much better” means divine—
sweet but with a nutty hint of bitterness for sophistication,
and with layers of ﬂavor that continue to unfold as you
savor it. If the world is divided into chocolate people and
caramel-ginger-lemon people (and I believe it is), I am the
captain of the caramel team.
A caramel sauce is an impressive sauce to make. Many
cooks ﬁnd it a bit mysterious, but with a little technique
work under your belt, you’ll be making caramel sauces that
are so incredibly delicious (and superior to commercial
caramel sauces), you’ll earn impressive cooking cred from
everyone you share them with.
WHAT’S GOING ON IN THIS SAUCE?
True caramel is sugar cooked to a temperature of around
350°F/180°C , which is the candy-making temperature at
which thousands of ﬂavor compounds develop. When a
caramel cooked to this temperature cools, it will be hard
and brittle, so to make it into a sauce you need to add
liquid. F or most of my sauces, I add heavy cream or crème
