crumbs, coconut, sesame seeds, and lime zest and season
with salt and pepper .
Working with one piece of chicken at a time, pound the
thicker end lightly with a meat mallet or a heavy frying pan
to create a uniform thickness. Using tongs, dip the chicken
piece into the ﬂour mixture, coating it thoroughly and then
shaking it to remove the excess ﬂour . Next, dip it into the
egg mixture, allowing the excess to drip back into the bowl.
Finally , lay the coated chicken in the coconut mixture, turn
to coat thickly and evenly , and press ﬁrmly to ensure the
coconut layer adheres to the chicken. Transfer to a rack.
Repeat with the remaining chicken. Let the chicken sit for
10 minutes before cooking so the crust ﬁrms up.
In a large frying pan, melt the butter with the oil over
medium-high heat. A fter the butter foams and the bubbles
subside and the oil is shimmering, place the chicken pieces
in the pan, arranging them so they are not touching one
another . Cook until well browned on the ﬁrst side, 3 to 5
minutes. Using tongs, ﬂip and cook the second side until
browned and the chicken is just cooked through, about 2
minutes longer .
Transfer the chicken pieces to a clean rack and blot with
paper towels. Serve right away with the butter sauce.
