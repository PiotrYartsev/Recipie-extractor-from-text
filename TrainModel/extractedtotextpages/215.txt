will be loose and almost pourable. If you use a blender or
food processor , it will be ﬁrmer and more puddinglike,
because generally more air is whipped into it. Which style
you make depends on what you plan to do with it: drizzle it,
slather it, or fold it.
WHAT CAN GO WRONG AND HOW CAN I
FIX IT?
The egg yolks and oil must be close to room temperature
rather than cold. I often ignore that kind of instruction in a
recipe because I’m too lazy or impatient to plan ahead, but
in this case, temperature is critical. The emulsion won’t
come together with cold yolks and you’ll be left with a
liquidy mess. This doesn’t happen every time, but it
happens enough that you don’t want to take the risk. (Tip:
To warm eggs quickly to room temperature, immerse the
whole eggs in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes.)
You also need to know when to stop adding oil. Add too
much, too fast and the emulsion will break, causing the
mayonnaise to separate or curdle. The best way to avoid
this is to add the oil a drop at a time in the beginning of
whisking, and then slowly add the oil in a more steady
stream as it comes together .
Some cooks suggest ﬁxing a broken mayonnaise by
whisking together another egg yolk and some mustard, and
then gradually whisking the broken sauce into it. That
works, but it’s easier and usually just as eﬀective to put 1
tablespoon of warm water in another bowl and gradually
whisk the broken sauce into the water .
