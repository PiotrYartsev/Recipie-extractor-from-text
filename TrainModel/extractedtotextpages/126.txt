halves is solid ﬂesh and the other has the seeds in it. Cut
the seeded half open lengthwise, scoop out the seeds with a
spoon, and discard them. Cut the ﬂesh of both halves into
1-in/2.5-cm cubes and set aside.
In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat.
Add the shallot and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until
soft and fragrant but not brown, about 1 minute. Add the
squash and sauté until lightly golden, another 3 to 4
minutes. Add the cider , thyme, and chile and simmer until
the cider is reduced to about 1/4 cup/60 ml. Add the water
and continue to simmer until the squash is very tender
when pierced with a fork, 4 to 6 minutes longer . Remove
from the heat, remove and discard the thyme and chile, and
let cool slightly .
Transfer the squash mixture to a food processor or blender
and process until a smooth purée forms. If the purée is at
all ﬁbrous, push it through a ﬁne-mesh sieve. Return the
purée to the pan over medium heat, add the vinegar , and
season with salt. If the sauce is too thick, thin it with a little
more water . Heat to serving temperature and whisk in the
butter . Taste and adjust the seasoning again before serving.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3
days or fr eeze in one or mor e ziplock fr eezer bags for up to
