Turkey necks have a lovely , sweet ﬂavor that is neutral
enough to work in all kinds of recipes. And because the
necks are full of cartilage, they give broth lots of body—so
much body that the broth will gel once it is cold. If you
can’t ﬁnd necks, you can use other turkey parts in this
recipe, such as wings or drumsticks.
An aside on terminology: Some sources insist that the term
broth is correct only when bones with some meat on them
are used, and the term stock is correct when bones without
meat are used. I have used the word broth throughout the
book. F or me, what is important is whether it tastes good
and is not overly salty , so that you can use it in reduced
sauces.
The bonus with turkey-neck broth is that the meat is
delicious—moist and silky , though not easy to extract (time
to use your ﬁngers)—and is good in salads, soups, tacos, or
risotto . And turkey necks are fairly inexpensive, so you can
create superior homemade broth for about the price of
canned.
I’ve created two versions of turkey broth here: a light one
in which the turkey and vegetables start out raw , and a
dark one in which you must roast or sauté everything
before you simmer it in water .
I never feel wealthier than when I have a freezer full of
homemade broth, packed in ziplock bags, labeled, and
ready for action. Freeze the broth in amounts that make
sense for your style of cooking, such as 1 cup/240 milliliters
or 4 cups/960 milliliters. Be sure to label each bag with the
quantity and the date.
