Even perfect fruit needs a ﬂavor boost to be made into a
sauce, and most fruit is far from perfect, especially the fruit
you ﬁnd in an average grocery store. If the fruit is
underripe, the sauce may be too tart and also just lack
ﬂavor . If the fruit is a touch overripe, the sauce may be ﬂat
and need sharpening up.
The only way to create a perfectly balanced fruit sauce is
by doing a lot of tasting as you make it. T aste the fruit
before you add any other ingredients so you have a sense of
its natural levels. Then get out your “tool kit”: citrus juice
(usually lemon or lime), sugar or honey , balsamic vinegar ,
salt, and something with spicy heat, such as cayenne or
Espelette pepper .
In most cases, a few drops of fresh lemon juice and some
sugar will do the trick. A squeeze of orange juice or a
drizzle of apple cider can also heighten the general
fruitiness. Balsamic vinegar is a secret weapon that, if used
judiciously , can easily dial up the sweet-tart balance. Spice
and salt should always be subtle, below-the-radar ﬂavors
that act as catalysts to make the other ﬂavors shine
brighter . The recipes in this chapter include these
ingredients, but feel free to add more of anything listed to
accommodate the personality of your fruit.
HOW MUCH SAUCE PER SERVING?
Portion sizes for fruit sauces vary quite a bit. F or a colorful
ﬂourish to a slice of tart, you’ll need 2 tablespoons per
person, but for a dessert where the fruit sauce is a key
element, such as the blintzes on page 208, aim for closer to
1/4 to cup/60 to 80 ml per person.
