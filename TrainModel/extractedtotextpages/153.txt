pan occasionally with a heat-resistant rubber spatula, until
the liquid is reduced to about 2 tbsp, 4 to 5 minutes.
Add the butter and start stirring it around in circles with a
whisk, a fork, a wooden spoon, or anything that lets you
“stab” the hunk of butter so that you can move it around
easily . The butter will start to melt and the mixture will
bubble and boil around the edges. The melted butter
should look creamy , rather than melted and oily . Keep
stirring and blending until almost all of the butter is
incorporated, then remove the pan from the heat as you
work in the last bit.
Pluck out and discard the thyme, and add the lemon juice,
1/4 tsp salt, and a few generous grinds of pepper . Taste and
adjust the seasoning with lemon juice, salt, and pepper if
needed. If the sauce is still very sharp, whisk in another 1/2
tbsp cold butter . If it is ﬂat, whisk in more lemon juice.
For a perfectly smooth sauce, strain it through a ﬁne-mesh
sieve. If you’re okay with the shallot, serve as is. If possible,
serve right away .
STORAGE  To keep the sauce war m, hold it in the saucepan
for a few minutes. F or longer k eeping, transfer it to a bowl
set over a saucepan of hot water (the water should be no
hotter than 110°F/43°C). Y ou can also k eep the sauce in a
thermos for up to 2 hours. The sauce cannot be stor ed in
the refrigerator, as it will separate when r eheated.
QUICK CHANGE  Substitute 1/2 cup/120 ml ruby port for all
of the r ed wine.
