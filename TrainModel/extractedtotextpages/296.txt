ﬁrm but not rock hard. Depending on how long the dough
was refrigerated, this can take 5 to 20 minutes. Lightly
ﬂour the work surface, place the dough on it, and roll out
into a round 12 in/30.5 cm in diameter and in/3 mm thick.
Gently roll the dough around the rolling pin and transfer it
to the prepared tart pan, centering it over the pan. Unroll
the dough from the pin, draping it gently so you can center
it without stretching. Lift the outer edges of the dough to
give you enough slack to line the sides of the pan without
stretching the dough. Gently press the dough onto the
bottom and sides of the pan. Trim the excess from the rim
and press against the sides so the edges of the crust are
neat and tall. Chill for at least 30 minutes or up to
overnight.
(You can also wrap and freeze the crust for up to 1 month
and then bake it later . When it’s time to bake the crust,
don’t thaw it. Instead, just add a few minutes to the baking
time.)
Heat the oven to 400°F/200°C/gas 6. If you have a heavy
baking sheet, put it in the oven to heat, too; this will help
the underside of the crust to brown.
Line the chilled tart crust with parchment paper or
aluminum foil and ﬁll it with pie weights or dried beans.
Place on the heated baking sheet (if using) and bake until
the edges seem ﬁrm, slightly dry , and are beginning to
color (but don’t let the crust actually brown), about 10
minutes.
Remove the tart pan from the oven and remove the pie
weights and the parchment. Reduce the oven temperature
to 325°F/165°C/gas 3 and return the crust to the oven.
Bake until the center of the crust looks dry , about 10
minutes more. Let cool completely on a rack while you
