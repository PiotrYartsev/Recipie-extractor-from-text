them to brown. R aise the heat to medium-high and add the
tomatoes and rosemary . Smash the tomatoes with a wooden
spoon to collapse them into a pulp and then cook, stirring
constantly , until the tomatoes are thick and starting to stick
and brown on the bottom of the pan, 3 to 4 minutes.
Add the wine, vinegar , and W orcestershire sauce, bring to a
boil, and boil until the mixture is very thick and reduced to
the consistency of tomato jam, about 10 minutes. Stir in the
sugar and 1/4 tsp salt.
Add the butter and start stirring it around in circles with a
whisk, a fork, a wooden spoon, or anything that lets you
“stab” the hunk of butter so that you can move it around
easily . The butter will start to melt and the mixture will
bubble and boil around the edges. The melted butter
should look creamy , rather than melted and oily . Keep
stirring and blending until almost all of the butter is
incorporated, then remove the pan from the heat as you
work in the last bit.
Strain the sauce through a ﬁne-mesh sieve, pushing on the
tomatoes to squeeze out all of the juice. T aste and adjust
the seasoning with salt if needed. If the sauce is still very
sharp, whisk in another 1/2 tbsp cold butter . If it’s ﬂat, add
a drop or two of vinegar . If possible, serve right away .
STORAGE  To keep the sauce war m, hold it in the saucepan
for a few minutes. F or longer k eeping, transfer it to a bowl
set over a saucepan of hot water (the water should be no
hotter than 110°F/43°C). Y ou can also k eep the sauce in a
thermos for up to 2 hours. The sauce cannot be stor ed in
the refrigerator, as it will separate when r eheated.
QUICK CHANGE  Substitute 1 tbsp minced, seeded fr esh
hot chile for the shallot.
