water . Put the egg yolks, lemon juice, water , and 1/4 tsp salt
in the bowl and start whisking. As the bowl heats up, the
yolks will begin to thicken. Whisk vigorously , scraping
around the bowl with a heat-resistant rubber spatula from
time to time so that bits of yolk don’t get stuck to the sides
and overcook. Beat until thick and frothy but not quite
ﬂuﬀy , 3 to 4 minutes. The whisk will start leaving a clear
space on the bottom of the bowl. Remove the bowl from the
heat and whisk for another 30 seconds or so to stabilize the
sauce and let the bowl cool down.
Continue whisking as you slowly drizzle in the warm melted
butter , taking care not to add too much of the milky-watery
layer from the bottom of the pan. As you pour and whisk,
make sure the yolks are accepting the butter and the yolks
and butter are emulsifying. If the sauce looks at all broken
or “curdly ,” stop adding butter and just whisk for a few
seconds. Only resume adding butter once you’ve whisked
the sauce into creaminess again.
Once all of the butter has been added, whisk in the lemon
zest. T aste and adjust the seasoning with salt and lemon
juice if needed. If possible, serve right away .
