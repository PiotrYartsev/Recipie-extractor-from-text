1/4 cup/60 ml sour cr eam
In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine both sugars, the
corn syrup, butter , both chocolates, water , and salt and
bring to a boil over medium-high heat. As the mixture
heats, stir occasionally to encourage everything to melt and
blend together .
Reduce the heat until the sauce is at a simmer (if the heat
is too high, you could scorch the chocolate along the sides
of the pan) and simmer , stirring frequently , until very
glossy and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove the
pan from the heat and let the sauce cool down brieï¬‚y , then
stir or whisk in the sour cream. Serve hot, warm, or at
room temperature.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1
month or fr eeze for up to 3 months. If making the sauce
ahead, very gently r eheat it in a saucepan to loosen it up,
adding 2 to 3 tsp very hot water if needed to thin it out.
QUICK CHANGE  Add 1/2 tsp pur e pepper mint e xtract with
the sour cr eam.
