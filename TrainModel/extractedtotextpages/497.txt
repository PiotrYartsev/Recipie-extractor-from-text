The Really UsefUl InfoRmaTIon 509Problem solving
Pasta stuck together? Cooked pasta that is really stuck together is best kept for a baked 
pasta dish. Cool the pasta, then mix with sauce, vegetables or tinned tuna and cheese, and place in a hot oven for 30 minutes. 
Pastry 
Bought pastry, although handy, will never match the quality of rich, fresh homemade pastry: mass-produced commerical pastry is made in bulk using a rolling machine and inferior fats, and pastry made at home with butter and in small batches will always be tastier. See Pastry recipes.TiPs:
* Always chill raw pastry for 30 minutes before rolling it out, then for another 20–30 
minutes before putting it in the oven. This allows the gluten in the flour to relax, preventing unnecessary shrinkage while baking. 
* Pastry rolled out on marble is significantly better than other surfaces due to the 
marble’s capacity to absorb heat. This keeps the butter or fats within the pastry cool and workable. 
* Transferring pastry from the workbench to the tart tin or pie dish can be the cause of 
much frustration. Work quickly and confidently. The longer you work it, the warmer it gets, becoming soft and unmanageable. This is especially true of shortcrust or sweet pastries. Here are two methods:
1 Quickly roll out the dough between layers of plastic wrap. Ensure the plastic wrap is wide 
enough that the pastry won’t spill out the sides. Then remove the top layer of plastic, pick up the bottom piece with the pastry stuck to it and transfer to the pie dish.2 Roll out the dough on a work bench, dust lightly with flour, fold into quarters, transfer to the dish with the point of the fold in the centre of the dish, then simply unfold.
* Brush a little water around the top edge of the pie base before covering with the pastry 
lid. This helps strengthen the seal when the two are crimped together. 
* Once the dough or pastry has been moulded into the tin or dish, allow it to rest in the 
fridge for at least 20 minutes before baking.
* For a glossy pie crust, brush with egg white before baking. Puff pastry, whether bought 
or homemade, should be glazed carefully before baking for the best presentation.
* Splashing milk or egg wash over the outer cut edges of the pastry will act as a glue and 
retard the rising of the pastry when baked.
* Get into the habit of placing a tray or large baking dish in the oven under the pie to 
catch spillage.
Cooking P asTry
Blind baking pastry is the technique of partially cooking the pastry case before the filling 
is put in it. This ensures that the pastry is cooked through and that it is crisp, so it doesn’t get soggy when the filling is added. (It is particularly useful for wet fillings.) To prevent steam building up under the pastry, causing it to bubble, the uncooked pastry is weighed down in the dish or pricked all over before baking. To blind bake, cover the pastry case with a sheet of baking paper, then scatter rice, dried beans or pie weights on top.
