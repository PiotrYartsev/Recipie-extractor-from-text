Unlike a starch-thickened gravy , a jus is thickened only by
reduction and/or whisking in some cream or butter to
ﬁnish, and generally it is so intense that you drizzle only a
small amount onto your food—no mashed-potato swimming
pools full of jus. I like to make a jus from a roast chicken or
pork loin, for example, when my accompanying dishes don’t
include potatoes. A drizzle of jus from a lemony roast
chicken or rosemary-scented pork loin can unite your roast
and your side dishes and add a note of polish to the meal.
Many of the elements of a jus are the same as they are for a
gravy , including the pan, the aromatics, the liquids, and the
pan juices, so you should review that information on page
162. T wo elements are diﬀerent: THE F AT Because you are
not making a roux for thickening, you don’t need extra fat
in a jus. In fact, you want the jus to be as clean and fat free
as possible, other than the butter or cream you might
choose to add as a ﬁnish. So you must separate all of the
fat from the drippings, perhaps saving it to use for cooking
other dishes later , such as potatoes or beans.
THE THICKENER  Because by deﬁnition a jus is not
thickened, you do not need any ﬂour , cornstarch, or other
thickener .
THE METHOD
Read through the gravy method  and the modiﬁcations
below a few times before you start to make a jus.
Follow steps 1 through 3 for making gravy , then skip step 4,
which directs you to add fat and ﬂour .
Follow step 5, but just add the broth without worrying
about lumps, because there is no ﬂour to get lumpy .
