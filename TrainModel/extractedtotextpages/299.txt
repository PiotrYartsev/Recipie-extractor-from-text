little hot milk or cream into them (so they don’t overcook or
cook too quickly). The hot liquid helps the egg proteins
start to relax and uncoil, which is the ﬁrst phase of
thickening.
The second step is to add the tempered mixture back to the
hot liquid and then slowly cook it together over low heat
until thickened. The slower you cook the sauce, the more
control you have and the better the ﬁnal texture will be.
Higher heat causes the egg proteins to grab one another
and squeeze too tightly , which will take your sauce down
the path of curdling.
You also need to stir almost constantly to ensure the sauce
doesn’t thicken unevenly along the bottom and at the edges
of the pan. And custards thicken as they cool, so you have
to stop cooking them before you reach the desired
consistency .
You can test the doneness three diﬀerent ways. Y ou can
take the temperature of the sauce. A sauce that registers
180°F/82°C on an instant-read thermometer has the
thickness and consistency that I like. Or , use the “swipe”
test: dip a wooden spoon or heat-resistant rubber spatula
into the sauce, swipe your ﬁnger across the back of the
spoon or one side of the spatula, and if your ﬁnger leaves a
clear trail that doesn’t ﬁll in right away , the custard is
ready .
With experience, you’ll come to use the third testing
method, which is to observe the way the sauce sloshes in
the pan. As the sauce thickens, the movement will shift
from loose and liquidy to a ﬂow that just feels more
languid. It’s hard to describe, but pay attention as you use
the other two methods for judging doneness and soon you’ll
