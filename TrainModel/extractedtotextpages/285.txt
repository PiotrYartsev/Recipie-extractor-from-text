MAKES 1 1/4 CUPS/300 ML
This sauce is perfect for whipping up on the spur of the
moment for guests. I mean, you always have eggs and
sugar in the kitchen, right? And a search through your
cupboard where those rarely drunk spirits hang out is sure
to yield something usable. Be sure to taste the wine or
spirit ﬁrst to determine how sweet it is and then adjust
your sugar up or down accordingly .
4 egg yolks
1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp/65 g granulated sugar
1/3 cup/75 ml sweet fortiﬁed wine such as Marsala, Madeira,
or port
Pour water to a depth of 1 to 2 in/2.5 to 5 cm into a medium
saucepan and place over medium heat. Rest a medium
stainlesssteel bowl in the pan over (not touching) the water .
Put the egg yolks and sugar in the bowl and, using a whisk
or a handheld electric mixer on medium-high speed, begin
beating together the yolks and sugar . After about 1 minute,
add the wine and continue beating. As the bowl heats up,
the yolks will begin to thicken. Beat vigorously , scraping
around the bowl with a heat-resistant rubber spatula from
time to time so that bits of yolk don’t get stuck and
overcook. Beat until thick and frothy but not quite ﬂuﬀy , 8
