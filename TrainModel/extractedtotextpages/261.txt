I’m deﬁning gravy as a sauce made from pan drippings, fat
from the main ingredient, a thickener such as ﬂour , and
liquid, with the thickening the deﬁning feature. Gravies
accompany big roasted things, such as an Easter leg of
lamb, Thanksgiving turkey , Christmas roast beef—meat or
poultry that is in the oven long enough to give oﬀ ﬂavorful
juices that become more so as they roast in the bottom of
the pan. The word gravy can seem down-market, like what
might be congealed on a blue-plate special in a diner . But a
well-made gravy fashioned from roast turkey or roast beef
drippings can be as exquisite as any demi-glace sauce at a
restaurant. A t the same time, it is satisfyingly familiar and
comforting in its simplicity .
GRAVY COMPONENTS
The components are essentially the same whether you’re
roasting a chicken, turkey , pork loin, sirloin roast, or leg of
lamb. Read through each step carefully so that you are
familiar with all the “moving parts” of a gravy and can
more easily make judgments about them while you’re
cooking. All of the sauces in this chapter have an element
of urgency to them, though with a gravy you need to let
your roast rest anyway , which gives you a comfortable
window in which to perform the alchemy .
THE ROASTING P AN Ideally , a roasting pan is heavy and
not nonstick. It should also not be so large that there’s a
big area of exposed surface around whatever you’re
roasting where juices can evaporate too quickly or burn. If
the only pan you have is too big, surround whatever you’re
cooking with some onion, carrot, celery , fennel, or other
aromatic vegetable that will complement the gravy and will
