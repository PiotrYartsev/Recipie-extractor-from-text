Prepare a medium ﬁre in a charcoal or gas grill. The ﬁre is
ready when you can comfortably hold your hand, palm-side
down, 2 to 3 in/5 to 7.5 cm above the grill rack for 4
seconds. Brush the grill rack so that it is perfectly clean.
Using a vegetable peeler or a sharp paring knife, peel
strips of skin lengthwise oﬀ the eggplant to cover it
completely in vertical stripes. This eliminates much of the
can-be-tough skin but leaves enough to keep your slices
intact. Now cut the eggplant crosswise into rounds 1/2 in/12
mm thick.
Brush both sides of each slice with the oil and season with
salt.
Place the eggplant slices on the grill rack and grill, turning
once, until nicely grill marked on both sides and tender , 3
to 4 minutes per side. Pile the slices on a plate, cover with
aluminum foil, and leave to steam and ﬁnish cooking for
another 15 minutes. This will create the creamy texture you
want.
If using the medium tomatoes, core them and then cut into
very thin slices. Spread them out on a plate, season lightly
with salt, and let some of the juices drain oﬀ so they won’t
make the eggplant slices soggy , about 10 minutes. If using
cherry tomatoes, remove the stems and quarter the
tomatoes lengthwise. Put them in a colander or sieve, salt
them lightly , and let them drain for about 10 minutes.
Arrange the eggplant slices on a platter , overlapping them
slightly . Spread some of the sauce on each slice, lay a thin
tomato slice or a big pinch of tomato pieces on top, then
ﬁnish with crumbled feta and with a little parsley (if using).
Serve cool or at room temperature. The dish can also be
