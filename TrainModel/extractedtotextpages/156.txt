 
LEMON-CAPER BUTTER SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 1/2 CUP/120 ML
I only need to read the name of this sauce and I see the
ﬁllets of sole in the hot sauté pan, delicate and golden
around the edges, the perfect sweet partner for this zesty
but elegant sauce. Or , to make a slightly lighter dish, I
might cook the sole en papillote —seasoned with salt and
pepper , wrapped in parchment (or aluminum foil, let’s
make things easy), and baked with no added fat. Bake the
packets on a large rimmed baking sheet in a
400°F/200°C/gas 6 oven for 5 to 8 minutes, depending on
the thickness of the ﬁsh. It’s so simple and delicious. The
sauce is also excellent on braised or grilled leeks, or as a
dipping sauce for steamed artichoke.
