overwork the mixture. Shape the mixture into 24 uniform
meatballs, shaping them between your palms.
In a large frying pan, heat 2 tbsp of the oil over medium
heat. W orking in batches if necessary , add the meatballs in
a single layer , leaving enough room between them so you
can turn them easily . Brown the meatballs, turning them as
needed, until nicely colored on all sides, 7 to 9 minutes
total per batch. They may not be fully cooked through,
which is okay . Because of the cheese, the meatballs may
stick a little, so use a thin metal spatula to dislodge them
gently when you turn them. Transfer the meatballs to a
large plate.
Pour oﬀ any excess fat from the pan. If there are any
burned bits in the pan, wipe them out, but don’t wipe out
the good brown bits. Return the meatballs to the pan over
low heat, pour in the sauce, and gently simmer the
meatballs in the sauce, shaking the pan occasionally to coat
them well, until cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove
from the heat and keep warm.
Heat a large saucepan or frying pan over high heat and
drop in about half of the greens. (Y ou do not need to add
any water; the rinsing water clinging to greens is suﬀicient
moisture.) T oss the greens with tongs to encourage them to
wilt, and keep adding more greens as each batch collapses
and creates space in the pan. When all of the greens are in
the pan, season them with 1/2 tsp salt, reduce the heat to
medium, and cover the pan to steam the greens,
uncovering the pan and tossing the greens frequently as
they cook. If they seem to be drying out, add a few
spoonfuls of water . Cook just until tender , 3 to 10 minutes,
depending on the kind of greens you are using. T aste and
adjust the seasoning with salt; keep warm.
