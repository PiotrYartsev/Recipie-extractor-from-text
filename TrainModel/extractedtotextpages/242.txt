Although a hollandaise sauce is lofty and delicate, it does
have the ability to hold nicely for an hour or so if you leave
it in the double boiler over very low heat, or if you pour it
into a large thermos. When I have leftover hollandaise, I
like to use it as part of a topping for toasted crostini
because it’s delicious and browns beautifully under the
broiler . Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up
to 3 days.
BLENDER HOLLANDAISE, PERHAPS
Making hollandaise in a blender is a quick way to get
where you’re going. Y ou put the egg yolks and lemon
juice in the blender , and then you slowly pour in the hot
melted butter as the blender blades whirl. The advantage
of this method is that by not cooking the egg yolks on the
stove top, you don’t run the risk of overcooking them.
The merit in this method is its quickness, but I’ve never
gotten results that rival a handmade hollandaise. The
consistency always seems runny to me, and I don’t think
it’s that hard to whisk egg yolks in a double boiler .
A compromise position could be to use a handheld mixer
to whisk your yolks and butter in the double boiler ,
sparing yourself some of the elbow grease but still
properly cooking the yolks and getting that iconic light,
ﬂuﬀy texture.
