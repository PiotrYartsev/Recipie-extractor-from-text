heat slowly cooks the yolks, they thicken and trap the air
bubbles that you are incorporating with your vigorous
whisking. The process should proceed at a pace that allows
you to whisk in lots of air before the yolks are cooked to the
point where they won’t expand any more. If the heat is too
low, your mixture will never thicken. And while the sugar
and wine provide a certain amount of protection for the
yolks, if the heat is too high, the yolks risk setting before
they are at their loftiest. In the worst case, they’ll
”scramble.”
WHAT CAN GO WRONG AND HOW CAN I
FIX IT?
If you ﬁnd yourself with a sabayon that’s too runny but
you’ve already taken it oﬀ the heat, the best thing to do is
fold in some ﬁrm whipped cream and pretend you wanted
this style of sauce all along. I’ve never had success trying
to recook a loose sabayon. If your problem is an overcooked
sabayon with bits of cooked yolk in it, you can push it
through a ﬁne-mesh sieve, though you will lose some
volume doing that. Y ou may want to boost it with some
whipped cream, too .
HOW MUCH SAUCE PER SERVING?
Sabayons are rich but they’re also quite airy , so an average
serving might be 2 to 3 tablespoons per person, and a bit
more for sauces that have been enriched with whipped
cream.
