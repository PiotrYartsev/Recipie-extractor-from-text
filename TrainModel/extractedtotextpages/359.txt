transformed into complex caramel. But in the case of
milk caramels, the natural milk sugars add their ﬂavors
as well. These sauces have a soft, dairy deliciousness all
their own, but they are time-consuming and I don’t ﬁnd
myself making them often.
The other way to get a sauce with deep caramel tones is
to fake it: simmer together brown sugar , butter , and
cream and you’ve got a caramel-like sauce closer to
toﬀee than caramel. I like the toﬀee ﬂavors you get in
these sauces, so I’m including two recipes in this chapter .
Don’t try to caramelize brown sugar on its own, however .
It contains molasses, which will burn before the sugar
toasts.
