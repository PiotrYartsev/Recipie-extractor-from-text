Have ready six parfait glasses or wineglasses.
Set aside about 1/2 cup/120 ml of the sauce. Scrape the
remaining sauce into a food processor and pulse until the
berries are crushed. (I like to leave some texture to the
berries, but you can pulse until smooth, too .)
In a large bowl, using a handheld electric mixer , beat
together the cream, goat cheese, sugar , and salt on
medium-low speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Increase
the speed to high and beat until ﬁrm peaks form when the
beaters are lifted (don’t forget to stop the mixer before
lifting), about 2 minutes. Add the reserved sauce and the
processed sauce and, using a rubber spatula, fold just until
blended. (The mixture can be covered and refrigerated for
up to 1 day before continuing.)
Spoon about 3 1/2 tbsp of the cream mixture into each glass.
Top with about 3 tbsp of the cookie crumbs. Spread about
31/2 tbsp of the cream mixture over the cookie crumbs in
each glass. T op with the remaining crumbs and then with
the remaining cream mixture.
Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate up to 3 hours
(the cookie crumbs will soften a bit). T op with the
strawberry halves just before serving.
