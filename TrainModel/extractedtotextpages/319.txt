SPECIAL EQUIPMENT
Depending on the sauce you’re making, a blender or food
processor comes in handy . Also, a heavy saucepan, a ﬁne-
mesh sieve, and a ﬂexible but strong rubber spatula to
push the sauce through the sieve are all good to have on
hand.
STORAGE
Most fruit sauces can be stored in airtight containers in the
refrigerator for up to 5 days, though the brightness of any
sauce will fade after a day or two . They can also be frozen
for up to 2 months, again with some diminished brightness.
