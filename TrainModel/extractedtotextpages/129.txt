 
ROASTED GREEN CHILE AND TOMATILLO
SAUCE WITH AVOCADO
MAKES 4 CUPS/960 ML
My friend and great cook Gilberto Martin del Campo
showed me how to make this brightly ﬂavored, pretty green
sauce. It’s so easy to whip up and so much better than any
commercial salsa verde. Use it on melty-cheesy nachos, on
scrambled eggs with feta cheese, and as a base for a pork
and green chile stew (though save the avocado to use as a
garnish, not in the sauce).
3 to 4 jalapeño chiles, stemmed and seeded
1 poblano chile, stemmed and seeded
1 lb/455 g tomatillos, papery husks r emoved, rinsed, and
halved
1 yellow onion, thickly sliced

Kosher salt
1 small ripe avocado, halved, pitted, peeled, and ﬁnely
diced
