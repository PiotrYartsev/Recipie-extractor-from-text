In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
Don’t stir as it melts. Y ou want the milky solids to fall to the
bottom and the butterfat to ﬂoat to the top. K eep warm.
Pour water to a depth of 1 to 2 in/2.5 to 5 cm into a medium
saucepan and place over medium heat. Rest a medium
stainless-steel bowl in the pan over (not touching) the
water . Put the egg yolks, vinegar reduction, and 1/4 tsp salt
in the bowl and start whisking. As the bowl heats up, the
yolks will thicken. Whisk vigorously , scraping around the
bowl with a heat-resistant rubber spatula from time to time
so that bits of yolk don’t get stuck and overcook. Beat until
thick and frothy but not ﬂuﬀy , 3 to 4 minutes. The whisk
will start leaving a clear space on the bottom of the bowl.
Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk for another 30
seconds to stabilize the sauce and let the bowl cool down.
Continue whisking as you slowly drizzle in the melted
butter , taking care not to add too much of the milky-watery
layer . As you pour and whisk, make sure the yolks are
accepting the butter and the yolks and butter are
emulsifying. If the sauce looks broken or “curdly ,” stop
adding butter and whisk for a few seconds. Resume adding
butter once you’ve whisked the sauce into creaminess
again.
Once all of the butter has been added, whisk in the
chopped tarragon. Season with salt, pepper , and with more
tarragon if needed. If possible, serve right away .
