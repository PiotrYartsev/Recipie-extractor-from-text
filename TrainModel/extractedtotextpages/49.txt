Make it easier:  
Tackle this recipe in 
stages. The soup can 
keep for up to 1 week 
in the refrigerator, or 
up to 3 months in the 
freezer. You can also 
prepare the filling up 
to 2 days ahead.5. Cut the jellied stock into 1/8-inch cubes. Scoop out one-third 
of the cubes into a bowl and set aside. Mix the remaining 
cubes into the filling. Cover and refrigerate while you roll the 
dough, or up to 2 days.
6. Roll out the wrappers and fold the dumplings: Cut the 
dough into 24 pieces (see page 24). Roll each piece into a 
4-inch circle about 1/16 inch thick around the edges. Keep 
covered.
7. Lay 6 wrappers on a cutting board and place 1 tablespoon 
of filling in the center of each and use a spoon to flatten it 
slightly. Place 1 reserved cube of stock jelly on top of the 
filling.
8. Fold the dumplings using the Soup Dumpling Fold (see page 
30). Repeat with the remaining wrappers, filling, and stock.
9. Cook and serve: In a 10-inch-wide stockpot or wok, bring 
3 cups water to a boil. Line the bottom of two steamer 
baskets with the cabbage leaves and steam for 2 minutes, or 
until the cabbage is softened.
10. Arrange 12 dumplings in each basket, making sure they are 
not touching. Stack the baskets over the pot and reduce 
the heat to medium to keep a simmer. Steam for 10 to 
12 minutes, or until the dumpling skins look dry on the sur -
face and slightly droopy.
11. Remove from the heat and serve the dumplings directly from 
the baskets with the dipping sauce on the side.  Be careful 
not to break the dumplings, or the soup will run out before 
you can enjoy it! Use caution when eatingâ€”the soup inside 
is boiling hot, so serve each dumpling in a large spoon and 
gently blow on it to cool before eating.
