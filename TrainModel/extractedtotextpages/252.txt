 
BÉARNAISE SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 1 CUP/240 ML
Béarnaise is a close relative of hollandaise, but it includes
very French ingredients such as tarragon, wine, and
shallot. Be sure to chop tarragon with a very sharp knife, as
it bruises easily . Béarnaise is classically paired with steak,
but it’s also marvelous with salmon, crab cakes, and even
plain-Jane chicken breasts.
1/4 cup/60 ml white wine vinegar
1/4 cup/60 ml dry white wine
1 tbsp minced shallot or yellow onion
1 fresh tar ragon sprig, plus 1 tbsp ﬁnely chopped leaves,
plus mor e if needed
2/3 to 3/4 cup/140 to 170 g unsalted butter
2 egg yolks
Kosher salt and fr eshly gr ound black pepper
In a small saucepan. combine the vinegar , wine, shallot,
and tarragon sprig and bring to a boil over medium-high
heat. Boil until reduced to about 1 tbsp, 7 to 9 minutes.
Strain through a ﬁne-mesh sieve into a medium bowl,
pressing on the herbs and shallot with a rubber spatula to
squeeze out all of the ﬂavor .
