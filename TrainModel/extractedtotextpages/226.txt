may need to stop and scrape again. As the mayonnaise gets
thicker , you can add the oil faster . When you have
incorporated almost all of the oil, slow down and watch the
sauce closely . If you see oil starting to separate out, stop
adding oil; the yolks have absorbed enough.
When all of the oil is incorporated, add the avocado, a few
chunks at a time, processing until the mayonnaise is
smooth and light. Whirl in the lime zest. T aste and adjust
the seasoning with salt and lime juice if needed.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5
days.
QUICK CHANGE  Add 2 tbsp chopped canned mild gr een
chiles and 1/4 cup/10 g chopped fr esh cilantr o with the last
of the avocado chunks.
