 
MANGO-MINT COULIS
MAKES 1 CUP/240 ML
It doesn’t take much to turn a ripe mango into a glorious
sauce, but here I’m infusing the sauce with fresh mint to
add an herbal note that makes mango even more delicious.
A touch of lime balances out the brightness of the fruit.
The only mangoes I eat are the small, golden A taulfo
mangoes, also called Manila or Champagne mangoes.
They’re virtually ﬁber free, so each chunk of ﬂesh is juicy ,
dense, and smooth, and the ﬂavor is sprightly and
perfumed. If you can’t ﬁnd fresh A taulfo mangoes, frozen
mango chunks will work in a pinch. This sauce is beautiful
spooned around a slice of fresh fruit tart or grilled
pineapple slices, and it’s stunning on a creamy meringue
Pavlova .
