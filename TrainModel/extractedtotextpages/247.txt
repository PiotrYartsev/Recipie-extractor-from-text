 
“STEAK SAUCE” HOLLANDAISE
MAKES ABOUT 1 CUP/240 ML
I wanted to pump up the umami ﬂavor of my classic
hollandaise, so I added soy sauce, W orcestershire, and
sherry vinegar . If I had pan drippings from a roast beef , I
would whisk them in, too . I pair this with steak and garlicky
fried potatoes .
3/4 cup/170 g unsalted butter
1 tsp soy sauce
1 tsp W orcestershir e sauce
Hot-pepper sauce such as Sriracha
2 egg yolks
1 tbsp sher ry vinegar, plus mor e if needed
1 tbsp water
Kosher salt
1/2 tsp lightly pack ed ﬁnely grated lemon zest
In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
Don’t stir as it melts. Y ou want the milky solids to fall to the
bottom and the butterfat to ﬂoat to the top. K eep warm.
In a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, W orcestershire
sauce, and a few dashes of hot-pepper sauce; set aside.
