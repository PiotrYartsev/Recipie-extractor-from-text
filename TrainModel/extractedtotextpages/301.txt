As with so many good things in cooking, custards require a
heavy saucepan. Traditionally , you use a wooden spoon to
stir custards and to test the thickness, but I prefer a heat-
resistant rubber spatula, which scrapes the pan beautifully .
An instant-read thermometer can help you ﬁnd the sweet
spot, but it is not obligatory . A ﬁne-mesh sieve is good for
straining.
STORAGE
I like to eat my custard sauces cool, not warm, so I make
them at least several hours or up to a day ahead of when I
plan to serve them. I ﬁnd that the ﬂavors mature with time,
too, so making these kinds of sauces ahead is deﬁnitely
recommended. But don’t make them too far ahead.
Custards get funky after about 5 days, and they don’t
freeze well, unless you actually churn them into an ice
cream.
DON’T LET THE SUGAR “COOK” THE YOLKS
Before you cook a custard sauce, you whisk together the
egg yolks and sugar . But you have to combine them
immediately—no dumping the sugar and yolks into a bowl
and leaving them to sit for a few minutes while you do
something else. That’s because the sugar is hygroscopic,
meaning it pulls moisture from nearby ingredients, in this
case the yolks. It’s like cooking the yolks without heat,
and it leaves behind little dry bits of yolk that will make
your sauce lumpy .
