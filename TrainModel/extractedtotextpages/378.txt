Position one rack in the upper third and a second rack in
the lower third of the oven and heat to 375°F/190°C/gas 5.
Spread the pecans in a single layer on a large rimmed
baking sheet and toast in the oven on either rack until
fragrant and a shade or two darker—but not burnt!—about
8 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool, and then transfer to
a food processor and pulse until ﬁnely chopped. Reduce the
oven temperature to 325°F/165°C/gas 3.
In a stand mixer ﬁtted with the paddle attachment, or in a
large bowl with a handheld electric mixer , beat together
the butter , both sugars, and salt on medium-high speed
until well blended but not ﬂuﬀy (you don’t want to beat a
lot of air into the dough), about 1 minute. On low speed,
add the ﬂour and beat just until the ﬂour is incorporated.
Add the pecans and mix just until combined. Do not
overbeat the dough or you won’t get the meltingly tender
texture you want.
If the cookie dough is too soft to roll out, chill it for a few
minutes until it is ﬁrm. Divide the dough in half . On a
lightly ﬂoured work surface, roll out half of the dough into
a round 1/4 in/6 mm thick. Using a 1 1/2-in/4-cm round
cookie cutter , cut out as many cookies as possible. Arrange
the cookies on a large ungreased baking sheet, spacing
them at least 1 in/2.5 cm apart. Gently press the dough
scraps together , reroll, and cut out more cookies. Repeat
with the remaining half of the dough.
Bake the cookies until just slightly browned around the
edges and on the bottom, dry on top, and not doughy in the
center when you break one open, 12 to 15 minutes.
Transfer the cookies to racks and let cool completely .
STORAGE  The cookies will k eep in an airtight container at
room temperatur e for up to 1 week.
