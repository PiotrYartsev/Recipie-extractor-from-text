Just one whiff of this cucumber salad mixed with sesame oil and cilantro gets my mouth 
watering, and I’m instantly hungry. It’s a great summer salad when you want something 
crunchy and refreshing. It pairs beautifully alongside dumplings like Spicy Shrimp Dump -
lings (page 47) and Xiao Long Bao (page 52).
2 English cucumbers
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 tablespoon sesame oil
3 teaspoons sesame seeds, 
toasted, divided
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 teaspoons light soy sauce
1 teaspoon Chili Crisp 
Sauce (page 99)
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 cup roughly chopped 
fresh cilantro
Cooking tiP: This salad is 
best served immediately, but 
you can let it marinate for up 
to 30 minutes before serving.1. Lay one cucumber on a clean cutting board. Place 
the flat side of a cleaver or kitchen knife on the 
cucumber and pound your fist down the length of 
the knife, until the cucumber is flattened and split. 
Repeat with the second cucumber. Cut the cucum-
bers crosswise into 1-inch chunks and transfer to a 
medium bowl.
2. In a small bowl, whisk the vinegar, sesame oil, 
2 teaspoons of sesame seeds, garlic, soy sauce, chili 
crisp sauce, and sugar to blend. Pour the mixture 
over the cucumbers,  add the cilantro, and toss to 
coat. Garnish with the remaining 1 teaspoon of 
sesame seeds to serve.
