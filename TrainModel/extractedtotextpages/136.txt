Trim oﬀ the roots and dark green tops of the leeks. Split
the leeks in half lengthwise and rinse very well, separating
the leaves to wash away the grit hiding between them. Cut
the leeks crosswise into slices 1/4 in/6 mm thick.
In a large frying pan, melt the butter with the oil over
medium heat. Add the leeks and season lightly with salt
and pepper . Add the thyme sprig, cover , and cook, stirring
and scraping the bottom of the pan often so the juices don’t
burn, until the leeks are just tender , about 10 minutes.
Uncover , stir in the garlic, and continue cooking until the
leeks are very tender and the juices are just barely
browning on the bottom of the pan, 3 to 5 minutes more. If
the leeks look like they are at risk of burning or sticking,
add a few spoonfuls of water to loosen them. Remove from
the heat, remove and discard the thyme sprig, and let the
leek mixture cool completely .
Heat the oven to 400°F/200°C/gas 6. On a lightly ﬂoured
work surface, roll out the pastry into an 11-by-15-in/28-by-
38-cm rectangle. Cut the rectangle in half lengthwise so
you have two 5 1/2-by-15-in/14-by-38-cm rectangles. Slide
one rectangle onto a large rimless baking sheet and prick it
all over with a fork. Moisten the long edges with some
water and fold them over to create a 1/2-in/12-mm border .
Press ﬁrmly to secure the border .
Spread the pastry with half of the mustard, and then
spread half of the cooled leeks evenly on top. Crumble half
of the goat cheese evenly over the leeks. Repeat with the
remaining pastry rectangle, mustard, leeks, and goat
cheese and transfer to the baking sheet.
Bake until the pastry is puﬀed around the edges and deep
golden brown (lift up the edge to check the bottom), 22 to
