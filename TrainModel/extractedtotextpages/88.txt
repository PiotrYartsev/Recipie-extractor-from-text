serves  6 to 8 PreP  tiMe 15 minutes, plus overnight to pickle
When I was a kid, my granny came to stay with us for a visit. She liked pickled foods, so 
my mom made a huge jar of these pickled radishes. Granny ate them with everything, at 
every meal, and dipped into them as snacks throughout the day. This recipe works well with 
daikon radish and even carrot sticks.
12 to 15 red radishes, 
trimmed and quartered
3 fresh ginger slices, each 
about the size of a quar -
ter, peeled
2 garlic cloves, smashed
1 dried red chile
1 cup rice vinegar
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon kosher salt
Make it easier:Â If you want 
the pickled radishes sooner, 
thinly slice the radishes 
instead of quartering them and 
they should be ready by the 
time the pickling liquid is cool.1. In a clean 24-ounce glass jar, combine the radishes, 
ginger, garlic, and red chile.
2. In a small saucepan over high heat, combine the 
vinegar, sugar, 1/ 4 cup water, and the salt. Stir to dis-
solve the sugar and salt and bring to a boil. Remove 
from the heat and pour the pickling liquid into the jar 
to cover the radishes. Set aside for about 1 hour to 
cool to room temperature. Seal the jar and refriger -
ate overnight.
3. The pickles will be ready to eat the next day but will 
improve in flavor within 3 days. They will keep for up 
to 1 month in the refrigerator.
