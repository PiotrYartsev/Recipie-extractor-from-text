HINTS AND TIPS:

467* You will need— large bowl, 
spoon, weight and liquid 
measures, plastic wrap or tea towel, rolling pin and pizza tray or rectangular baking tray.
* Like most bread products, 
the best flour for the job is ‘strong’ flour— also known as 
‘bread’ flour. However, for most beginner cooks, plain flour is easily recognised and readily available and does a good job.
* If it is not to your 
liking the first time, do not despair— dough making is 
an art and over time can be refined until you get a feel for it. It can vary greatly depending on the consistency and age of the flour, the yeast and the temperature. Once you start, the quest for the perfect crust is on.
* If it is cold and you need 
to find a warm spot, an old trick passed on to me by my wise Greek friend is to place the dough in bed with the electric blanket on. It sounds strange but it works!
* Not all pizzas are round; 
you can make long rectangular ones or mini pizzas.
* If you will be making 
pizza often, it is worth investing in pizza trays or a pizza stone. Try and find pizza trays that are ‘matt’ grey or black as these absorb heat and make for a crispier base, whereas a shiny silver pizza tray reflects heat and the base of the pizza may not brown as well.
* Use the dough to make 
calzone; this is like an Italian pasty. Make a filling, spread a large mound of it along half of the rolled out round of pizza dough. Brush lightly whisked egg along the edges, fold over the other half and press the edges down firmly. Brush with more egg and bake in a 220°C oven until golden.
* Use the dough to make 
cheese twists.
* Substitute the dry yeast 
for live yeast which can be purchased from delis or bakeries.
* You may need to add a 
dusting of flour from time to time as you knead the dough to reduce stickiness.
* You will know when the 
dough is ready when it no longer sticks to your hands.
* The dough can be frozen 
for several months, but be mindful that it will continue rising for a little while before its temperature drops, so wrap it tightly or place in a clip lock bag. When using the dough, remove from the freezer and defrost in the fridge overnight. Then bring it back to room temperature before rolling out, otherwise the dough will tear.
