serves  4 to 6 PreP  tiMe 15 minutes, plus 30 minutes to chill Cook tiMe 10 minutes
This is a delicious and quick-to-prepare pantry dish. It’s a hit at parties and picnics. I like 
using chunky peanut butter for more texture, but use what you have. Although these noodles 
are best served cold, I will understand completely if you can’t wait that long and just eat 
them hot.
1 pound dried egg noodles
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1/2 cup peanut butter
2 tablespoons Chinese 
sesame paste
2 tablespoons light 
soy sauce
2 teaspoons rice vinegar
Pinch ground Sichuan  
pepper
1 small cucumber, peeled 
and cut into thin strips
3 scallions, white and green 
parts, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons roughly 
chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon sesame seeds, 
toasted 
Cooking tiP: If you can’t 
find Chinese sesame paste, stir 
together 11/2 tablespoons tahini 
with 2 teaspoons sesame oil 
instead.1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the noo-
dles according to the package instructions. Reserve 
1/ 4 cup of cooking water and drain the noodles. Rinse 
the noodles under cold water and drain completely. 
T ransfer to a bowl and toss with sesame oil to keep 
them from sticking. Chill in the refrigerator for 
30 minutes, or until cold.
