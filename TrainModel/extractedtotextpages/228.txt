2 tbsp cr ème fraîche (optional)
In a small saucepan, bring the broth to a simmer over
medium-high heat. Simmer until reduced to about 2 tbsp, 6
to 8 minutes. Set aside to cool completely .
Pour both oils into a measuring cup; set aside. In a food
processor , combine the egg yolks, vinegar , mustard, garlic,
and 1/2 tsp salt and pulse until well blended. The yolks will
likely be sprayed on the sides of the bowl, so scrape them
down with a rubber spatula. W ith the motor running, begin
adding the oil in a very slow stream. Y ou may need to stop
and scrape again. As the mayonnaise gets thicker , you can
add the oil faster . When you have incorporated almost all of
the oil, slow down and watch the sauce closely . If you see
oil starting to separate out, stop adding oil; the yolks have
absorbed enough.
With the motor running, add the tuna, anchovies, capers,
lemon juice, and reduced broth and process until quite
smooth. If using the crème fraîche, add to the mixture and
pulse to combine. T aste and adjust the seasoning with salt
and lemon juice if needed (if using canned broth, you
probably won’t need more salt).
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5
days.
QUICK CHANGE  Add 1/4 cup/10 g ﬁnely chopped tender
fresh herb such as ﬂat-leaf parsley, chervil, chives, dill,
basil, mint, or cilantr o, or a mixtur e, with the cr ème fraîche.
