Chilli heat ratings
Chilli heat is measured in Scoville heat units. The capsaicin is chemically extracted from 
the chilli and subjected to high performance liquid chromatography. Basically, these units represent the number of times the extracted capsaicin dissolved in alcohol can be diluted with a quantity of sugar water before the capsaicin can no longer be tasted.

ChoColate
Chocolate has a long history as a glamour food, the food of the gods. The very best 
chocolate fetches top dollar for its smooth texture and pure flavour, which unfortunately means that much of the chocolate we consume is often churned into cheap confectionery and crude compound cooking blocks
—sad, milk-laden versions of the good stuff. The good stuff 
displays its cocoa butter content proudly (from 33 per cent), and is a real treat to use and eat.
Store chocolate at room temperature (ideally at 20°C) in a cool, dry place, in its 
original wrapper or in foil. Dark chocolate has a shelf life of several years, while milk chocolate should be used within 12 months. Don’t store chocolate in the fridge or freezer, as it will have a greater tendency to bloom once thawed. (Bloom is the name given to the grey/white spots that appear on the surface of chocolate when the cocoa butter separates from the solids.) Why would you freeze it anyway? Eat it!
Chocolate is made from the cacao bean. The rarest cacao tree, whose bean is the most 
expensive and sought after by the world’s best chocolate makers, is the ‘criollo’ (which means ‘native’), although 90 per cent of the world’s production of cacao beans comes from the ‘forastero’ (translated as ‘foreigner’); ‘trinitario’ (‘third’) is a hybrid of the two.
The cacao bean is fermented then dried before being roasted and ground to form cocoa
