The Really UsefUl InfoRmaTIon 497Herbs
I will always encourage people to try growing fresh herbs at home, in the garden or in pots 
on the windowsill or balcony. If you opt for potted herbs, I recommend the following four as a starting combination: flat-leaf parsley, rosemary, basil and thyme. Tips:
* Wash herbs only just before using them, as excess water can be absorbed through the 
leaves, causing black, slimy spots. 
* Store fresh herbs from the market in a plastic bag with the stem end wrapped in wet paper 
towel. 
* If the herbs have been purchased with the root still intact, stand them in a small amount 
of cold water in the fridge, covered with a plastic bag. 
* As a general rule, add woodier herbs (rosemary, thyme) early in cooking and soft herbs 
(basil, mint) at the very end of cooking.
* Dried herbs certainly have their place in the kitchen, but when they’ve lost their punch, 
toss them out and start again: replace any not used within a year of purchase.
* When substituting dried herbs for fresh, use about half the amount the recipe calls for, 
as dried herbs contain concentrated oils: 1 teaspoon fresh herbs = ½ teaspoon dried. If 
you have dried your own recently, it may be wise to use only one-third of the dried herb compared to fresh, as the dried herb will still have quite a kick.

Leftover herbs? The best option is to avoid leftovers by planning a second recipe to use up 
the remainder of the bunch. However, there are many uses for leftovers:
* Dry your own—not all herbs enjoy being dried. The best are those that contain volatile 
oils: rosemary, marjoram, savory, bay and thyme. Either hang them over the stove area or place on a tray in a warm, dry area of the house. Once dry, store in airtight jars.
* Store in vinegar—softer herbs, like parsley, tarragon, basil, dill and mint, lose more 
in the drying process so a good option is to steep in vinegar, then splash a little on the dish instead of the fresh herb.
* Store herbs in oil—chop finely or crush in a mortar and pestle then mix with a little 
oil. Store in the fridge for several weeks with the layer of oil sitting on top. Ideal for basil, coriander and dill.
* Freeze—most herbs can be frozen, left intact on the branch. The less you handle them 
before freezing, the better chance they have in the freezer. Wash, pat dry carefully (so as not to bruise them and release their oils), then pack in plastic bags, removing as much air as possible before freezing. Remember not to overcrowd the bag and to keep it flat. When you need the herb, just snap off the amount required and cut while still frozen. Defrosting the herb will make it too wet to work with. Another way to freeze herbs is to puree with water then store in ice trays. The ice cubes of herbs can be stored in plastic bags and then used for soups, stews or sauces. 
* Make herb butter—chop and mix with softened butter, roll in foil and freeze for later 
use. Try on herb bread or take a slice to have with a steak.
