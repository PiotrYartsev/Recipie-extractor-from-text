in the sugar , espresso powder , cinnamon, vanilla, and
almond extract, ground chipotle, and salt. P our the cream
mixture over the chocolate. Leave undisturbed for about 1
minute to melt the chocolate, then start whisking in small
circles in the center of the bowl, widening your whisking
toward the outer edges of the bowl as the sauce becomes
glossy and smooth. If the sauce seems a little thick, whisk
in a few spoonfuls of very hot water to loosen it up. Serve
warm.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1
month or fr eeze for up to 3 months. If making the sauce
ahead, very gently r eheat it in a saucepan to loosen it up,
adding 2 to 3 tsp very hot water if needed to thin it out.
QUICK CHANGE  Add 1 tbsp K ahlúa or other coﬀee liqueur
to the cr eam as you heat it.
