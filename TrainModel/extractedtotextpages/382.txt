WHAT’S GOING ON IN THIS SAUCE?
For these sauces, you are essentially melting chocolate and
adding a liquid to thin it out and create a saucy consistency .
The liquid you add (water , cream, milk, spirits) and the
ﬂavorings you use (vanilla, citrus zest) will enhance the
chocolate ﬂavor , so you need to think about how your
ingredients play together . Here are the key players:
CHOCOLA TE Your ﬁnal sauce is only as good as the
chocolate you use, and a huge array of high-quality
chocolates is available these days. My low-end chocolate

Lindt Excellence Smooth Dark 70 percent cacao, two
brands that you can ﬁnd in most grocery stores for a decent
price. When I have the opportunity and the money , I will go

meal, I will use V alrhona or Michel Cluizel, two French
brands that oﬀer a range of single-origin chocolates, each

sharply acidic and citrusy . The best way to know which
brand you want to use is to taste the chocolates and
compare them—a tough assignment, I know .
LIQUID  When choosing which liquid to use in a sauce, I
ﬁrst decide which aspect of the chocolate I want to
emphasize. The deep, dark almost coﬀeelike side? In that
case, I will use water , and I may even make my sauce with
cocoa powder (see below), not chocolate. Or am I looking
for the creamy , suave, nuttier side of chocolate? That calls
for cream because its ﬂavor will temper some of the acidic
bite of chocolate and it will add its own luxurious texture.
COCOA  For the most chocolaty ﬂavor of all, skip the solid
chocolate and go straight for cocoa powder , which consists
