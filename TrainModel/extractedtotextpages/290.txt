medium-high speed, begin beating them together . After
about 1 minute, add the rum and continue beating. As the
bowl heats up, the yolks will begin to thicken. Beat
vigorously , scraping around the sides of the bowl with a
heat-resistant rubber spatula from time to time so that bits
of yolk don’t get stuck and overcook. Beat until thick and
frothy but not quite ﬂuﬀy , 8 to 10 minutes by hand or 4 to 5
minutes with the mixer . It is ready when it forms a thick
ribbon as it trails oﬀ the end of the whisk or beater .
Remove the bowl from the heat and beat for another 30
seconds or so to stabilize the sauce and let the bowl cool
down. If possible, serve right away .
STORAGE  The sabayon is best eaten right af ter you mak e
it, but you can hold the sauce in the double boiler over very
low heat for up to 30 minutes.
