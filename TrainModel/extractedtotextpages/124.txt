Transfer the potatoes to a food processor , add the garlic,
and pulse a few times. Then, with the motor running,
drizzle in the oil. (The sauce may look slightly curdled at
this point, but it will smooth out as you add cooking water
later.) Pulse as you add the lemon juice and lemon zest and
then add enough of the cooking water to give the sauce the
consistency of thin sour cream. Season generously with salt
and pepper .
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3
days. The sauce does not fr eeze well.
QUICK CHANGE  Add 1 tbsp fr esh dill with the lemon juice.
