Roasting pears enhances their
already soft and sweet
personality , and here I up the
ante by roasting them in a
buttery toﬀee sauce. Look for
ﬁrm pears so they won’t become
mushy in the heat of the oven. If
you don’t feel like roasting the
pears, you can simply serve
sliced pears with the sauce and
cookies.
3 large or 6 small (such as F orelle) ripe yet ﬁr m pears
2 tbsp unsalted butter
3/4 cup/180 ml Butter -Rum Toﬀee Sauce
1 pt/480 ml pr emium vanilla ice cr eam
Tiny P ecan Cookies
Heat the oven to 375°F/190°C/gas 5.
Peel the pears, halve lengthwise, and scoop out the core
and any tough ﬁbers (a melon baller does this beautifully).
In a large, ovenproof frying pan, melt the butter over
medium-high heat (use two pans if all of the pears won’t ﬁt
in a single layer). Arrange the pears, cut-side down, in the
pan, nestling them so they ﬁt together without crowding.
Sauté until the cut sides are golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes,
then carefully ﬂip the pears over .
Pour the toﬀee sauce over the pears, put the pan in the
oven, and roast until the pears are very tender , 15 to 20
