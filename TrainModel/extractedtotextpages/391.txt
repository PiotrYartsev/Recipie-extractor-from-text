using). Add the cream and bring just to a simmer; do not let
it boil. Remove from the heat.
Put the chocolate in a stainless-steel or other heatproof
bowl and set a ﬁne-mesh sieve over it. Strain the raspberry
cream through the sieve into the chocolate. Leave
undisturbed for about 1 minute to melt the chocolate, then
start whisking in small circles in the center of the bowl,
widening your whisking toward the outer edges of the bowl
as the sauce becomes glossy and smooth. T aste and add a
touch more sugar if needed. Serve warm or at room
temperature.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 2
weeks or fr eeze for up to 3 months. If making the sauce
ahead, very gently r eheat it in a saucepan to loosen it up,
adding 2 to 3 tsp very hot water if needed to thin it out.
QUICK CHANGE  Substitute 1/2 cup/120 ml passion fruit
purée for the raspber ries; you can skip the straining step.
