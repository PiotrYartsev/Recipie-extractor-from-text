The Basics: a really useful cookB ook 470Sugar Syrup
Makes approximately 350 ml
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
1 cup water
1 cup white sugar
 
* You will need— cup 
measures, saucepan and wooden 
spoon.
* The syrup, properly 
covered to prevent it from taking on odours, can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 12 months. Left at room temperature, sugar syrup can form mould so it is always recommended to store refrigerated.
* Sugar syrup is a 50/50 
combination of water and sugar. It can differ in density depending on the sugar to water ratio.
* It is good to have on hand 
because it lasts well and can be used in many recipes, for example baklava, syrup cakes or sorbet.* Add an extra ½ cup water 
to make a poaching syrup for fruit. If the fruit is quite tart, then leave the ratio at equal parts sugar to water. Flavour the poaching syrup by adding 30 ml (1 nip) liqueur or 
½ cinnamon stick or ½ 
vanilla bean. Other spices can also be used including black pepper, star anise or cardamom pods.
* Try adding a piece of 
lemon or orange zest to the sugar mixture before it boils. Keep the zest in the stored syrup to continue flavouring it. Use this lemon-flavoured syrup as a base for lemonade.
* Sugar syrup is frequently 
used in cocktails because it combines well with alcohol. One example is a French 75. Combine 15 ml each of gin, fresh lemon juice and sugar syrup in a champagne flute and top up with chilled sparking wine or French champagne.
* Sugar syrup is often 
referred to as a ‘simple syrup’ in cocktails, in the professional kitchen it is often known as a ‘stock syrup’.
* If you don’t have a sugar 
thermometer, you can test the stages of cooked sugar syrups using the iced water method, note the following:
* Soft ball— drops of syrup 
in chilled water will form a fudge-like ‘soft ball’ when rolled between the thumb and forefinger.
* Firm ball— drops of the 
syrup cooled in the iced water will produce a ‘firm ball’ ideal for making caramel.Method:
1. Pour the water into saucepan and add the sugar.2. allow the sugar to dissolve over medium heat, 
stirring occasionally.
3. once it comes to the boil, reduce to low heat and 
allow to simmer for 5 minutes, without stirring, to thicken slightly.
4. Pour into a sterilised bottle, cover and store in 
the refrigerator.
