4 oz/115 g dry -pack bay scallops or sea scallops
1 cup/240 ml Spicy Saﬀr on–R ed Pepper Cream Sauce
6 oz/180 g medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 tsp lightly pack ed ﬁnely grated lemon zest
2 tbsp ﬁnely chopped fr esh basil
2 tbsp k osher salt
6 oz/180 g farfalle pasta or similar pasta shapes
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. If using
sea scallops, cut away or pull oﬀ the tough muscle on the
side of each scallop and quarter the scallop.
While the water is heating, bring the cream sauce to a
gentle simmer , add the shrimp, and simmer for a minute or
so. Add the scallops and simmer until the shrimp and
scallops are cooked, 2 to 3 minutes longer , depending on
their size. K eep the sauce warm. In a small bowl, mix
together the lemon zest and basil.
When the water is boiling, add the salt and pasta, stir , and
cook until al dente, according to the package instructions.
Just before the pasta is ready , scoop out about 1 cup/240 ml
of the cooking water and set aside. Drain the pasta well
and return it to the pot.
Add the seafood sauce to the pasta and toss gently but
thoroughly to mix. If the mixture seems at all dry or
clumpy , add a few spoonfuls of the reserved cooking water ,
knowing that the pasta will continue to drink up sauce as it
sits.
Arrange a neat mound of pasta in each warmed bowl and
top with the zest-basil mixture, dividing it evenly . Serve
right away .
