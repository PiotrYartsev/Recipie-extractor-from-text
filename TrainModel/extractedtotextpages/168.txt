 
SAVORY TOMATO–RED WINE BUTTER
SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 2/3 CUP/165 ML
This is a big-ﬂavored butter sauce that wants to be served
with poultry or meat. I panfry hamburgers and serve them
with this sauce as though they were little steaks: no buns,
just juicy meat and a more glamorous ketchup.

1 tbsp minced shallot
3 whole canned tomatoes
1 fresh r osemary sprig, 3 in/7.5 cm long

1/4 tsp granulated sugar
Kosher salt

tbsp if needed
