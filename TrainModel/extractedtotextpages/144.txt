Butter sauces have two main components: a base made
from reducing one or two acidic liquids and the butter .
Aromatics or other ﬂavorings are also usually involved, but
they are merely delicious additions and are not essential to
the architecture of the sauce.
The reduction phase is a matter of letting the liquids boil
down until only a tablespoon or two of syrupy liquid are left
in the pan. As this happens, I like to scrape down the sides
of the pan with a heat-resistant rubber spatula (one of my
top kitchen utensils!) to incorporate any splashes back into
the main volume. That simple action helps develop the
ﬂavor of the sauce because the small droplets on the pan
sides are reducing even faster and getting lightly
caramelized or toasted. When they are blended back into
the main sauce base, they bring that ﬂavor with them.
The butter phase is what gives people anxiety . The idea is
to add cold butter to the reduced acidic liquid in such a
way that you encourage the butter to melt but also remain
emulsiﬁed and creamy (rather than melt to the point where
the butterfat separates and it becomes oily). Most recipes
instruct you to do this over very low heat, adding one small
chunk of butter at a time and avoiding boiling at all costs.
You can do it that way , but I think it’s easier and the
emulsion is more stable (so your sauce won’t separate as it
sits) if you add the butter all at once over medium-high
heat and let the sauce actually boil. This method has the
added beneﬁt of producing a hotter sauce, as well. Chef
Chambrette, my favorite teacher at La V arenne cooking
school, taught me to make beurre blanc this way , and I’ve
never looked back.
Using pristine, best-quality butter is, of course, important
for the success of a butter sauce. Although I like salted
butter for eating, unsalted is best here so that you can
