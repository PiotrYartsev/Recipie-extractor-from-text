Sometimes it’s nice to have someone else do the cooking,
even in your own cookbook, so I invited my friend, food
writer and awesome recipe developer , Matthew Card to

Panko, crisp Japanese-style bread crumbs, is stocked in the

1/2 cup/65 g all-purpose ﬂour
Kosher salt and fr eshly gr ound black pepper
2 large eggs
11/2 tsp hot-pepper sauce such as Sriracha
1/2 cup/35 g pank o
1/2 cup/50 g unsweetened shr edded dried coconut
2 tbsp sesame seeds
Finely grated zest of 1 lime
4 small skinless, boneless chick en br east halves, about 6

3 tbsp unsalted butter
5 tbsp/75 ml canola or other neutral vegetable oil
1/3 cup/75 ml Jalapeño -Lime- Ginger Butter Sauce
Have ready three small, shallow bowls. In the ﬁrst bowl,
season the ﬂour generously with salt and pepper . In the
second bowl, whisk together the eggs and hot-pepper sauce
until blended. In the third bowl, stir together the bread
