 
ANCHOVY BUTTER SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 1/2 CUP/120 ML
This is a sauce for anchovy lovers; the ﬂavor is quite
pronounced. But it is also a sauce that could recruit people
who are tentative about anchovies, because the lemon and
butter temper the anchovy assertiveness in a truly delicious
way.
Anchovies oxidize quickly after the can or jar is opened
(even when stored in the refrigerator), so use a fresh
supply for this recipe. This sauce is fantastic on grilled red
peppers or eggplant, as a dip for raw endive spears or
steamed asparagus or artichokes, or drizzled over thinly
sliced grilled skirt or ﬂank steak.
