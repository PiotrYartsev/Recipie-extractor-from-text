BOILED DUMPLINGS
If you’re new to making dumplings, start with the boiled dumplings 
in this chapter, like Shui Jiao (page 36) and Beef and Scallion Dump-
lings (page 41). Boiling is the simplest cooking method and ensures a 
tender, juicy filling. Many of the fillings you’ll find here also work in 
the steamed or pan-fried dumplings in chapters 4 and 5. You can also 
change up the wrappers and folding methods to suit your taste.
