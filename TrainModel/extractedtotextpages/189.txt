MAKES ABOUT 1 1/4 CUPS/300 ML
Béchamel is a home-economics-class sauce. Y ou learn to
make it, but you never conceive of using it again. But a
good béchamel has its place in the world, though mostly as
a supporting player rather than a star . You can’t make a
cheese souﬄé without béchamel, some delicious lasagnas
are made moist with béchamel (called besciamella in
Italian), and real mac and cheese is all about the sauce,
which starts with béchamel. Many béchamels are made
with only milk, but I’m adding 30 percent cream because I
like the depth of ﬂavor it imparts. Don’t be tempted to add
a lot of nutmeg. It’s fun to grate, but it can call unwanted
attention to itself .
2 tbsp unsalted butter
2 tbsp all-purpose ﬂour
11/4 cups/300 ml whole milk
1/2 cup/120 ml heavy cr eam or cr ème fraîche
1/4 tsp k osher salt
Freshly gr ound black pepper
4 or 5 scrapes of fr esh nutmeg
In a medium saucepan, combine the butter and ﬂour over
medium-high heat and whisk to blend as the butter melts.
