Kosher salt and fr eshly gr ound black pepper
Hot-pepper sauce such as Sriracha
In a medium, heavy sauté pan, heat the oil over medium
heat. Add the bell pepper and chile, cover the pan, reduce
the heat to low , and cook, stirring occasionally , until very
soft, fragrant, and lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Add
the garlic and cook for 1 minute longer . Add the saﬀron and
cook, stirring frequently , for about 30 seconds. P our in the
wine, raise the heat to high, and simmer until the liquid has
reduced to about 1 tbsp (the bell pepper and other solids
will take up more volume than 1 tbsp, of course), 4 to 6
minutes. Add the broth, ﬁsh stock, and rosemary and boil
until reduced to about 1/2 cup/120 ml liquid, 8 to 10
minutes.
Now add the cream and continue to boil until reduced to
about 1 cup/240 ml liquid, 9 to 12 minutes longer . Strain
the sauce through a ﬁne-mesh sieve, pressing on the solids
to extract all of the juice. Return the sauce to the pan over
low heat and add the lemon juice and zest; heat until quite
warm. Season with salt, pepper , and hot-pepper sauce. (If
using canned broth and/or clam juice, you may not need
much or any salt.) Serve right away .
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 4
days. The sauce does not fr eeze well.
QUICK CHANGE  Add 2 tbsp pastis or other anise-ﬂavor ed
liqueur with the white wine and 1/2 cup/20 g ﬁnely sliced
fresh basil with the lemon zest.
