minutes. Y ou don’t want the pears to get mushy , so begin
checking them often after about 10 minutes.
Carefully transfer the pears to shallow bowls or dessert
plates. If the sauce looks thin because of accumulated
juices, put the pan on the stove top and simmer the sauce
for a couple of minutes to reduce and thicken. When the
pears have cooled just a touch, add a scoop of ice cream to
each serving, drizzle the sauce from the pan over the pears
and ice cream, and tuck a few cookies into the ice cream to
serve. P ass the remaining cookies on a plate.
TINY PECAN COOKIES
MAKES ABOUT 7 DOZEN 1 1/2-IN/4-CM COOKIES
This recipe makes a lot of cookies, but the dough freezes
beautifully , so I suggest baking as many cookies as you like
and then freezing the rest of the dough for next time. It will
keep for up to 2 months. The cookies are meltingly
delicious, so be sure to bake some extras for the cook.
