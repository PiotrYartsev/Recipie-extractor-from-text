 
ASIAN PEANUT SAUCE
MAKES 1 3/4 CUPS/420 ML
We all know that skewers of grilled satay are just an excuse
to eat the peanut sauce that usually comes with them, so
make a lot of this sauce and use it during the week on
grilled meats and vegetables, on noodle dishes, or spring
rolls.
There are many approaches to making this sauce, and
usually , I take a multicultural and easy approach—I use
mass-market peanut butter , which is simpler than whole
nuts, plus it gives the sauce a lovely consistency that stays
emulsiﬁed with the other ingredients better . If you can’t
ﬁnd the small can of coconut milk I call for , buy the larger
size, measure out 1/2 cup plus 3 tbsp/165 ml, and freeze the
rest.
Be sure to tinker with the ﬁnal seasoning until until the
sauce has a bright tension from tart lime juice, sweet
coconut milk, spicy hot-pepper sauce, and salty ﬁsh sauce.
