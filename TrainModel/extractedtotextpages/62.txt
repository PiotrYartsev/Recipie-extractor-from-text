Sweetened red bean paste is a common ingredient in many Chinese desserts. The red adzuki 
beans are cooked in a sugar syrup, then mashed into a paste. To enhance the unique flavor 
of the beans, this recipe calls for a little orange zest, but this is optional.
2 (7-ounce) cans sweet red 
bean paste
Grated zest of 
1 orange (optional)
1 batch Bao Dough 
(page 22)
Mix it uP: After steaming, 
pan-fry the bottoms of the baos 
using the potsticker cook-
ing method (see page 70) to 
createÂ a crispy-bottomed bao.1. Make the filling: In a small bowl, stir together 
the bean paste and orange zest (if using) until 
thoroughly combined. Cut 24 (2-inch) squares of 
parchment paper and set aside.
2. Roll out the wrappers and fold the dumplings: Cut 
the dough into 24 equal pieces (see page 24). Keep 
the dough pieces covered under plastic wrap.
3. Use your fingertips to flatten and stretch one piece 
of dough into a 3-inch circle. Place the circle flat 
on one palm. Spoon 1 heaping tablespoon of fill-
ing into the center. Gather the edges of the dough 
together and pinch tightly at the top. Place the bao, 
pinched-side up, on a parchment square, then place 
it into a stainless-steel steaming basket. Repeat 
with the remaining dough and filling, arranging the 
baos 2 inches apart in the steamer baskets, or about 
6 baos per steamer basket.
4. Cook and serve: Stack the baskets, covering the 
top tier loosely with plastic wrap. Let the baos rise at 
room temperature for 30 minutes.
5. In a stockpot, bring 3 cups water to a boil. Stack 
two steamer baskets over the stockpot and steam 
for 12 minutes over high heat, adding more water, 
as needed.  Repeat with the remaining baos, adding 
more water to the pot, as needed. T ransfer the baos 
to a warm platter.
