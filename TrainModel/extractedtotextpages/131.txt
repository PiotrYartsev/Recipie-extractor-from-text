 
FRESH CHILE AND SUMMER TOMATO
SALSA
MAKES ABOUT 3 CUPS/720 ML
This is a regulation fresh salsa, nothing groundbreaking
but delicious nonetheless. It’s also a template for
improvisation. Y ou can play with the mix of chiles, try
diﬀerent types of tomatoes, add extra spices, use diﬀerent
herbs, and even include diced fruit, black beans, or diced
radish or jicama. I’m taking the unusual step of soaking the
onion in cold water to leech out some of the harsher
compounds. I love the ﬂavor of raw onion but it can feel
like an assault on my system sometimes. Y ou can opt to
skip this step. I salt the tomato ahead of time to draw oﬀ
some of the juice and concentrate the tomato ﬂavor . This
prevents the salsa from being watery . And many salsa
recipes don’t call for oil, but I ﬁnd that the oil helps unlock
and distribute ﬂavors better .
The salsa itself is immensely versatile: pair it with chips, of
course, but also with everything from fresh ﬁsh, eggs,
sliced steak, beans, and corn bread to grilled cheese.
