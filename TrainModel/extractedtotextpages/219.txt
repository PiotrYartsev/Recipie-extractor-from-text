 
ROSEMARY-MINT MAYONNAISE
MAKES ABOUT 1 1/2 CUPS/360 ML
Rosemary is one of my favorite herbs, but its assertive
ﬂavor and wiry texture means that I rarely use it in
uncooked dishes. Here I infuse the oil with the rosemary
ﬂavor , taking texture out of the equation. The mayonnaise
is excellent with cold roast lamb, as a dip for little lamb
sliders, or slathered onto a roast beef sandwich.
1 to 1 1/4 cups/240 to 300 ml mild e xtra-virgin olive oil,
canola, grapeseed, or a mixtur e
2 fresh r osemary sprigs, 4 in/10 cm long
1/2 cup/10 g very lightly pack ed fresh mint leaves
1/2 cup/15 g lightly pack ed fresh ﬂat-leaf parsley leaves
2 egg yolks
2 tsp white wine vinegar, plus mor e if needed
1/2 tsp granulated sugar
1/4 tsp Dijon mustar d
Kosher salt
In a small saucepan, heat 1 cup/240 ml of the oil and the
rosemary over low heat until the oil gets quite hot but the
rosemary does not start to sizzle (check the oil temperature
with an instant-read thermometer , if you have one; aim for
140°F/60°C). K eep the oil at this temperature on the heat
