(page 54) and pan-fried buns such as Shengjian Bao (page 75). The key ingredient here is 
cake fl  our, which creates a soft, tender crumb.

with plastic wrap and let the mixture rise in a warm 
place for 1 hour.

the starter. In another bowl, sift together 2 cups of

until the dough becomes a sticky, shaggy mass.

dough to it. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, 
or until smooth, sprinkling with more flour 
as necessary.
6. Coat the inside of a large bowl with cooking spray.

smooth ball. Keep the dough tightly wrapped in 
plastic wrap until ready to use. Do not let it sit at 
room temperature for more than 1 hour to avoid 
overproofing.
