MAKES 1 1/2 CUPS/360 ML
The key to this sauce is to make sure that the ﬂavors of the
caramel and the orange remain in balance. Unlike the other
sauces in this chapter , I cook the sugar and honey only
until amber , and not long enough to develop any bitter
notes. The orange zest has enough delicious bitterness on
its own. Use a rasp-style grater , such as a Microplane, to
ﬁnely grate the zest. Y ou can leave the zest in the sauce,
but if you want the sauce very smooth, or if the orange
ﬂavor is too strong, strain it out.
1/2 cup/100 g granulated sugar
1/2 cup/120 ml honey
1/2 cup/120 ml heavy cr eam
1/4 cup/60 ml fr esh orange juice (fr om about 1 orange)
1/2 tsp lightly pack ed ﬁnely grated orange zest
1/8 tsp pur e vanilla e xtract, plus mor e if needed

In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and
honey (you need a lot of extra volume in the pan because
the honey makes the mixture foam up during cooking) over
medium-high heat. Cook, using a small whisk or metal
