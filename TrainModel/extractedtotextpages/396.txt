MAKES ABOUT 1 1/4 CUPS/300 ML
Adding ﬂavors traditionally found in Mexican hot chocolate
—cinnamon, almond, and chile, in particular—gives this
sauce an intriguing complexity and spicy kick. If you’re
wary of chile heat, use less ground chipotle to start.
Sometimes I stir this sauce into hot milk for a drink that
combats drizzly winter mornings, but more often I pour it
onto a simple cake topped with a scoop of ice cream.
4 oz/115 g dark chocolate, chopped
3/4 cup/180 ml heavy cr eam
4 tsp granulated sugar
1 tsp instant espr esso powder

Put the chocolate in a medium stainless-steel or other
heatproof bowl.
In a small, heavy saucepan, bring the cream just to a
