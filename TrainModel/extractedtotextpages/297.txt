prepare the frangipane. R aise the oven temperature to
350°F/180°C/gas 4.
TO MAKE THE FRANGIP ANE,  in a food processor , combine
the butter and confectioners’ sugar and process until ﬂuﬀy .
Add the almonds and process until blended. Add the eggs
and vanilla and process just until combined. Do not
overprocess or the frangipane may separate.
Carefully and evenly spread the frangipane in the cooled
tart crust. Drain the prunes and blot dry on a paper towel.
Arrange the prunes in a pretty pattern over the frangipane,
pressing them slightly to nestle them in it.
Bake the tart until the frangipane is light brown and puﬀy ,
25 to 35 minutes. Let cool on a rack. Serve slightly warm or
at room temperature. Remove the pan sides and slide the
tart onto a serving plate. Cut into slices and place on
individual plates. Spoon a thick ribbon of the warm sabayon
around each slice.
