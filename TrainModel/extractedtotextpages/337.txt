In a medium, heavy saucepan, heat the oil over medium
heat. Add the onion and 1/4 tsp salt and cook, stirring often,
until the onion is soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add
the cherries, sugar , vinegar , mustard seeds, thyme, and dry
mustard, stir together , and bring to a simmer . Cover and
cook, stirring occasionally , until the cherries partially
collapse but have not turned to mush, 10 to 14 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat, let cool slightly , and then
taste and adjust the seasoning with salt, sugar , and vinegar
if needed. Serve warm, at room temperature, or cold.

get too mushy .
QUICK CHANGE  Use chopped, pitted Italian prune plums
instead of cher ries.
