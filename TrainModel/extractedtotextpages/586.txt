584 Glossary 
Wild yeasts: Yeasts which can initiate a fer­
mentation of grape juice, but are not toler­
ant enough to ethanol to complete the fer­
mentation. They are usually associated with 
the grape berry. Species are included from 
the genera: Hansenula, Kloeckera, Hansenias­
pora, and Metschnikowia. (See also Yeast) 
Wmemaking: The part of enology specifically 
related to selecting and converting grapes 
to wine ready to be consumed. The single 
word is preferred, unless special meaning is 
to be expressed. Winemaking and that of 
beer are interesting to contrast. Preferable 
usage could be "making of wine and beer 
are interesting to contrast." 
Wine spirits: Alcohol and associated compo­
nents of the distillate prepared from grape 
wine. By laws in the United States and many 
other (but not all) countries, other fermen­
tation sources can not be used in wines or 
brandies, much less ethanol from 
petroleum. 
Wine yeast: Yeasts that can ferment wine 
grape juice to completion (dry) and pro-duce a wine free of off-flavors and off-odors. 
Rather limited to species of the genus Sac­
charomyces and perhaps Schizosaccharomyces. 
They can also be spoilage yeasts, if present 
in an unwanted situation, e.g., semisweet 
bottled table wine. (See also Yeasts) 
WSA (Wine Spirits Addition): Fortification, 
the addition of distilled alcohol during 
winemaking. The technique used to make 
stable sweet wines by arresting the fermen­
tation before completion by adding brandy 
of high proof. Traditional ports, sherries, 
muscatels, etc., are made this way, and com­
monly are 18% alcohol. 
Yeast: By brief scientific definition, a single­
celled fungus. Wine-related yeasts are those 
found associated with grapes, vineyards, 
winery equipment, wine storage containers, 
or in wine. Here they are subdivided into 
three groups: Wine yeasts, Wild yeasts, and 
Spoilage yeasts. 
Yeast hulls: Empty (autolyzed) yeast cell walls. 
Sometimes called yeast ghosts.
