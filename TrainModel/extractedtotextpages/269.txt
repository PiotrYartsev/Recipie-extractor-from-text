Youcan also boost the umami proﬁle by adding a spoonful
of dark miso or a few drops of soy sauce or W orcestershire
sauce.
DO YOU W ANT TO ADD OTHER FLA VORS?  I am usually a
purist when it comes to gravy , but here are a handful of
enhancements that won’t overpower its natural goodness:
small amount of chopped fr esh thyme or ﬂat-leaf
parsley, or a tiny bit of chopped fr esh tar ragon,
especially with chick en
splash of heavy cr eam or cr ème fraîche just to r ound oﬀ
sharp edges and enhance the te xture, but not to mak e it
creamy—cr eam gravy is a whole thing of its own
small spoonful of Dijon mustar d
few dr ops of Cognac
squeeze of fr esh lemon juice
DO YOU NEED TO STRAIN?  I’m lazy and don’t like to take
unnecessary steps in the kitchen, so I only strain my gravy
if it has ﬂour-lump issues (which can happen even to an
experienced cook). If it is a matter of a few bits of chicken
skin or onion, I leave the gravy au natural. T o strain, use a
large ﬁne-mesh sieve that can be positioned over a big
liquid measuring cup or a bowl with a spout to make it easy
to pour the ﬁnal sauce into a gravy boat or pitcher .
ALL-PURPOSE TURKEY BROTH
A few years ago, after repeated frustration from trying to
make a chicken broth that tasted like something, I realized
I was working with the wrong bird. Modern chickens—even
their backs, necks, and wings—just don’t have much ﬂavor .
Turkey seemed more promising, and when I learned that I
could buy just turkey necks, I knew that was the way to go .
