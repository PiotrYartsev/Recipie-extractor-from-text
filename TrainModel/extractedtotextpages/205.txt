PERFECT CHEESE SOUFFLÉ
SERVES 4 TO 6
I love the fact that a lot of people
think souﬄés are temperamental,
slightly risky dishes to make,
because they aren’t, of course,
but I want to keep the mystique
going! The most critical part of
making a souﬄé is to make sure
that not even a speck of yolk gets
into the whites when you
separate the eggs. Souﬄés can
even be prepped hours ahead and
baked at the last minute (ready
the base completely , then whip
the egg whites and fold them in
just before the whole thing goes in the oven), which is
fortunate because they make an unexpected and splendid
ﬁrst course for a dinner party .
I supercharge this souﬄé with an amount of cheese beyond
what a French cook might add, but I like the way it tastes,
and if you’re lucky enough to have leftovers, they’re
scrumptious at room temperature with a green salad.
