whose ﬂuﬀy texture must be appreciated right away). That
means they are an excellent addition to any host’s
repertoire of do-ahead desserts. They will keep in an
airtight jar or other container in the refrigerator for several
weeks and in the freezer for a couple of months or more.
Chocolate sauces do set up fairly ﬁrmly in the fridge,
however , so you must reheat them gently . I use a double
boiler to avoid any threat of scorching, but you can reheat
directly in a saucepan if you use very low heat and stir a
lot. Or , use your microwave on the lowest setting.
WHAT IS “SEIZING” AND HOW DO I
AVOID IT?
Seizing  is one of my favorite cooking terms. It sounds so
dramatic, almost dangerous! But if it happens to you,
there will be some drama, so it’s an apt term. Chocolate
seizes if a small amount of water (or watery liquid such
as brandy) ﬁnds its way into the chocolate while it is
melting. That little bit of liquid messes up the balance
among cocoa particles, sugar , and cocoa butter , causing
the nonfat ingredients to clump together . If chocolate
seizes, it will look grainy and matte rather than glossy
and smooth. But if you add enough water at the outset,
you won’t have this problem.
The rule of thumb is any added liquid must be at least 25
percent of the weight of the chocolate. Another way to
express the rule is for every four parts chocolate, you
must have one part water .
