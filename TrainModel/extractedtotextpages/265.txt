to come along, but don’t worry about scraping them all
up. The rest of them will dissolve later . Just take care
that nothing is burning. This is your roux.
When the roux is smooth, turn the heat to low and
cook, whisking constantly , for about 1 minute more, to
develop some ﬂavors in the ﬂour .
5. Now begin pouring in the broth while whisking rapidly .
The key is to stay ahead of the lumps, whisking so
quickly that the roux absorbs and blends with the liquid
before it has a chance to get too thick.
If you do see lumps developing, don’t worry . Just add a
bit more liquid and whisk until you work them out. If
they are intractable, you can strain them out later , so
carry on with the rest of the liquid.
At this point, all of the good brown bits should be
dissolved. If they are not, give them a scrape to
dislodge.
6. Pour in the defatted pan drippings that you collected
earlier and simmer the gravy for a minute or two, then
evaluate it.
HOW MUCH FAT TO FLOUR TO LIQUID?
A nice serving of gravy is 1/3 cup/75 ml per person,
meaning 1 cup/240 ml gravy serves three people.
For 1 cup gravy , you will need the following:
1 tbsp fat
11/2 tbsp ﬂour
