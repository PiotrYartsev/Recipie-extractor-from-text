Instead, it is a binder for potpie and crepe ﬁllings and for
the base of luxurious puréed vegetable soups.
In the non–roux -thickened category , you have lighter cream
sauces and not-so-light versions. The lighter specimens are
the most versatile, complex, and fun to make. These are
sauces in which you lay down layers of ﬂavor by
sequentially reducing liquids. F or example, you might start
with 1/2 cup/120 milliliters white wine that you cook down
to just a tablespoon or two; that produces a ﬂavor nugget
of acidity and fruitiness. Then you add chicken broth, which
you reduce by about three-fourths. The broth dissolves the
wine glaze, becomes concentrated and savory , and starts to
develop some body , especially if you’re using homemade
broth that contains a lot of collagen and other natural
thickeners.
Pay attention to the “tide rings” of reduced broth that
develop along the sides of the pan as the broth evaporates.
They become more fully reduced and sort of “toasted,”
creating even more complex ﬂavors, so be sure to scrape
them into the sauce as they form. Some chefs will
deliberately provoke this intensiﬁed reduction by adding
broth to the pan, reducing it way down, adding more broth,
and reducing again (at school, the chefs called this
remouiller , or “remoistening”).
The ﬁnal layer is the cream or crème fraîche, which you
also reduce so it gains viscosity and ﬂavor intensity . Along
the way , you may add other ingredients, such as a mirepoix
(chopped aromatic vegetables), herbs and spices,
mushrooms, and mustards.
The result of all this reduction (which often takes only
minutes, depending on the volume) is a sauce that is
