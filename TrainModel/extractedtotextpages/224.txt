In a food processor , combine the egg yolks, vinegar ,
mustard, garlic, and 1/2 tsp salt and pulse until well
blended. The yolks will likely be sprayed on the sides of the
bowl, so scrape them down with a rubber spatula. W ith the
motor running, begin adding the oil in a very slow stream.
You may need to stop and scrape again. As the mayonnaise
gets thicker , you can add the oil faster . When you have
incorporated almost all of the oil, slow down and watch the
sauce closely . If you see oil starting to separate out, stop
adding oil; the yolks have absorbed enough.
With the motor running, add the paprika, roasted pepper ,
and a few dashes of hot-pepper sauce. T aste and adjust the
seasoning with salt and hot-pepper sauce if needed.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5
days.

saﬀron thr eads in 1 tbsp war m water for 10 minutes and
