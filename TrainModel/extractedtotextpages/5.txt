6 Dumplings for BeginnersKitchen scale: The Master Dough recipes feature both volume and weight measure-
ments, so if you have a scale, by all means use it. Some cooks prefer to weigh the 
dough and fillings to maintain exact portions, too.
Portion scoop, #70: A commercial #70 scoop yields 70 portions from a quart of 
product. This size roughly translates to a generous tablespoon, which is a common 
amount of dumpling filling.
Tortilla press: If you have trouble manipulating the dough rolling it by hand, a tor -
tilla press can be a helpful alternative.
Wok: Choose a lightweight carbon steel or nonstick 12-inch wok and make sure 
to get a tight-fitting lid. Scanpan makes the most fantastic nonstick woks I have 
ever used.
Your Dumpling Pantry
A well-stocked pantry is key to cooking dumplings. The good news is that many of the 
ingredients used are staples that can last quite a while in the refrigerator or cupboard.
DOUGHS AND WRAPPERS
Active dry yeast: A leavening agent for bao dough; store in an airtight container in 
the freezer.
All-purpose flour: Choose unbleached flour for basic dumpling wrappers. 
Baking powder: Added to bao dough for extra fluffiness.
Cake flour: Low in protein and bleached, this finely-milled flour gives the steamed 
baos their bright white color and fluffy, cake-like texture.
Store-bought dumpling wrappers: Round in shape, they are slightly thicker than 
wonton wrappers and can be used for virtually any dumpling, like potstickers, gyoza, 
and even shu mai. Look for them in the refrigerated section of your local supermar -
ket, usually near the tofu.
Store-bought wonton wrappers: Itâ€™s hard to make wonton wrappers from scratch 
at home and get the paper-thin sheets without a pasta roller. Square-shaped 
store-bought wrappers can be great time-savers for wontons and parcel-folded 
dumplings, such as crab rangoon. Choose thin wrappers for boiled wontons, 
medium and thick wonton wrappers for steamed and deep-fried dumplings.
