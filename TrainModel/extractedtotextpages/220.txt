for about 10 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat
and let the rosemary steep for another 20 to 30 minutes.
Taste the oil; it should be fragrant and ﬂavored but not
bitter . Remove and discard the rosemary sprigs. Let the oil
cool completely .
Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil over high heat.
Add the mint and parsley leaves, stir for 2 to 3 seconds,
and then drain the herbs in a colander . Immediately rinse
the herbs with very cold water to stop the cooking. Drain
well and blot them completely dry with paper towels.
In a food processor , combine the egg yolks, vinegar , sugar ,
mustard, and 1 tsp salt and pulse until well blended. The
yolks will likely be sprayed on the sides of the bowl, so
scrape them down with a rubber spatula. W ith the motor
running, begin adding the rosemary oil in a very slow
stream. Y ou may need to stop and scrape again. As the
mayonnaise gets thicker , you can add the oil faster . When
you have incorporated almost all of the oil, slow down and
watch the sauce closely . If you see oil starting to separate
out, stop adding oil; the yolks have absorbed enough. If you
think you can still add more oil, add the ﬁnal 1/4 cup/60 ml
or so of unﬂavored oil.
Add the mint and parsley and process until well combined
into the mayonnaise. T aste and adjust the seasoning with
salt and vinegar if needed.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5
days.
QUICK CHANGE  Heat 2 lar ge fresh thyme sprigs in the oil
along with the r osemary and substitute basil for the parsley .
