The Basics: a really useful cookB ook 560* A good rule of thumb is to allow 800 g to 1 kg sugar for every 1 kg of prepared fruit 
(fruit that is peeled, cored and chopped, ready to cook).
The 10 rules of jam making
1. Always use premium fruit. Avoid fruit that is overripe, damaged or covered with 
blemishes. Under-ripe fruit takes too long to cook and sabotages the setting temperature.2. When cooking fruit with the skin on, do not add the sugar until the skins have softened completely. Once the sugar is added, the skins will not break down further.3. Use a large pot to make jams. Jam boils, bubbles and splatters, and may give a nasty burn if cooked in a small saucepan.4. Do not be tempted to make large quantities in one go. Colour and flavour retention is best achieved in smaller batches (less than 2 kg of fruit and sugar combined).5. Avoid using too much sugar thinking the jam will set better. Quite the opposite is true—too much sugar counters the pectin and leaves the jam syrupy.6. Not enough sugar in the jam causes rapid deterioration as well as poor setting.7. Avoid burning the jam—it is important to stir the jam in the initial stages to lift fruit from the base of the pan.8. Do not be tempted to cook the jam for longer than is required. Going past the recommended 105ºC can cause the jam to harden or become slightly chewy once it is cold.9. Be very aware of the fruit used for jam making and recognise the fruit’s pectin levels. Jam making really is an exact science.10. Patience, understanding and persistence are the 3 key elements of successful jam making.
Good luck!
