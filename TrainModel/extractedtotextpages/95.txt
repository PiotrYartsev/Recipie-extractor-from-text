Makes about 2 cups PreP  tiMe 5 minutes Cook tiMe 25 minutes
This robust oil is my secret ingredient for adding extra flavor to virtually any dish—just a 
dab gives an amazing flavor pop! You can use the oil hot or cold. Keep a small jar in your 
refrigerator, so it’s always on hand. Serve with Shui Jiao (page 36) or Fish and Napa Cab -
bage Dumplings (page 40).
4 to 6 scallions, white and 
green parts, thinly sliced
2-inch piece fresh ginger, 
peeled and grated or 
finely chopped
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup vegetable oil
Cooking tiP: This oil is a 
great way to use up bits of 
scallion and ginger hanging 
around in your fridge. Don’t let 
them go to waste. 1. In a medium heat-proof bowl, stir together the scal-
lions, ginger, and salt to combine. Set aside.
2. In a wok or skillet over medium-high heat, heat the 
vegetable oil until it just begins to smoke. Remove 
the wok from the heat and, carefully and slowly, 
pour the hot oil over the scallions and ginger, so it 
does not bubble over. Let the mixture cool for about 
20 minutes, or until cooled completely.
3. Refrigerate in an airtight jar until ready to use, or 
up to 3 days.
