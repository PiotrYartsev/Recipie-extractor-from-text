In a medium bowl, toss the ﬁgs with the oil, coating them
evenly . Arrange them, cut-side up, on a large rimmed
baking sheet. Sprinkle the cut sides with the sugar . If
grilling, transfer the ﬁgs to the grill rack, sugared-side up,
cover the grill, and grill the ﬁgs until they have softened
slightly and the sugar starts to bubble a bit, 7 to 9 minutes.
If broiling, place the ﬁgs on the baking sheet under the
broiler and broil to the same end for the same amount of
time.
Transfer the ﬁgs to a serving platter . Spoon the warm
sabayon over the ﬁgs, drizzle the balsamic reduction over
everything, and then sprinkle the amaretti over the top.
Serve right away .
JUMBLE OF BERRIES with GRATINÉED
HONEY-GINGER-TANGERINE SABAYON
SERVES 4 TO 6
I like the warm-cool temperature contrast of this dish and
the way the berry juices mingle with the rich sabayon on
the plate. A mix of fresh summer berries will give you the
most complexity here, but using just one or two types is
lovely as well. If you are lucky enough to live in blackberry
country , they are wonderful in this dish. Be sure to taste
your berries ﬁrst, and if they’re tart, add a touch more
sugar .
