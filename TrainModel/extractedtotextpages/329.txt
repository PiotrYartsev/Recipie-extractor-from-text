medium-high heat. Cover and cook just until the juices are
running and the berries have slightly collapsed, 3 to 4
minutes. Do not let the juices caramelize.
Scrape everything into a food processor and whiz until
smooth (aside from the blackberry seeds). Strain through a
ﬁne-mesh sieve into a small bowl, using a wooden spoon or
rubber spatula to push as many solids through as you can.
You will end up with 2 to 3 tbsp seeds, which you can toss
out.
Stir the almond extract into the berry purée. T aste and
adjust with more sugar or lemon juice if needed. Add the
vinegar if the sauce needs extra punch. Serve slightly
warm, at room temperature, or cool.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5
days or fr eeze for up to 2 months.
QUICK CHANGE  Use Demerara or turbinado sugar in place
of the confectioners’ sugar .
