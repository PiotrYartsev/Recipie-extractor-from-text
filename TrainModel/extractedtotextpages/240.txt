Once this yolk foam develops, you whisk in melted butter to
make an emulsion that turns thick, very glossy , and
unctuous. The more gentle the temperature, the longer it
will take, but that’s a good thing. It gives you more control
over the texture of the eggs and lets you whisk in lots of air
for a lovely , ﬂuﬀy consistency .
WHAT CAN GO WRONG AND HOW CAN I
FIX IT?
There are three potential trouble spots when making a
hollandaise. The ﬁrst is to avoid scrambling or overcooking
the yolks by whisking them over heat that is too high. This
is easily solved by using a double boiler (and paying
attention). Although I’ve seen chefs make hollandaise in a
saucepan in direct contact with a burner , the gentler heat
of a double boiler (a bowl set over a pan of simmering
water) gives you lots of control and conﬁdence—just go
slow and have patience.
The second potential trouble spot is failing to achieve an
emulsion between the egg yolks and the butter . If you add
the melted butter too quickly or add too much, the yolks
won’t be able to absorb it all and the sauce will “break” and
look oily and separated. By adding the butter slowly , you
will see the point at which it is no longer being absorbed
well and you can just slow down or stop there.
The third trouble spot has to do with ingredients, not
technique. A hollandaise sauce is rich, of course, but its
ﬂavor is actually quite delicate. And delicate can become
bland very quickly if you aren’t careful. How many
uninspired servings of eggs Benedict have we all endured?
I prefer eggs from the farmers’ market because they have
