As the winter months drag on, the dry, cold air makes me crave richer soups like this sooth -
ing coconut curry soup served with Spicy Shrimp Dumplings (page 47). I like to think the 
coconut milk is nourishing my skin from the inside out.
2 tablespoons coconut oil 
or vegetable oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1-inch piece fresh ginger, 
peeled and minced
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon yellow 
curry powder
2 cups vegetable stock
Generous pinch kosher salt
2 (14-ounce) cans 
coconut milk
1 batch cooked Spicy 
Shrimp Dumplings 
(page 47)
Juice of 1/2 lime
2 tablespoons roughly 
chopped fresh cilantro
Cooking tiP: Use full-fat 
coconut milk for the most 
robust flavor.1. In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, heat 
the coconut oil until it shimmers. Add the onion and 
sweat for about 7 minutes until soft and translucent. 
Add the ginger and garlic and saut√© for 1 minute, 
stirring to keep the garlic from browning. Stir in the 
curry powder and cook for about 30 seconds until 
fragrant.
2. Add the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Add the 
salt and reduce the heat to low. Simmer the broth for 
10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the coconut  
milk and continue to simmer on low heat for 10 minutes  
more. Do not let the broth boil. 
3. Divide the cooked dumplings and soup among 4 to 
6 warmed bowls. Garnish with cilantro to serve.
