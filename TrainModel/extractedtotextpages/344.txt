MAKES ONE 8-IN/20-CM CAKE;  
SERVES 6 TO 8
If your mother didn’t make this cake, your grandmother
probably did. It’s one of those easy , comforting desserts
that feel appropriate for a family supper , a dinner party , or
anything in between. The batter separates into three layers
as it bakes: a light, spongy cake on top, a moist pudding in
the middle, and a saucy layer on the bottom.
Even though this dessert makes its own sauce, I like to add
a contrasting blueberry sauce as much for its deep purple
color as for its ﬂavor . Most recipes call for baking this kind
of cake in a water bath, but I think that’s too fussy . I just
bake it at a lower temperature, which protects its delicate
texture.
