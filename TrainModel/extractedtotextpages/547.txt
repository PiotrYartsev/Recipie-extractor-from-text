The Really UsefUl InfoRmaTIon 559* Once packed, wipe the jars or bottles and dry them thoroughly before attaching labels 
marked with the name of the preserve as well as the ‘packed on’ date. 
Storing
* Light has an adverse effect on bottled preserves and it is therefore recommended to store 
them in a cool, dark and dry place.
* Should you live in a wet, humid climate, then it is best to keep the preserves in the 
refrigerator.
* Once any preserve has been opened then it is necessary to keep the opened jar in the 
fridge.ESSEntial prESErving ingrE diEntS
Sugars—used for preserving jams, marmalades, candying fruits and in curing meats.
Salts—used for brines, pickling and curing meats.Acids—used in jams to prevent discoloration (lemon juice, citric acid and tamarind).Vinegars—used for pickles, chutneys and relishes.Fats and oils—used as a sealant. 
pEctin
* Pectin has its own entry due to the important role it has in setting jams and marmalades. 
Fruits have varying pectin levels so it is important to check the cooked fruit to determine 
if pectin needs to be added. To test for pectin content—combine 1 tablespoon of the cooked, unsweetened fruit juice with 1 tablespoon of methylated spirits. Stir for 2–3 minutes or until the fruit juice starts to clot. A large clot or lump indicates a high pectin content, while many small, broken clots mean a low pectin content. 
* Lemon juice is added to fruit with a low pectin content to compensate by drawing out the 
pectin in the fruit. It also prevents the jam from crystallising. 
* Fruit high in pectin include—apples, redcurrants, quinces, black currants, citrus fruit 
and gooseberries. 
* Raspberries, passionfruits, plums and apricots have a medium pectin content. 
* Strawberries, peaches, mangoes, figs, pineapples, rhubarb and cherries have a low pectin 
content, and therefore need added pectin when making into jams. 
* Commercial jam setting agents can be purchased from supermarkets.
Sugar thE rmomEtErS
Do not even think about making jam without a sugar thermometer. When a jam is heated to 105ºC, the high sugar content reacts with the pectin and forms a gel. If you do not have a sugar thermometer, then test by spooning some jam onto a plate and check its consistency when cold. 
Sugar in jamS
* It’s important to note that sugar is not just added in large amounts to sweeten a jam. 
Its main purpose is to prevent the fruit from fermenting or forming mould. Add too much 
sugar and you run the risk of the jam becoming syrupy and not setting properly. Add too little sugar and the jam may not set and will deteriorate faster.
