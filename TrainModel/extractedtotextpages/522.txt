alternativeS  to Sugar
In baking, sugar provides a chemical reaction as well as acting as a sweetener. Be aware of this when substituting with another sweetener in cooking, because the alternatives may not provide the bulk and colouring sugar can provide. There are numerous synthetic sweeteners on the market, as well as some good natural sweeteners, which in some cases are many hundreds of times sweeter than sugar. Do your research to establish the benefits and problems of alternatives, depending on your reason for cutting back on sugar. As a note, vegans may choose not to consume white sugars because they can be refined with the use of charcoal made from animal bones. 
Agave nectar is a sweetener extracted from the agave, a large succulent plant with 
thick fleshy leaves. It is a very thick liquid that goes a long way.
Corn syrup is available light or dark. The light syrup has been clarified, removing 
colour and cloudy particles. Dark syrup has had refiners added to produce a stronger-tasting, dark-coloured syrup. Corn syrup is high in fructose, which absorbs and retains moisture well, so using it in baked goods can result in a moist product that stays fresher for longer. Corn syrup can be replaced with other syrups but is not as sweet as, say, honey or maple.
Fructose is a term for sugar found in honey, corn and certain fruits. The sweetest 
of the simple sugars, it is almost twice as sweet as sucrose and turns into glucose once ingested. Fructose can be bought in granulated form.
Fruit juice makes for a good sweetener, but for many diabetics, a concentrated fruit 
juice is still off limits. Fruit crystals, although hard to find, are available. 
Glucose powder is made from grapes or fruit, and is closer to a pure glucose. Both are 
sold at chemists as dietary supplements, as syrup, powder or tablets. Glucose is much less sweet than sugar, and is valued as an energy booster because it heads straight for the blood stream.
