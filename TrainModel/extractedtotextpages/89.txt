Our favorite Chinese restaurant serves a generous bowl of fried peanuts as a free appetizer 
as we browse the menu. If you’ve only ever had roasted peanuts from the grocery store, try 
this recipe—freshly fried peanuts are a revelation!
3 cups fresh peanuts with 
skin, rinsed and drained
1 cup vegetable oil or 
peanut oil
Generous pinch kosher salt
Mix it uP: Toss in a pinch of 
five-spice powder with the salt 
to boost the flavor.1. Line a large plate with paper towels and set aside.
2. In a medium skillet over medium-low heat, com-
bine the peanuts and oil. Cook the peanuts for 5 to 
6 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the nuts 
smell toasty and you hear a faint popping noise. 
Gently shake the pan to redistribute the peanuts in 
the oil so they fry evenly.
3. Using a skimmer, lift the peanuts from the hot oil 
and transfer to the prepared plate. Set aside to cool 
slightly. T ransfer the slightly cooled peanuts to a 
large bowl and toss with the salt. Serve warm.
