This sauce is all about minimal effort for maximum payoff. Its fiery red color and flavor can

eggs to steamed rice, and even avocado toast!
4 tablespoons Sichuan 
chili flakes
2 tablespoons white 
sesame seeds
1 star anise pod
1 cinnamon stick
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup vegetable oil
Cooking tiP: To achieve 
the bright red color, you need 
Sichuan chili flakes. For a 
spicier sauce, add a few more 
tablespoons of chili flakes 
or try gochugaru, or Korean 
chili flakes.1. In a medium heat-proof bowl, stir together the chili 
flakes, sesame seeds, star anise, cinnamon stick, and 
salt and set aside.
2. In a wok or skillet over medium-high heat, heat the 
oil. When it just begins to smoke, turn off the heat 
and carefully pour the hot oil over the spices. The 
mixture will sizzle and bubble up. Let cool for about 
20 minutes, or until cooled completely. 
3. Stir the sauce. Remove and discard the cinnamon 
stick and star anise. T ransfer the sauce to an air -
tight jar.  Refrigerate until ready to use, and up to 
3 to 4 weeks.
