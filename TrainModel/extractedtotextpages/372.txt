 
BUTTER-RUM TOFFEE SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 1 1/2 CUPS/360 ML
Boiling brown sugar with butter and heavy cream makes a
sauce that isn’t technically caramel, but it shares the same
deep and delicious tawny ﬂavor . The rum you use here is
key to the ﬂavor of the sauce, so aim for a good dark
Jamaican variety .
4 tbsp/55 g unsalted butter
2/3 cup/130 g lightly pack ed light or dark br own sugar
1/2 cup/120 ml heavy cr eam
1/4 cup/60 ml light cor n syrup
Kosher salt
3 tbsp dark rum such as Myers’s
In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the butter , brown
sugar , cream, corn syrup, and 1/2 tsp salt and bring to a boil
over medium-high heat. Boil, stirring occasionally , until the
sauce is smooth, glossy , and slightly thickened, about 4
minutes.
Remove from the heat and stir in the rum. Let the sauce
cool slightly and then taste it and add a little more salt if
needed. The sauce will thicken as it cools. Serve warm or at
room temperature.
