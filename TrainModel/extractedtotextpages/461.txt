The Basics: a really useful cookB ook 472Vegetable stock
Makes about 2 litres
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Â¼ cup light olive oil or vegetable oil
500 g onions, peeled and chopped400 g carrots, peeled and chopped500 g leeks, white part only, chopped, washed  
and drained
1 small fennel bulb, chopped (optional)2 bay leaves2 sprigs thyme50 g parsley stalks
Method:
1. heat the oil in a large soup or stock pot.2. add all the ingredients and cook on medium heat for 
5 minutes.
3. add enough cold water to cover the vegetables by  
5 cm.
4. increase the heat to bring just to the boil then 
reduce the heat so the stock is simmering.
5. cook for 45 minutes only. remove from the heat, 
stand for 10 minutes then strain.
6. cool before storing in the fridge. Vegetable stock 
loses flavour very quickly and by day 3, although not off, is hardly worth using. Best used on the day or on day 2, or freeze.
