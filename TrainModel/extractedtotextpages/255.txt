Arrange the baguette slices on a large rimmed baking
sheet and broil until lightly toasted on one side, 1 to 2
minutes. Remove the pan from the oven, ﬂip the toasts, and
let them cool.
Spread about 1 tbsp of the salmon mixture on each cooled
toast, mounding the mixture slightly . Return the pan to the
broiler and cook until the salmonis bubbling and golden
brown, about 1 minute. Serve right away .
To make ahead: A fter topping the toasts with the salmon
mixture, refrigerate until very ﬁrm, about 30 minutes.
Individually wrap each chilled toast in plastic wrap,
transfer them all to a ziplock freezer bag, and freeze for up
to 2 months. T o serve, arrange the toasts, straight from the
freezer , in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and
bake in a 400°F/200°C/gas 6 oven until heated through and
toasty , 20 to 22 minutes. If they need more browning, ﬁnish
them under the broiler for another minute.

Here is another recipe created by my friend Matthew Card.
It’s a riﬀ on eggs Florentine (eggs Benedict but with
spinach instead of Canadian bacon or ham) and, like every
dish he makes, it is turbocharged with ﬂavor . It would also
be delicious with any of the other sauces in this chapter , so
feel free to experiment.
