CHICKEN, APPLE, and HAZELNUT SALAD
with SWEET ONION–CURRY MAYONNAISE
SERVES 4
I’ve never lost my love for what I think of as ladies
luncheon chicken salad, which is tender chicken with
apples or grapes and some kind of crunchy nut, all bound
together with mayonnaise. Tuck some of this salad into a
croissant and you have a classic sandwich (and to my mind,
the only sandwich that should be allowed on a croissant). I
call for purchased rotisserie chicken here, but you can also
use home-roasted chicken. Almonds, pecans, or walnuts are
a ﬁne substitute for hazelnuts.
