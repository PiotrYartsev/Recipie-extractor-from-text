 
RASPBERRY COULIS
MAKES ABOUT 1 CUP/240 ML
There is no simpler fruit sauce than raspberry coulis, yet
it’s completely compelling thanks to its fuchsia color and
perfumed, sweet-tart ﬂavor . If you’re lucky enough to go
raspberry picking this summer , make a triple batch of the
sauce and freeze what you don’t use right away .
Drizzle this iconic coulis over ice cream, pour a ribbon
around a slice of lemon tart, swirl it with whipped cream
and lemon curd to make an instant parfait, or use it to
dress up a slice of ﬂourless chocolate cake.
8 oz/225 g fr esh or thawed fr ozen raspber ries
Confectioners’ sugar
Fresh lemon juice
In a food processor or blender , whiz the berries until just
shy of smooth (aside from the raspberry seeds). Add 2 tsp
sugar and pulse to mix. T aste the sauce and add more
sugar , if necessary . Add a few drops of lemon juice and
taste again. Y ou want the sauce to be sweet but not cloying,
so tinker with the sugar and lemon until you have a nice
balance. Serve the sauce as is or strain out the seeds using
a ﬁne-mesh sieve.
