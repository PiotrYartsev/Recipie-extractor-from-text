 
SALTED CARAMEL SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 1 1/2 CUPS/360 ML
Not so long ago, salted caramel was a novelty . But now that
people have had a chance to taste how a pinch of salt
elevates and adds complexity to caramel, it’s become the
new standard. If you’re skeptical, start with a bit less salt
than the recipe calls for and add more to taste.
1 cup/200 g granulated sugar
3 tbsp water
3/4 cup/180 ml heavy cr eam or cr ème fraîche
1 tbsp unsalted butter
1/2 tsp k osher salt
1/4 tsp pur e vanilla e xtract
In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and
water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring
just until the sugar is moistened. Let the mixture boil,
without stirring but with an occasional swirl of the pan,
until it is a deep amber , smells like caramel, and you can
see just the tiniest wisps of smoke, 9 to 12 minutes. The
caramel will be very hot at this point. Remove the saucepan
from the heat and carefully add a little bit of the cream; the
caramel will bubble up furiously .
