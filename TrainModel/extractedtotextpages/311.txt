Everyone needs a dessert like this in his or her repertoire.
This cake is about as easy to make as a batch of brownies,
but the results are more delicate and reﬁned—a lovely
ending to a dinner party . Use the best-quality chocolate you
can ﬁnd because the cake is all about chocolate. I use
Valrhona or Michel Cluizel when I feel like splurging. The
sauce is simultaneously rich and light, a subtle supporting
player to the drama of the chocolate. I like the fudgy
texture the cake develops after a day in the fridge (it will
need at least an hour to come to room temperature before
serving, so plan accordingly), but it is also delicious still
warm from the oven and a little fragile.
