Kosher salt
In a small frying pan, combine the bread cubes, garlic, and
4 tbsp/60 ml of the oil over medium heat. Cook, stirring
frequently , until the bread is lightly browned, about 5
minutes. Using a heat-resistant rubber spatula, transfer the
bread to a food processor , scraping out as much oil as
possible.
Return the pan to medium-high heat. Add the tomato, cut-
side down, and cook without moving it until browned, 3 to
5 minutes. Flip and lightly brown the skin side, about 3
minutes. Remove from the heat and chop coarsely when
cool enough to handle.
Add the nuts, thyme, paprika, and cayenne to the processor
and process with the bread until ground and evenly
combined, about 30 seconds, stopping as needed to scrape
down the sides of the work bowl. Add the peppers, tomato,
and vinegar and process until thoroughly blended, about 30
seconds. T aste and adjust the seasoning with salt and
cayenne if needed. Finally , add the remaining 2 tbsp olive
oil and pulse brieﬂy just until combined.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3
days. The sauce does not fr eeze well.
QUICK CHANGE  Use all almonds, or even salted, fried
Marcona almonds for an e xtra-rich touch.
