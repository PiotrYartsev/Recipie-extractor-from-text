 
SOUR CREAM–HOT FUDGE SAUCE
MAKES 2 CUPS/480 ML
Glossy , thick, and almost chewy , this fudge sauce diﬀers
from my other chocolate sauces because it is made with
quite a bit of sugar and corn syrup as well as chocolate,
which gives it that classic fudgy texture. I use both
unsweetened chocolate and dark chocolate to keep the
sugar level in check, and I ﬁnish with a big dollop of sour
cream for a little bit of tang and a lush richness. If you
don’t have sour cream, you could use crème fraîche or
heavy cream.
This is the sauce for the classic sundae, with whipped
cream and a cherry on top, but it is also wonderful on less
obvious desserts: a slice of banana pound cake, chocolate
chip bread pudding, or a wedge of pecan tart.
