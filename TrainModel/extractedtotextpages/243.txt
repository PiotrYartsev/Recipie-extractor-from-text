 
CLASSIC (BUT LEMONY) HOLLANDAISE
MAKES ABOUT 1 CUP/240 ML
The classic sauce is incredibly delicate in ﬂavor . I prefer a
slightly zingier version, however , so I amp up the ﬂavor
here with lemon juice and lemon zest. If you’re lucky
enough to have your own hens or to buy eggs at a farmers’
market, this sauce is the perfect destination for them. A
yolk from a standard large supermarket egg weighs about
2/3 ounce/18 grams, so if your farm egg yolks are smaller
than that, add another half a yolk or so .
6 oz/170 g unsalted butter
2 egg yolks
1 tbsp fr esh lemon juice, plus mor e if needed
1 tbsp water
Kosher salt
1/2 tsp lightly pack ed ﬁnely grated lemon zest
In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
Don’t stir as it melts. Y ou want the milky solids to fall to the
bottom and the butterfat to ﬂoat to the top. K eep warm.
Pour water to a depth of 1 to 2 in/2.5 to 5 cm into a medium
saucepan and place over medium heat. Rest a medium
stainless-steel bowl in the pan over (not touching) the
