Cook, whisking a lot, for about 1 minute. This will give the
ﬂour a nutty , rather than ﬂoury , ﬂavor .
Pull the pan oﬀ the heat and pour in about 1/4 cup/60 ml of
the milk. Whisk like crazy to form a smooth paste, then
whisk in the remaining 1 cup/240 ml milk and the cream.
Return the pan to medium-high heat and bring to a simmer ,
whisking frequently and making sure to get into the angles
of the pan where the thick roux can accumulate.
Simmer , giving the sauce an occasional whisk, until smooth
and glossy and no taste of ﬂour remains, 8 to 10 minutes.
As it simmers, be sure to scrape down the sides of the pan
where the sauce builds up and whisk into the sauce;
otherwise you will end up with lumps.
Add the salt, several grinds of pepper , and the nutmeg,
then taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve right away or
keep warm over low heat.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3
days. The sauce does not fr eeze well.
QUICK CHANGE  Add 1/4 yellow onion and 1 fr esh thyme
sprig af ter whisking in the milk and cr eam. R emove befor e
serving.
