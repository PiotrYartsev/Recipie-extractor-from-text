Kosher salt and fr eshly gr ound black pepper
1/2 cup/55 g grated P armigiano -Reggiano cheese
In a small saucepan, bring the tomato sauce to a simmer
over mediumhigh heat. Cook, stirring often, until very
concentrated and thick, about 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a medium, heavy saucepan, melt the butter
over mediumhigh heat until foamy . Add the onion and cook,
stirring often, until very soft and fragrant but not browned,
4 to 5 minutes. Add the rice and cook, stirring constantly ,
until coated with the fat and glistening, 1 to 2 minutes
more.
Stir in the wine and simmer , stirring, until evaporated, 1 to
2 minutes. Stir in about 1/2 cup/120 ml of the hot broth.
Adjust the heat so the liquid bubbles merrily and cook,
scraping the bottom of the pan frequently , until the broth is
almost entirely evaporated. Continue adding broth about
1/2 cup/120 ml at a time, stirring frequently and cooking
until the broth is almost entirely evaporated before adding
more, until the rice is tender but still slightly ﬁrm at the
center and it is in a creamy matrix of starchy broth, about
20 minutes more. When the rice is almost done, add the
broth in smaller amounts and taste as you go so you don’t
overcook the rice.
When the risotto is tender , season with salt and pepper .
Divide evenly among warmed wide, shallow bowls and
make a well in the center of each serving. Ladle some of
the hot tomato sauce into each well and sprinkle with the
cheese. Serve right away .
