 
CARAMELIZED ONION COULIS
MAKES 1 1/2 CUPS/360 ML
Onions are a beautiful vegetable to transform into a sauce
because their ﬂavor is sweet and their texture is silky and
melting. They won’t get that way , however , if you don’t give
them enough time to caramelize slowly , so don’t rush the
cooking and be sure they don’t brown too quickly .
2 tbsp unsalted butter
11/2 lb/680 g onions, thinly sliced
1/2 tsp k osher salt
1 fresh r osemary sprig, 4 in/10 cm long
1/4 cup/60 ml cr ème fraîche, plus mor e if needed
1/2 cup/120 ml homemade turkey br oth, chick en or
vegetable br oth, or canned r educed-sodium chick en or
vegetable br oth
1 tsp fr esh lemon juice, plus mor e if needed
Freshly gr ound black pepper
In a large, heavy frying pan, melt the butter over medium-
high heat. Add the onions and salt and stir to mix. Once the
onions start to steam and sizzle a bit, cover the pan, reduce
the heat to medium, and cook until the onions are starting
to get juicy and soft, about 10 minutes.
