PASTA with SPRING VEGETABLES in
LIGHT, LEMONY CREAM SAUCE
SERVES 4 AS A FIRST COURSE OR 2 AS A MAIN COURSE
A handful of dishes make up my core repertoire—the ones I
can make in my sleep, which are ﬂexible enough to deal
with whatever’s in the fridge or garden, and are endlessly
satisfying. This pasta is one of those dishes. I call for spring
vegetables here, but you can use whatever you like, as long
as the vegetables aren’t too watery , such as tomatoes. And
here’s a case where the trick of ﬁnishing the pasta with a
bit of cooking water is crucial—the starchy water emulsiﬁes
with the added cheese to give the dish the right amount of
sloppy , but not gloppy , creaminess, so please don’t skip it.
