 
RICH DARK CHOCOLATE SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 1 CUP/240 ML
This is an excellent all-purpose sauce, and I ﬁrmly believe
that it belongs in your fridge at all times. I use a basic
ganache method to make it: I pour hot cream over chopped
chocolate and then whisk until smooth. But I enhance the
sauce with some corn syrup to punch up the sweetness and
make it slightly thicker . I also ﬁnish it with some butter
because it makes the texture lush and balances the acidity
of the chocolate.
1 cup/240 ml heavy cr eam
1 tbsp light cor n syrup
4 oz/115 g dark chocolate, chopped
2 tbsp unsalted butter
Pinch of k osher salt
In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the cream and corn
syrup and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Do not
allow the mixture to boil, which will give the cream a
“cooked” taste. Remove from the heat and whisk in the
chocolate, a few pieces at a time, until blended and smooth.
If the cream cools oﬀ too much to melt the chocolate,
return the sauce to low heat for a few seconds. Whisk in
