A Step-by-Step Guide to Doughs and Folds 31313. If using store-bought wrappers, dip the tip of your index finger into the slurry 
and moisten the edge of the wrapper all the way around.
4. With your nondominant hand, pick up the wrapper and pinch the edge with your 
thumb and index finger at the 12 o'clock position. While cupping the dumpling 
in your palm, gently hold the top edge of the wrapper with your thumb and 
index finger. 
5. Using your dominant thumb and index finger, hold the same edge 2 inches away 
from the place you’re already holding it.
6. Gently stretch the wrapper a tiny bit with your free hand, then fold the stretched 
edge over itself, making a pleat. Pinch to seal.
7. Continue making pleats around the dumpling; the pleats will come together, 
forming a circle, and the wrapper will form a cup. It’s okay if you have to stretch 
the wrapper a bit to keep pleating.
8. When you have completed pleating around the entire circumference of the 
wrapper, gather the pleated edges together and twist, pinching them into a little 
top knot. Grasp the top knot and lift the dumpling up, letting it suspend briefly 
to stretch the shape into a pouch. This helps create that classic soup dumpling 
shape when steamed.
