In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk, egg yolks,
lemon juice, and lemon zest until blended. In another
medium bowl, whisk together the ﬂour , 1 cup/200 g of the
sugar , and the salt. Whisk the dry ingredients into the wet
ingredients until blended.
In a stand mixer ﬁtted with the whisk attachment, or with a
large bowl and a handheld electric mixer , beat the egg
whites on medium-high speed until foamy and white, about
1 minute. W ith the mixer running, slowly add the remaining
1/4 cup/50 g sugar , a little at a time, beating until fully
incorporated, and then continue to beat until the whites are
glossy and hold medium-ﬁrm peaks, about 4 minutes more.
Whisk about one-fourth of the egg whites into the cake
batter to lighten it. Then, using a rubber spatula, gently
fold the remaining egg whites into the batter just until no
white streaks are visible. P our the batter into the prepared
baking dish.
Place the cake in the oven and immediately reduce the
oven temperature to 300°F/150°C/gas 2. Bake until puﬀed
and slightly dry on the top but still soft inside (the cake will
wiggle when you shake the dish), 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool
on a rack until barely warm, then scoop into dessert bowls
and serve with the blueberry sauce.
