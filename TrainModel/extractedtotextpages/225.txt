 
AVOCADO-LIME MAYONNAISE
MAKES ABOUT 1 1/2 CUPS/340 ML
This recipe is doubly rich, with puréed avocado taking the
place of some of the oil. And although it’s not a low-fat
sauce by any means, the fats in avocado are so beneﬁcial
that I think it’s safe to consider this jade green sauce a
health food.
1 ripe avocado, halved, pitted, peeled, and cut into about 8
pieces
2 tbsp fr esh lime juice, plus mor e if needed
2 egg yolks
Kosher salt
1 cup/240 ml avocado, canola, grapeseed, or mild e xtra-
virgin olive oil, or a mixtur e
1 tsp lightly pack ed ﬁnely grated lime zest
In a small bowl, toss the avocado with 2 tsp of the lime
juice to prevent browning; set aside.
In a food processor , combine the egg yolks, the remaining 4
tsp lime juice, and 1/2 tsp salt and pulse until well blended.
The yolks will likely be sprayed on the sides of the bowl, so
scrape them down with a rubber spatula. W ith the motor
running, begin adding the oil in a very slow stream. Y ou
