In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water and
bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the
sugar is dissolved. Cook for about 1 minute more, then
remove from the heat. Add the mint, pushing the leaves
into the syrup until they are submerged, and let steep for
about 30 minutes. T aste the syrup, and if it’s nicely minty ,
remove and discard the mint; otherwise, letit steep longer ,
up to 1 hour . After that, the syrup will taste too vegetal.
In a food processor or blender , whiz the mango until
smooth. Add about 3 tbsp of the mint syrup and process
until very smooth. Add the lime juice and salt and then
taste and tinker with the balance of ﬂavors by adding more
lime juice or syrup as needed. If the sauce seems ﬁbrous,
push it through a ﬁne-mesh sieve.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5
days or fr eeze for up to 2 months.
QUICK CHANGE  Use fr esh basil leaves instead of mint.
