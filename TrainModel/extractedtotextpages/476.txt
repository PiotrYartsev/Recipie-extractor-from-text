The Basics: a really useful cookB ook 488Problem solving
* Leftover egg yolks? Try hard not to break the yolks and place them in a glass or bowl. 
Cover with a bit of cold water and refrigerate for up to 3 days. I suggest making a 
mayonnaise or fresh custard. Leftover egg yolks can be frozen but will be gummy and unusable unless you add a pinch of salt or sugar before freezing. Label your yolks ‘savoury’ or ‘sweet’, depending on which you added, then defrost in the refrigerator before using as you would a fresh yolk.
* Leftover egg whites? Store in the freezer. Wash and thoroughly dry an empty plastic 
container with a screw-top lid. Add leftover egg whites and freeze. Continue to add whites until 2 cm from the top. Don’t forget to date the container, as whites will be at their best in the freezer for up to 3 months. Use egg whites for meringues and pavlovas. The problem then becomes one of volume, not numbers. Where a recipe asks for 3 egg whites, you now have a cupful at your disposal. As a guide, the white of one 55–65 g egg weighs 25–35 g. In other words, a little under half the weight of the entire egg is the white. 
* Dirty eggs? Wipe with a dry cloth. If you wash an egg, it will become even more 
vulnerable to absorbing fridge odours.
* Stuck to the carton? Wet the carton and the egg will come out with ease.
* How do I tell if it’s fresh? A fresh egg will sink when placed in water (unless it has 
been damaged). An egg that floats has lost moisture, which has been replaced by air in the blunt, fat end of the egg. The white of a fresh egg clings to the yolk when the egg is cracked onto a plate and the chalazae—(pronounced Kuh-Lay-zee) the two strands of connective tissue attached to the yolk which extend to either end of the shell’s membrane and anchor the yolk in the centre of the egg—is prominent. Also, egg white becomes more transparent as the egg ages (caused by the slow escape of carbon dioxide); fresh eggs have a cloudier white.
* Separating eggs and there’s eggshell shrapnel or egg yolk in the whites? Remove with 
an empty half eggshell. If a lot of yolk has managed to infiltrate the white, keep it for scrambled egg and start again. 
* Separating eggs and there’s egg white in the yolk? Don’t worry. It is highly unlikely 
that the white will affect the further use of the yolk. 
* Undercooked boiled eggs? If they’re still quite raw in the centre, peel all eggs, mash 
them together and quickly sauté in a bit of butter in a pan on the stove, just until the yolks have set. Cool immediately and use in sandwiches or eat while hot as a form of scrambled egg. 
* Curdled fresh egg custard? Take to it with an electric mixer. The sauce will now be 
fluffier and a little thinner than intended, but still usable.
* Collapsed soufflé? A collapsing soufflé is known as the ‘double deflation method’—as you 
helplessly watch the soufflé plunge below the rim of its receptacle, you witness too the deflation of your culinary ego. Turn the soufflé out of the mould and onto a baking tray. Place the turned out soufflé back in the hot oven for another minute or 2 and called it ‘twice-baked soufflé’. Although it will not rise the second time around, this dense, eggy pudding will have a more concentrated flavour. Serve it on a plate garnished with sauce or ice-cream or both. 
* Egg stuck to the dishes? Always use cold water to wash dishes with egg stuck to them. Hot 
water will only cook the egg onto the plate.
