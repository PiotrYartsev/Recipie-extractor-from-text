Fruit sauces don’t require mastering tricky techniques. Y ou
just need to make some decisions: raw or cooked, chunky
or smooth, sweet or tart.
On the raw side, the simplest fruit sauce is a coulis
(pronounced koo-LEE), which is a purée of raw fruit, most
often berries. Depending on the ﬂavor of the fruit, adjust
the balance of sweet and tart with sugar and citrus of some
kind. If the fruit is quite seedy , such as blackberries, you
can strain the seeds out. W ith a moderately seedy fruit,
such as raspberries, the choice is yours. The sauce will be a
touch rustic with the seeds, reﬁned and elegant without.
On the cooked side, heat transforms the ﬂavor , texture, and
color of fruit into something deeper . What you lose in
freshness, you gain in complexity and intensity . Blueberries
and plums are my favorite fruits for cooked sauces because
they undergo a personality makeover , becoming almost
spicy with shiny , viscous juices.
For a cooked sauce, the choice is the same: leave it chunky
or purée it so that it’s smooth. As with a coulis, if the fruit
is seedy , I always purée and then strain it. But with
something like a plum, which breaks down into lush and
tender chunks, I sometimes leave the sauce as is—hovering
between sauce and compote.
To turn fruit into a savory sauce, I generally keep most of
the sweet ingredients intact, but incorporate onion or
shallot, some type of spicy heat (fresh or dried chiles), and
more tang and salt.

FIX IT?
