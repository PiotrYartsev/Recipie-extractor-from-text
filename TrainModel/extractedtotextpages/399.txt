the heat and let sit for 30 minutes, gently pressing on the
ginger with the back of a spoon a few times. Stir in the
coconut milk and salt, return to medium heat, and bring to
a gentle simmer , stirring often to dissolve the syrup on the
sides of the pan.
Put the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl and set a
Ô¨Åne-mesh sieve over it. Strain the coconut milk mixture
through the sieve into the chocolate. Leave undisturbed for
about 1 minute to melt the chocolate, then start whisking in
small circles in the center of the bowl, widening your
whisking toward the outer edges of the bowl as the sauce
becomes glossy and smooth. T aste and add a touch more
sugar to balance the spices if needed. Serve warm or at
room temperature.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 2
weeks or fr eeze for up to 2 months. If making the sauce
ahead, very gently r eheat it in a saucepan to loosen it up,
adding 2 to 3 tsp very hot water if needed to thin it out.
QUICK CHANGE  Add 1 gr een or white car damom pod,
crushed, to the sugar syrup with the other spices.
