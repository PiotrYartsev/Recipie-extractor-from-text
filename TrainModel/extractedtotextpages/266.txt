1 to 1 1/2 cups/240 to 360 ml broth, depending on how
much you need to reduce to achieve good ﬂavor
Because I like having leftover gravy , which I use in all
kinds of dishes , my goal is always to make as much
gravy as my pan drippings and broth supply will
allow .
HOW ’S THE CONSISTENCY?  Too thick? Add more broth.
Too thin? Simmer the gravy a little longer to concentrate
and thicken it. Alternatively , thicken it by working in a
slurry or beurre manié . Lumpy? A t the end of cooking, you
can put it through a ﬁne-mesh sieve.
HOW ’S THE FLA VOR? You’ll probably need to season with
salt, unless the drippings were highly salted, which might
be the case if the roast was brined or you used a canned
broth that was salty . How’s the meatiness? Is there enough
depth of ﬂavor? Y ou can heighten the ﬂavor by simmering
the gravy to reduce and concentrate it. Be careful you don’t
cook oﬀ all of your volume, however , and end up with a
spoonful of gravy .
If the juices were not suﬀiciently plentiful to give the gravy
enough savoriness, it is ﬁne to cheat. In fact, I encourage
it. If you have some homemade broth, reduce it until it is
powerfully concentrated and then add it to the gravy . (This
isn’t really cheating, of course, because the broth was
made from scratch.) If you do not have homemade broth,
use canned reduced-sodium chicken broth from the pantry .
Another option is a packaged demi-glace, such as More
Than Gourmet’s glace de poulet for poultry or glace de
viande for meats. These are hard pastes that you dilute
with water . I add a few teaspoons to the gravy and then
taste.
