BUTTER SAUCES
BEURRE BLANC , OR “ WHITE BUT TER,” MA Y BE THE
POSTER CHILD FOR MISUNDERSTOOD FRENCH
SAUCES . It has a reputation for being tricky to make,
ﬁnicky to serve, and richer than what most modern diners
like to eat. But I am here to tell you none of that is true. A
butter sauce is one of the easiest sauces to master , and
while it is indeed buttery—it’s a butter sauce, after all—you
don’t need to ﬂood your dish with it. A generous drizzle is
usually plenty .
A well-made butter sauce has an exquisite ﬂavor tension
between acid and butter . The sauce tastes at once bright
and mellow , tangy and rich. It’s a dynamic and compelling
combination. In other words, I often ﬁnd myself eating a
spoonful directly from the saucepan.
I also like the process of making this sauce. It is a beautiful
thing to watch as hunks of cold butter relax into a creamy ,
satiny liquid. Indeed, it makes you feel like a genius cook.
Beurre blanc is a classic accompaniment to ﬁsh dishes or to
mild vegetables such as asparagus, and that is generally
how I use it. But some of my gutsier butter sauces, such as
Soy-Ginger Butter Sauce , Balsamic Beurre Rouge , or
Orange-Rosemary Balsamic Butter Sauce , pair well with
pork and beef , too.
