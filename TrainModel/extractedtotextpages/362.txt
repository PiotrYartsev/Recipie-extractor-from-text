 
GINGER CARAMEL SAUCE
MAKES 1 1/2 CUPS/360 ML
I prefer to use fresh ginger (rather than ground) in this
sauce because its ﬂavor is more complex: you get spicy
heat, as you would with ground ginger , but you get also
bright, citrus notes. This sauce is delicious paired with
anything with apples.
1 cup/240 ml heavy cr eam
11/2 tbsp peeled and ﬁnely grated fr esh ginger
1 cup/200 g granulated sugar
1/4 cup/60 ml water
2 tbsp unsalted butter
1/8 tsp k osher salt
In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the cream and ginger
and bring just to a simmer over medium-high heat. Remove
from the heat and let the cream infuse for 20 to 30
minutes. T aste the cream, and if it isn’t gingery enough, let
it sit for another few minutes. Strain through a ﬁne-mesh
sieve into a bowl, pressing gently on the solids to extract
the ginger ﬂavor (press too hard and the cream will have a
vegetal taste).
