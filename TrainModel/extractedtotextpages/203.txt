 
WILD MUSHROOM CREAM SAUCE
MAKES 3/4 CUP/180 ML
This sauce is lovely on poached chicken breasts served with
rice and a green vegetable, a meal that recalls old-
fashioned hotel restaurant food. It’s also beautiful with veal
meatballs. I usually strain the sauce, but it’s luscious with
the mushrooms left in, too .

mushr ooms
