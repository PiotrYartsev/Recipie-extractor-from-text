The humble eggplant can transform into a fantastic dumpling filling with the help of the 
umami-rich black bean sauce. This recipe calls for water chestnuts for some crunch, but you 
can use bamboo shoots or celery instead.
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 medium eggplant, cut into 
1/ 4-inch cubes
Pinch kosher salt
1/2 medium onion, 
finely chopped
1 (4-ounce) can water 
chestnuts, drained and 
roughly chopped
1/ 4 cup black bean sauce
2 scallions, white and green 
parts, minced
1 batch Basic Dumpling 
Dough (page 20)
Nonstick cooking spray
Mix it uP: Make a spicier 
dumpling by adding 2 teaspoons 
Chili Crisp Sauce (page 99) to 
the filling.1. Make the filling: In a skillet over medium-high heat, 
heat the vegetable oil. Swirl to coat the skillet and 
add the eggplant. Sauté for 1 minute, then add the 
salt and onion. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the 
eggplant becomes golden.
2. Stir in the water chestnuts and black bean sauce. 
Remove from the heat and let cool. Stir in the scal-
lions and transfer the filling to a medium bowl to cool.
3. Roll out the wrappers and fold the dumplings: Cut 
the dough into 24 pieces (see page 24). Roll each 
piece into a 4-inch circle about 1/16 inch thick around 
the edges. Keep covered.
4. Lay 6 wrappers on a cutting board and place 
1 tablespoon of filling in the center of each.
5. Fold the dumplings using the Basic Half-Moon Fold 
(see page 26).  Repeat with the remaining wrappers 
and filling.
6. Cook and serve: In a 10-inch-wide stockpot or wok, 
bring 4 cups water to a boil.  Reduce the heat to 
medium to keep a simmer.
7. Lightly coat the bottoms of two steamer baskets 
with cooking spray. Arrange the dumplings in the 
steamer baskets, leaving at least 1 inch of space 
between each.
