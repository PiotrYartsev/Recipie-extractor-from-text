99 Ranch Market (99Ranch.com): There are 51 stores across seven states special-
izing in Chinese groceries and products. Here, you can buy proteins, seafood, dry 
goods, spices, condiments, fresh noodles, and produce. They even have an online 
shop where you can order items to be shipped to you if there isn’t a store near you.
Amazon (Amazon.com): Y ou can buy virtually any piece of equipment or pantry 
ingredient needed for dumplings on Amazon.
H Mart (Hmart.com): With 71 locations nationwide, this Korean American super -
market chain carries pan-Asian produce and imported goods, including Korean and 
Chinese staples. 
Sur La Table (SurLaT able.com): I mentioned that my favorite nonstick skillets and 
woks are the ceramic titanium nonstick pans made by Scanpan. Made in Denmark 
from 100 percent recycled aluminum, these are investment pieces and indispens-
able for all kinds of cooking, not just for making dumplings. Sur La T able has been 
selling top quality kitchenware since 1972 and is the largest seller of Scanpan prod-
ucts in the United States.
The Wok Shop (WokShop.com/newstore): A local favorite in San Francisco’s China-
town, it is a shop jam-crammed full of woks, steamer baskets, spiders, and everything 
else you need for making dumplings. Visit in person, if you can, or online.
