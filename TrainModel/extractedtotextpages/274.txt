JUS
My deﬁnition of a jus is a sauce made by dissolving pan
juices with another liquid. It could be as elemental as
boiling a little water in the bottom of your roasting pan, or
it can be a more complex jus for which you sauté an
aromatic vegetable ﬁrst, deglaze the pan with a wine or
spirit, add broth, and ﬁnish with a little cream.
