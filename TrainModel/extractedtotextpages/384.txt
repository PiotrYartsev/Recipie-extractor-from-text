another point. Thicker slabs of chocolate can be tricky , and
you will deﬁnitely need a sturdy chef ’s knife or a heavy
serrated knife for them. Y ou can use an oyster knife or
other short, stiﬀ -bladed knife to cut oﬀ a chunk from the
larger slab: insert it into the chocolate about 2 inches/5
centimeters from the edge and then pull to crack oﬀ a
chunk. Then chop that chunk and repeat.
You can use your food processor , too, but if you have
already cut your chocolate into pieces small enough to ﬁt
into the processor , you might as well ﬁnish the job by hand.
For the recipes in this book, you don’t need the chocolate
to be chopped more ﬁnely than, say , the size of an almond.
HOW MUCH SAUCE PER SERVING?
