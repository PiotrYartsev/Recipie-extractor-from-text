The Basics: a really useful cookB ook 508wastage so, to lengthen storage time, divide into 3 smaller bunches, wrap each in plastic 
wrap and keep in the fridge. In many parts of the world, the misnomer ‘scallions’ or ‘shallots’ is used to describe spring onions. 
White onions are sharper and spicier than brown onions but lack their big, rounded 
flavour. Their tang makes them a popular choice in Hispanic cooking.
Pasta 
Pasta is often made with durum wheat (semolina) flour (see Flour) because of its high protein content (15 per cent, too high for successful bread-making). The protein forms strong gluten strands which help the dough retain elasticity when it is extruded through the pasta machine. Pasta made with soft wheat flour is usually mixed with eggs to reinforce the dough, which is not necessary with the strong durum flour. However, eggs can be added to any flour for a richer pasta (pasta all’uovo). Experiment with hen’s or duck eggs, starting with 1 egg for every 200 g flour.
Some brands of dried pasta (pasta asciutta) can be just as good if not better than 
fresh pasta (pasta fresca). Dried pasta has a shelf life of up to 2 years. Fresh pasta is best used immediately or stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. It may also be stored in a cupboard for up to a month but obviously will dry out in that time.
Tips for cooking pasT a:
* 500 g (1 lb) dried pasta will give the same cooked volume as 750 g (11/2 lb) fresh.
* The size of a single serve varies, of course, but a good starting point is 100 g dried or 
150 g fresh per person.
* Al dente translates as ‘to the tooth’. When a recipe asks for something to be cooked al 
dente, that doesn’t mean the food should be as hard as a tooth, but rather that it is cooked 
through while still firm to the bite. Al dente usually refers to cooking pasta or rice, but can sometimes be used to describe other cooked foods. 
* The most important thing is to use plenty of boiling, salted water: 1 litre plus a very 
generous pinch of salt for every serve (100 g) of pasta. Salt is important, as it brings out the flavour of the pasta. (Obviously, you’ll make your own judgement if you are trying to reduce your salt intake.)
* Fresh pasta should be ready in 2–3 minutes, gnocchi are ready when they rise to the top, 
and dried pasta is ready in 5–12 minutes, depending on the type (follow the instructions on the packet). I like to undercook the pasta and then finish cooking it in the sauce.
* Adding oil to pasta water is absolutely not necessary. With the exception of fresh 
lasagne sheets, pasta does not benefit from the addition of oil. The real secret to stopping it sticking together is to stir the pasta for the first 2 minutes after adding it to the pot. Move the pasta around the pot with a wooden spoon, this allows the water to cook the outer part of the pasta, making it slippery, not a starchy glue.
* Once it is cooked, drain the pasta, setting some of the cooking water aside as this can 
be used to thin pasta sauces if stock is not available.
* Never rinse pasta in water after draining as this washes away the natural sticky starches 
that help the sauce stick.
* If you are keeping the pasta for later use, toss it in olive or vegetable oil after 
draining, then spread thinly on trays, allowing the pasta to cool quickly. To reheat, either drop it in boiling water for 10–15 seconds or microwave, covered, for 30 seconds.
