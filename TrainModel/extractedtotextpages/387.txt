this book, and I specify a cacao percentage only when it
is important for the recipe.
Chocolates with super-high cocoa percentages can
behave diﬀerently in baking than those with lower ones,
thanks to their correspondingly lower sugar contents.
Fortunately , we don’t have to worry much about that
when making sauces. F or sauces, it is easy to adapt to
various chocolates by simply tasting the sauce as you go:
Too bitter? Add another 1/2 teaspoon sugar . Too acidic or
sharp? Add more cream or butter .
Be sure to distinguish between bittersweet and
unsweetened chocolate, however . Unsweetened chocolate
contains no sugar at all and is used only in baking. The
exception is the remarkable 99 percent cacao chocolate
from Michel Cluizel. Nibbling on a bar of his
unsweetened chocolate is like enjoying a shot of perfectly
pulled espresso: strong and bitter but complex and
enjoyable nonetheless.
And please don’t forget milk chocolate! Although it has
recently been overshadowed by all of the interest in
intensely dark chocolates, a good milk chocolate can be
sublime. FDA standards are minimal—just 10 percent
chocolate liquor and 12 percent milk solids—but the
better brands have higher chocolate-liquor contents,
making them a valid chocolate experience. Scharﬀen
Berger milk chocolate at 41 percent is yummy , though my
favorite is Bonnat, a French producer who makes three
varieties of milk chocolate with 65 percent cacao . The
texture of Bonnat makes me swoon.
