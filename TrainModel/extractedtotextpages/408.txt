chocolate, you’ll end up with a lumpy texture, rather than
the desired smooth, just-set creamy consistency .
1/4 cup/60 ml cold water
11/2 cups/360 ml cr ème fraîche or heavy cr eam
1 envelope (2 1/2 tsp) granulated unﬂavor ed gelatin
3/4 cup/150 g granulated sugar
Pinch of k osher salt

1 cup/240 ml Raspber ry Truﬄe Sauce , war med just until
ﬂuid
Pour the water in a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over
the top, and let sit for about 10 minutes so the gelatin
“blooms” and softens.
Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, combine 1/2 cup/120 ml
of the crème fraîche; the sugar , and salt and bring to a
simmer over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar .
Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the gelatin
mixture until completely dissolved and smooth. Stir in the
remaining crème fraîche and the yogurt.
Strain the mixture through a ﬁne-mesh sieve into a medium
bowl that will ﬁt in your fridge. Cover with plastic wrap and
chill, stirring occasionally , until the mixture thickens to the
consistency of pancake batter , about 45 minutes.
Meanwhile, lightly oil six 3/4-cup/180-ml ramekins or little
bowls; set aside.
