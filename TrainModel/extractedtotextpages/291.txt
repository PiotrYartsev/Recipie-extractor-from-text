Here are the elements of a
perfect August dinner party: a
deck, some friends, a cold bottle
(or three) of Grüner V eltliner ,
salumi, white beans in olive oil,
platters of grilled vegetables,
and.then these ﬁgs, cooked over
the slow warmth of the last
embers in the grill.
You can reduce the balsamic
ahead of time, but make the
sabayon at the last minute. It is a
fun sauce to make in front of an
audience, and you can get your friends to help with the
whisking.
1/2 cup/120 ml balsamic vinegar
18 to 24 ripe ﬁgs, halved lengthwise
2 tbsp canola or other neutral vegetable oil or a mild olive
oil
2 tbsp granulated sugar
11/4 cups/300 ml Classic Sabayon
6 to 8 amar etti, crumbled
In a small saucepan, bring the vinegar to a simmer over
medium heat. Cook until reduced by about half , 5 to 7
minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool completely .
Prepare a medium ﬁre in a charcoal or gas grill. Or ,
position an oven rack about 5 in/12 cm from the boiler
element and heat the broiler . If using a grill, the ﬁre is
ready when you can comfortably hold your hand, palm-side
down, 4 in/10 cm above the grill rack for 4 seconds. Brush
the grill rack so that it is perfectly clean.
