This vegan version of the classic wonton soup with Tofu and Carrot Wontons (page 43) calls 
for premade vegetable stock as the base, which is fortified with mushrooms and aromatics. 
If you can’t find mushroom soy sauce, just add more dried mushrooms to the soup.
4 cups vegetable stock
1/2 head Napa cabbage, cut 
into chunks
4 dried shiitake mushrooms
4-inch piece fresh ginger, 
slightly smashed
2 garlic cloves, 
slightly smashed
4 scallions, white and 
green parts separated, 
thickly sliced
Kosher salt
Mushroom soy sauce, for 
seasoning
1 batch cooked Tofu and 
Carrot Wontons (page 43)
2 tablespoons sesame oil
Mix it uP: You don’t have to 
stick to vegetarian wontons. 
Use this broth for pork wontons 
or wontons with any of the 
dumpling fillings in this book, 
if having a vegan dish is not a 
concern for you.1. In a medium stockpot, combine the vegetable stock, 
cabbage, mushrooms, ginger, garlic, and scallion 
whites. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the 
heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes, or 
until the mushrooms are rehydrated.
2. Using a slotted spoon, remove the mushrooms from 
the stock. T rim off the mushroom stems and thinly 
slice the caps. Set aside.
3. Line a fine-mesh strainer with cheesecloth, set it 
over a large saucepan, and strain the broth, dis-
carding the solids. Return the sliced mushrooms to 
the stock and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes. 
Season to taste with salt and mushroom soy sauce. 
4. Divide the cooked wontons and soup among 4 to 
6 warmed bowls. Garnish with sesame oil and the 
scallion greens to serve.
