15 Dumplings Made Simple How can I tell when the dumplings are cooked?
Boiled dumplings may float before they are fully cooked. Recipes that include raw 
ground meat in the filling call for boiling the dumplings, then adding cold water to 
bring the temperature down, then boiling the cooking water at least twice to ensure 
the filling is cooked through. T o make sure, sacrifice one dumpling and insert the 
probe of an instant-read thermometer into its thickest part. A fully cooked filling 
should be at least 165°F (74°C).
How to Use the Recipes
The recipes in this book focus on the most popular and beginner-friendly dumplings. 
Once you’ve mastered these recipes, experiment with more creative fillings and 
doughs. Start with the basic half-moon fold, or the wonton fold, before moving on to 
the more intricate pleated crescent or xiao long bao fold.
Chapter 2 includes three Master Dough recipes and folding instructions for five 
different classic dumpling shapes, including my favorite, the parcel fold! Chapters 3, 4, 
and 5 include instructions for making the fillings, plus cooking instructions for boiled, 
steamed, and pan-fried dumplings. Each recipe in chapters 3, 4, and 5 calls for one of 
the Master Dough recipes and one of the folding instructions provided in chapter 2. 
Chapter 6 covers soups, sauces, and other dumpling accompaniments.
Each dumpling recipe also features Cooking Tips to help with preparation. Make 
It Easier tips offer ideas for saving time or effort, and Mix It Up tips show you how to 
create new versions of a classic dumpling.
My hope is that this book will help you feel confident making dumplings at home. 
Pick your favorite dumpling and cook it several times to master it. Make notes on the 
pages to remind yourself what worked, and what you want to do differently next time. 
I hope you enjoy making dumplings at home and delight your friends and family with 
your new skills and creations!
