Slide the crepe from the pan onto a large plate or cooling
rack. Repeat with the remaining batter , adjusting the heat
and spreading the pan with more butter as you cook. As
each crepe is ﬁnished, stack it on top of the previous one.
You should end up with eight crepes. The crepes will soften
as they cool.
TO MAKE THE FILLING , in a small bowl, combine the
ricotta, confectioners’ sugar , ﬂour , orange zest, vanilla, and
salt and stir with a fork just until blended. Do not overmix
or you will lose the ﬂuﬀiness of the ricotta. Stir in the egg.
Heat the oven to 400°F/200°C/gas 6. Use 1 tbsp of the
butter to grease the bottom of a 9-by-13-in/23-by-33-cm
baking dish.
Lay the crepes, prettiest-side down, on a clean work
surface. Spoon about 2 tbsp of the ﬁlling onto the center of
each crepe, then spread the ﬁlling into a 3-by-1-in/7.5-by-
2.5-cm oval. F old the bottom and top edges of each crepe
up to enclose the ﬁlling, and then fold in both sides to
create neat, ﬂattish rectangular blintzes about 3 1/2 in/9 cm
long.
In a large frying pan, melt about 2 tsp of the remaining
butter over medium heat. When the butter is hot, arrange
as many blintzes, seam-side up, in the pan as will ﬁt in a
single layer . Cook until the underside of each blintze is
golden, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until golden on the
second side, another 2 minutes. Transfer the blintzes to the
prepared baking dish. Repeat with any remaining blintzes
and butter .
Put the baking dish in the oven and bake until the blintzes
are slightly puﬀed, the ﬁlling is heated through, and the
bottoms are slightly crisp, 7 to 10 minutes.
