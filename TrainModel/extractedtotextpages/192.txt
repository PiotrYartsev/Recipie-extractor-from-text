Cook, whisking a lot, for about 1 minute. This will give the
ﬂour a nutty , rather than ﬂoury , ﬂavor .
Pull the pan oﬀ the heat and pour in about 1/4 cup/60 ml of
the broth. Whisk like crazy until smooth, then whisk in the
remaining 3 3/4 cups/900 ml broth.
Return the pan to medium-high heat and bring to a simmer ,
whisking frequently and making sure to get into the angles
of the pan where the thick roux can accumulate. Simmer ,
giving the sauce an occasional whisk, until reduced by
about one-quarter and the sauce is smooth and glossy , 15 to
20 minutes. As it simmers, be sure to scrape down the
sides of the pan where the sauce builds up and whisk into
the sauce; otherwise you will end up with lumps.
Add the cream and simmer for 1 minute more, then season
with salt and pepper . Serve right away or keep warm over
low heat.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5
days. The sauce does not fr eeze well.
QUICK CHANGE  Add 2 tbsp dry sher ry with the cr eam and
simmer for an e xtra 2 or 3 minutes to cook oﬀ the alcohol.
