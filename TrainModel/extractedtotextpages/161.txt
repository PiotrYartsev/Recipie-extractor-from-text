Using a rasp-type grater , ﬁnely grate 1 tsp zest from the
grapefruit and set the zest aside. Cut a slice oﬀ each end of
the grapefruit to reveal the ﬂesh. Stand the grapefruit on a
ﬂat end on a work surface. Using a sharp knife, slice away
the peel, including all of the white pith, cutting from the
top to the bottom and following the contour of the fruit.
Take your time and work in wide strips. If any white pith
remains, just slice it oﬀ .
Cut out half of the grapefruit segments by holding the fruit
in one hand and cutting along both sides of each segment
to release it from the membrane, until you’ve worked your
way around half of the fruit. Chop the segments into 1/4 -
in/6-mm pieces; set aside.
Holding the unsegmented grapefruit half over a small
saucepan, squeeze the juice from it into the pan. Y ou
should have about 1/2 cup/120 ml (you can also add any
juice that has accumulated from the segments). Add the
vinegar and shallot to the pan and bring to a simmer over
medium-high heat. Cook, stirring and scraping the sides of
the pan occasionally with a heat-resistant rubber spatula,
until the liquid is reduced to about 2 tbsp, 6 to 8 minutes.
Add the butter and start stirring it around in circles with a
whisk, a fork, a wooden spoon, or anything that lets you
“stab” the hunk of butter so that you can move it around
easily . The butter will start to melt and the mixture will
bubble and boil around the edges. The melted butter
should look creamy , rather than melted and oily . Keep
stirring and blending until almost all of the butter is
incorporated, then remove the pan from the heat as you
work in the last bit.
Add the coriander , ginger , 1/4 tsp salt, a few grinds of
pepper , and the lemon juice, then gently stir in the chopped
