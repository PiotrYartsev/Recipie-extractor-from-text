You need the same equipment for making a sabayon that
you need for making its savory sister , hollandaise. That
includes a double-boiler setup of a wide, medium
stainlesssteel bowl and a medium saucepan, a good whisk
and a strong arm or a handheld electric mixer , and a heat-
resistant rubber spatula for scraping the sides of the bowl
as you whisk and to fold in any whipped cream.
STORAGE
Warm sabayon wonâ€™t hold for more than about 30 minutes
in the double boiler over very low heat, so it is best made
just before serving. A chilled sabayon lightened with
whipped cream can be refrigerated in an airtight container
for up to 24 hours.
