HOLLANDAISE SAUCES
IF THE ONL Y HOLLANDAISE SAUCE YOU’VE EVER
TASTED IS THA T SORR Y YELLOW P ASTE FROM A
PACKET , YOU WON’T YET UNDERST AND MY JOY A T
MAKING HOMEMADE HOLLANDAISE.  But once you’ve
tried it yourself , you will. It isn’t diﬀicult, but it does
require proper technique and a little attention. And the
resulting sauce is a true French treasure: light and billowy ,
lemony , and rich with butter and egg, tasting of neither but
rather of something all its own.
Hollandaise is traditionally used to sauce that Sunday-
brunch staple, eggs Benedict, a slightly odd dish because
you are putting an egg sauce on top of eggs. I adore it
anyway , and I have updated it in this chapter for a delicious
change of pace. But I think hollandaise comes into its glory
when paired with green vegetables, because its richness is
countered by fresh wholesomeness. Steamed asparagus,
broccoli, or even slightly bitter broccoli rabe are fantastic
with a lemony hollandaise, and dipping artichoke leaves
into the Saﬀron–Red P epper Hollandaise on page 152
would be a lovely way to spend a summer evening.
WHAT’S GOING ON IN THIS SAUCE?
Making hollandaise sauce really feels like you’re
participating in French cuisine. First, you whisk egg yolks
and a small amount of a ﬂavoring liquid over low heat. This
gently cooks the yolks, thickening them and allowing them
to capture the air bubbles that are introduced as you whisk.
