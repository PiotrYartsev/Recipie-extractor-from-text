RUM-SOAKED PRUNE and FRANGIPANE
TART with MAPLE-RUM SABAYON
MAKES ONE 9-IN/23-CM T ART; SERVES 6 TO 8
Prunes are underappreciated in the United States, and I
have no idea why . Meaty , sweet, and complex, they’re even
more delicious when plumped up with some dark spirits
such as rum, Cognac, or bourbon. I love those warm ﬂavors
paired with almonds, so I ﬁll this tart shell with an almond
frangipane and nestle the prunes inside. The touch of
maple and the boozy bite in the sabayon marry perfectly
with the other ﬂavors.
