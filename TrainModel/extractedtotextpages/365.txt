of the pan, until it is a deep amber , smells like caramel, and
you can see just the tiniest wisps of smoke, 9 to 12 minutes.
The caramel will be very hot at this point. Remove the
saucepan from the heat and carefully add a little bit of the
coconut cream; the caramel will bubble up furiously .
Return the pan to low heat and whisk in the remaining
coconut cream a little at a time (to avoid bubbling over),
then whisk in the butter , rum, and salt. Continue to whisk
until the sauce is very smooth and slightly thickened, about
2 minutes more. Remove the pan from the heat and let the
sauce cool in the pan; it will thicken as it cools. Serve warm
or at room temperature.

QUICK CHANGE  Fold 1/2 cup/110 g crushed canned or
