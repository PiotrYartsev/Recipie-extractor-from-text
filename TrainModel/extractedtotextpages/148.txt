 
BEURRE FONDU (MELTED BUTTER)
MAKES ABOUT 1/2 CUP/120 ML
This sauce, which is sometimes called drawn butter , is
simply melted butter and lemon juice. But leave it to the
French to reﬁne a simple thing into a creamy sauce that
beautifully cloaks food, distributing the butter and lemon
ﬂavors evenly . Use this as a dip for Dungeness crab or
lobster or as a sauce for tender spring vegetables,
especially asparagus, fava beans, or baby carrots.
1/4 cup/60 ml water
1/2 cup/115 g very cold unsalted butter in one piece
1 tsp fr esh lemon juice, plus mor e if needed
Kosher salt
In a small saucepan, bring the water to a boil over medium-
high heat. Add the butter and start stirring it around in
circles with a whisk, a fork, a wooden spoon, or anything
that lets you “stab” the hunk of butter so that you can move
it around easily . The butter will start to melt and the
mixture will bubble and boil around the edges. The melted
butter should look creamy , rather than melted and oily .
Keep stirring and blending until almost all of the butter is
incorporated, then remove the pan from the heat as you
work in the last bit. Add the lemon juice and 1/4 tsp salt.
