SOUPS, SIDE SNACKS, 
AND DIPPING SAUCES
Dumplings are infinitely better when paired with a flavorful dipping 
sauce. You can make a meal from a variety of dumplings by adding a 
soup, side dish, or plate of noodles. This chapter features an assort-
ment of soups to which you can add any number of dumplings for 
a comforting bowl of dumpling soup. Youâ€™ll also find classic condi-
ments such as Chili Crisp Sauce (page 99) and its savory cousin, XO 
Sauce (page 100).
