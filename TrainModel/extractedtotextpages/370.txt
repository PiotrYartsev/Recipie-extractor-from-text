 
MARY JANE’S MOLASSES SAUCE
MAKES 1 3/4 CUPS/420 ML
Molasses isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but for those of us
who love it, there’s nothing better than a chewy molasses–
peanut butter Mary Jane candy . That was my inspiration for
this sauce, which is wonderful with apple cake or
gingerbread, or over a big scoop of vanilla or coﬀee ice
cream.
1 cup/200 g lightly pack ed light or dark br own sugar
3/4 cup/180 ml heavy cr eam
1/4 cup/60 ml unsulfur ed light or dark molasses, plus mor e if
needed
1/4 cup/70 g cr eamy peanut butter, plus mor e if needed
Kosher salt
1 tbsp honey, plus mor e if needed
In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar , cream,
molasses, peanut butter , and a pinch of salt and bring to a
boil (you need a lot of extra volume in the pan because the
mixture will foam up during cooking) over medium-high
heat, stirring until blended. Once the mixture is at a boil,
reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook, stirring
occasionally , until slightly reduced and very syrupy , 4 to 6
minutes.
