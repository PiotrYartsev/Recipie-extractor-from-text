Cognac, port and other wines, and certain other spirits can
add a nice dimension to gravy , but only in moderation, as
they can overwhelm any gravy easily . Anything with alcohol
needs to simmer long enough to cook oﬀ most of the
alcohol. W ines need to be reduced by at least three-fourths
for them not to taste thin and sour in a sauce, so I prefer to
use wine in a jus, where the reduction doesn’t interfere
with the thickening. Apple cider can be lovely in a turkey or
pork gravy , and a touch of cream to ﬁnish can be nice.
THE F AT Most of the fat comes from the drippings of the
roast, but if you like, you can incorporate other fats, such
as butter , bacon fat, or duck fat, for ﬂavor or to make up
volume. Y ou will have the most control over the amount of
fat if you ﬁrst pour it all oﬀ and then measure back the
amount you need. Save any extra fat to use for cooking
other dishes later .
THE P AN JUICES  These are the drippings that are still
liquid. Y ou don’t always get a lot of them, though one
Thanksgiving in London I roasted a 14-pound/6.5-kilogram
turkey that produced about 1 quart/1 liter of delectable pan
juices—amazing.
THE BROWN BITS  These are the drippings that have
cooked onto the bottom of the pan, where they become
concentrated and caramelized. They are the ﬂavor power-
plants of your gravy and must be protected from burning
and from the cook wanting to snack on them.
THE THICKENER  I always use all-purpose ﬂour because
it’s handy , but some cooks swear by W ondra ﬂour , a brand
of so-called instant ﬂour engineered not to form lumps, and
other cooks use cornstarch. I don’t like the way cornstarch
sets—slightly gel-like—so, again, all-purpose ﬂour works
best for me.
