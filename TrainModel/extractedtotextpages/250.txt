1/8 tsp hot-pepper sauce such as Sriracha
In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
Don’t stir as it melts. Y ou want the milky solids to fall to the
bottom and the butterfat to ﬂoat to the top. K eep warm.
In a food processor , combine the red peppers and olive oil
and process until a smooth purée forms. Y ou want to
emulsify the oil with the peppers; the mixture should look
creamy and combined.
Pour water to a depth of 1 to 2 in/2.5 to 5 cm into a medium
saucepan and place over medium heat. Rest a medium
stainless-steel bowl in the pan over (not touching) the
water . Put the orange juice, water , 1/4 tsp salt, and saﬀron
into the bowl and let sit over the heat for a few minutes so
the saﬀron infuses the liquid. When you can smell the
saﬀron, add the egg yolks and start whisking. As the bowl
heats up, the yolks will begin to thicken. Whisk vigorously ,
scraping around the bowl with a heat-resistant rubber
spatula from time to time so that bits of yolk don’t get stuck
and overcook. Beat until thick and frothy but not quite
ﬂuﬀy , 3 to 4 minutes. The whisk will start leaving a clear
space on the bottom of the bowl. Remove the bowl from the
heat and whisk for another 30 seconds or so to stabilize the
sauce and let the bowl cool down.
Continue whisking as you slowly drizzle in the warm melted
butter , taking care not to add too much of the milky-watery
layer from the bottom of the pan. As you pour and whisk,
make sure the yolks are accepting the butter and the yolks
and butter are emulsifying. If the sauce looks at all broken
or “curdly ,” stop adding butter and just whisk for a few
seconds. Only resume adding butter once you’ve whisked
the sauce into creaminess again.
