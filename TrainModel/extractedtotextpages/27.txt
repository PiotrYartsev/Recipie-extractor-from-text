A Step-by-Step Guide to Doughs and Folds 2929
STEP 4 STEP 5
5. Pull the opposite two corners toward each other and crisscross them together. 
Pinch and seal where they meet as though you are making an X with the two 
ends. Use a dab of slurry to help keep them together, if needed.
6. Place the sealed dumpling on a plate and cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with 
the remaining wonton wrappers and filling.
Fold #4: The Parcel Fold
This is a more difficult fold but has a nice contemporary look when it’s cooked. 
Y ou see this shape more commonly with deep-fried dumplings such as Crab Ran-
goons (page 78).
1. If using store-bought wrappers, in a small bowl, stir together 1 teaspoon (3 g) 
cornstarch and 1 tablespoon (15 g) warm water to create a cornstarch slurry. 
Skip the slurry if using homemade wrappers. The slurry helps store-bought 
wrappers stick together to seal (they have a drier consistency than 
homemade ones).
2. Lay 1 square or round wrapper on a cutting board and place 1 tablespoon 
(weight varies) of filling in the center. Use the back of the spoon to flatten the 
filling slightly.
3. If using store-bought wrappers, dip the tip of your index finger into the slurry 
and moisten the edge of the wrapper around all four sides.
