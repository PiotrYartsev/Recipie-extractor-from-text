anodized aluminum or cast iron). A plain stainless-steel
saucepan is best. And never use a pan with a nonstick
surface. Caramel temperatures are too hot for it, plus it is
too dark to gauge color . To judge the color accurately ,
scoop out a tiny bit with a metal spoon and drip it onto a
heatproof white plate.
Many cookbooks warn against the problem of
crystallization when making caramel. They suggest that if
you incorrectly handle the sugar as it heats, it will
crystallize and become lumpy and blocky rather than melt
into a smooth syrup. This comes about when stray
undissolved sugar crystals “infect” your syrup and cause
the whole batch to crystallize. The various methods to
avoid this include brushing down the inside of the saucepan
with cold water as you heat the sugar , putting a lid on the
saucepan as the caramel cooks so the trapped
condensation wets the sides of the pan, and never stirring
the sugar as it melts.
I’m sure that it is technically possible for unwanted
crystallization to occur , but in all my years of making
caramel, it has never happened to me. I even tried to
provoke it into occurring once at a former job in a test
kitchen and I failed. So, here I will be a contrarian and say
that I don’t think it’s a risk that is worth putting eﬀort into
avoiding. If your sugar crystallizes, just keep cooking and
stirring it until it melts into submission. Or dump it out and
start again.
HOW MUCH SAUCE PER SERVING?
This depends on how you are serving the sauce, of course,
but you probably don’t need much more than 2 tablespoons
