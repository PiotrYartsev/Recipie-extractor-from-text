23 A Step-by-Step Guide to Doughs and Folds HOST A DUMPLING PARTY!
Many hands make light work, as the saying goes. Just as it’s more fun to enjoy dump-
lings with friends and family, it’s even more fun to get them in on the action by hosting 
a dumpling party! Best of all, having friends and family help assemble the dumplings 
means you can enjoy them that much faster.
TIPS FOR HOSTING A SUCCESSFUL DUMPLING PARTY
/uni25B8Prepare all the fillings and wrappers ahead of time. Guests can help with rolling, 
filling, and pleating. It will go faster if you have everything prepared and ready to go 
for assembly. Har gow, steamed baos, and shu mai are always party favorites.
/uni25B8The same goes for any dipping sauces, teas, and snacks. Have these prepared and 
ready to go.
/uni25B8Keep the folding simple. Decide on two or three easy folds you can show others 
how to make, like the half-moon and parcel folds. Don’t get too focused on how the 
dumplings turn out. As long as the dumpling is filled and wrapped and somewhat 
pleated, it will taste delicious!
/uni25B8Set out multiple piles of wrappers, small bowls of filling, and several sets of tools 
and slurry so people aren’t reaching over each other.
/uni25B8Get creative! Set up a mixing station of proteins and filling ingredients and invite 
guests to create their own fillings.
/uni25B8Avoid anything that requires deep-frying, as it can be unsafe if people aren’t paying 
attention. Instead, make pan-fried dumplings, such as potstickers or shengjian bao.
