allow the mixture to boil, which will give the cream a
“cooked” taste.
Put the chocolate in a stainless-steel or other heatproof
medium bowl, and pour the cream mixture over the
chocolate. Leave undisturbed for about 1 minute to melt
the chocolate, then start whisking in small circles in the
center of the bowl, widening your whisking toward the
outer edges of the bowl as the sauce becomes glossy and
smooth. Whisk in the butter and then stir in the cherry-port
mixture, almond extract, and salt. Serve warm or slightly
cooled.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1
month or fr eeze for up to 3 months. If making the sauce
ahead, very gently r eheat it in a saucepan to loosen it up,
adding 2 to 3 tsp very hot water if needed to thin it out.
QUICK CHANGE  Add 1 tbsp kirsch (cher ry liqueur) instead
of the almond e xtract.
