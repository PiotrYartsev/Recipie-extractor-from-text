The Really UsefUl InfoRmaTIon 557Tips for sT ir-frying:
* Never overload the wok with food. You’ll lose the intense heat and ultimately ending up 
with a ‘stir-braise’. A wok is designed for small amounts of food at a time, especially on 
domestic hotplates which don’t usually produce enough heat for ideal stir-frying.
* A good peanut oil is recommended for stir-frying. 
* Wok implements are vital tools for wok cooking. I prefer the ‘hok’: the ladle-shaped, 
long-handled implement, so I can scoop and turn the food. It is also very handy when it comes to serving, whether soup, noodles or vegetables. The flat, shovel-like lifter is good for moving the food around the wok, ensuring it is cooked quickly.
* Always heat the wok to very hot before adding the oil, then quickly add the remaining 
ingredients. If you heat the oil as the wok heats, you’ll burn the oil.
* Some books tell you to heat the wok until it is ‘smoking’, then add the oil—right they 
are.
* If you have a traditional thin metal Chinese wok, do the following every now and again 
to help keep the wok sealed and prevent food from sticking. Heat the wok until it’s almost white-hot (watch as the bottom of the wok begins to turn white), remove from the heat, cool slightly and carefully wipe with a cloth, then return the wok to the heat and again ensure an intense heat is produced before adding oil and the ingredients.
* If you have an electric wok, a nonstick wok or you’re using a pan or skillet, the smoking 
point is irrelevant. Instead add a few droplets of water and watch as they form small, tight balls that roll around. This is when it is hot enough. Just remember to remove or evaporate the water before adding the oil.
Sweating means cooking vegetables in a little oil or butter over a medium heat, in a covered 
pot or pan, to release moisture and intensify the flavour. Sweating is also a method of cooking chefs, usually in the middle of summer, and usually in a small kitchen with no air flow. For best results, wrap them in long-sleeved jackets, long pants, thick socks and steel-capped boots, and reduce valuable heat loss by covering their heads with a silly looking hat. Pressure cook for 12–14 hours until sweating profusely. Best served with a beer! 
White braising is a method seldom used today because of the time it takes. It is 
designed for meat, such as veal, lamb, kid and other young animals. The meat is cooked on the stovetop in a brown stock which is reduced to a glaze and topped up 3 times. It is then packed snugly into a baking tray and more brown stock is added (to cover about half the meat). The tray is covered and the meat cooked in the oven until tender.
