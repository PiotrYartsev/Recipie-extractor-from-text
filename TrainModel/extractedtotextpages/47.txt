51 Steamed Dumplings6. Cook and serve: In a 10-inch-wide stockpot or wok, 
bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Stack the steamer baskets 
over the pot and reduce the heat to medium to keep a 
low simmer.
7. Steam for 7 to 9 minutes, or until the dumpling skins look 
translucent and slightly wrinkly around the filling. When 
the dumplings are fully cooked, the internal tempera-
ture of the filling should read 165Â°F on an instant-read 
thermometer. Check and add more water to the pot, 
if necessary.
8. Remove the baskets from the wok and place on platters. 
Serve the dumplings directly from the baskets.
