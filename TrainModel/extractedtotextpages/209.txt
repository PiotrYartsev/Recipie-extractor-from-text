3/4 cup/180 ml Light, L emony Cream Sauce , heated
1 cup/115 g grated P armigiano -Reggiano cheese, plus mor e
for serving (optional)
1 tbsp chopped fr esh mild-ﬂavor ed herb such as parsley,
dill, mint, tar ragon, or basil
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat and add
2 tbsp salt. Have ready a sieve or a large slotted spoon.
Add the carrots, fennel, and asparagus to the boiling water
and boil for 1 minute. Add the peas and boil for 1 minute
longer . Scoop out all of the vegetables with the sieve or
spoon, shake oﬀ the water , and put them in a bowl. Set
aside and keep warm.
Let the water come back to a boil, add the pasta, and cook
until al dente, according to the package instructions. Just
before the pasta is ready , scoop out about 1 cup/240 ml of
the cooking water and set aside. Drain the pasta well and
return it to the pot.
Pour in the sauce, add the vegetables and the cheese, and
toss well, coating the pasta evenly and melting the cheese.
Let the pasta sit for a minute, so it can absorb the liquid. It
should be fairly liquidy at ﬁrst, but as it sits, it will ﬁrm up,
so check the consistency again just before serving and add
a few spoonfuls of the reserved cooking water to get the
consistency correct. Finally , toss in the herb and season
with salt and pepper . Serve right away and pass more
cheese at the table, if you like.
