Transfer the batter to a large glass measuring cup with a
spout (or to a bowl into which you can easily dip a 1/4 -
cup/60-ml ladle or measuring cup). Let the batter rest for
at least 30 minutes at room temperature or refrigerate for
up to 24 hours. When you are ready to make the crepes,
test the consistency of the batter . It should be as thick as
heavy cream, but not as thick as pancake batter . If it is too
thick, whisk in more milk.
Heat a crepe pan with an 8-in/20-cm base, nonstick frying
pan, or well-seasoned frying pan over medium-high heat
until a drop of water ﬂicked onto the surface sizzles on
contact. Using a folded paper towel, spread about 1/2 tsp
butter around the interior of the pan. The butter should
sizzle on contact, but you don’t want the pan so hot that the
butter burns.
Pour about 1/4 cup/60 ml of the batter into the center of the
pan. As you pour , lift the pan from the heat and tilt and turn
it in all directions so the batter spreads evenly across the
bottom of the pan in a thin circle. If the crepe has any holes
in it, quickly add a few drops of batter to ﬁll them in. Or , if
you have too much batter and the crepe looks too thick,
immediately pour the excess back into the measuring cup
or bowl. Y ou can always trim oﬀ the “tail” that’s left behind.
Cook the crepe until the edges begin to dry and lift from
the edge of the pan and the bottom is nicely browned,
about 1 minute. T o check for color , use a table knife, thin
oﬀset spatula, or your ﬁngers to lift up an edge of the crepe
and look underneath. When the ﬁrst side is ready , use the
knife, spatula, or your ﬁngers to lift the crepe and quickly
ﬂip it over . Smooth out any folded edges or pleats, and then
cook until the center is ﬁrm and the second side is
browned, too, about 20 seconds more.
