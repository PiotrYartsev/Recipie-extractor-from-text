Thai sweet chili sauce is available in most Asian markets, but it’s easy to make at home, 
which allows you to control the amount of sweetness and heat. The finished sauce should 
have a perfect balance of sweet, hot, and savory. Serve with Crab Rangoons (page 78) or 
Turkey and Napa Cabbage Potstickers (page 82).
