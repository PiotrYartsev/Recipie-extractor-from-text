The Basics: a really useful cookB ook 536TomaToes
Tomatoes arrive in all their glorious shapes, sizes and colours. And like most fruit and 
vegetables, the tomato can indeed be a wondrous fruit when home grown—tasting sweet and delicious—or it can be a sad, pale, tasteless ball of water that has been mass-produced. By supporting farmers’ markets you will be joining the chorus; This is how tomatoes used to taste.
Tips:
* Fragrance is a better indicator of a good tomato than colour; use your nose to smell the 
stem end. The stem should retain the garden aroma of the plant itself. If it doesn’t, your 
tomato will lack flavour.
* Keep tomatoes on the windowsill to ripen, then store at room temperature. If tomatoes are 
fully ripe or starting to soften, use them immediately or move them to the fridge.
* The best knife for cutting tomatoes has a serrated edge, is about 15 cm long, and has 
finer teeth than a bread knife.
* Add to a leafy salad at the last minute to prevent the acid and weight of the tomatoes 
from breaking down the lettuce.
* To avoid soggy sandwiches, place each slice of tomato on a piece of paper towel to absorb 
excess water before it goes on the bread.
* The acid in fresh or canned tomatoes will strip an iron pan of its natural nonstick 
coating leaving it susceptible to rusting—choose something like stainless steel for cooking.
* Tomato ‘water’, the clearish liquid that escapes from a sliced tomato, can be used as a 
low-acidity stand-in for lemon juice. Try it for marinating raw fish.
* To peel a tomato, score the skin very lightly with the point of a sharp knife. Then 
blanch for 10–15 seconds, no more—the longer the tomato cooks, the more flesh will be ripped off when you peel the tomato. Don’t drop the tomatoes in iced water after blanching, as this will dilute the flavour.
* Unripe, green tomatoes can be sliced, dipped in polenta and fried.
* Rehydrate dried tomatoes (those not sold in oil) in hot water for 15 minutes. Drain 
and then marinate in olive oil, chopped herbs, and balsamic or white wine vinegar (1 part vinegar to 5 parts oil). Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
