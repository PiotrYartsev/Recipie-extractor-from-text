CHOCOLATE SAUCES
PUT THE WORDS CHOCOLA TE AND SAUCE TOGETHER
AND YOU INST ANTL Y HA VE A P ARTY. There’s something
innately festive about liquid chocolate. Even better , making
homemade chocolate sauce oﬀers huge rewards for very
little eﬀort. Indeed, once you see how easy it is, you won’t
ever buy the low-quality mass-produced stuﬀ or the high-
priced artisanal products again. Y ou are the artisan now .
And whatever your chocolate mood, you can make a
multidimensional sauce to suit it. As you vary the type of
chocolate you use and the other ingredients you add, you
can create sauces that range from a lush and creamy
ganache to a deep, dark cocoa sauce to an almost-chewy
hot fudge sauce.
For many people, the best way to serve chocolate sauce is
on a spoon, delivered directly from bowl to mouth. I do like
to sneak a spoonful now and then, but I think chocolate
sauce is in its full glory when it’s involved with other
dessert components. The most obvious is ice cream: a few
chopped nuts and a dollop of whipped cream turn chocolate
sauce and ice cream into a full-ﬂedged sundae. Drizzle
chocolate sauce over fat, ripe strawberries, or use it as
fondue for dipping banana chunks, shortbread cookies,
macadamia nuts, cubes of pound cake, or anything else
that can be dipped. Simple cakes are prime candidates for
chocolate sauces because their thirsty crumb soaks up the
deliciousness. Or , drizzle dark, slightly bitter chocolate
sauce over lightly grilled bread that has been brushed with
extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkled with coarse salt, a riﬀ on
a Spanish snack.
