Pour water to a depth of 1 to 2 in/2.5 to 5 cm into a medium
saucepan and place over medium heat. Rest a medium
stainless-steel bowl in the pan over (not touching) the
water . Put the egg yolks, lime juice, and 1/4 tsp salt in the
bowl and start whisking. As the bowl heats up, the yolks
will begin to thicken. Whisk vigorously , scraping around the
bowl with a heat-resistant rubber spatula from time to time
so that bits of yolk don’t get stuck and overcook. Beat until
thick and frothy but not quite ﬂuﬀy , 3 to 4 minutes. The
whisk will start leaving a clear space on the bottom of the
bowl. Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk for another
30 seconds or so to stabilize the sauce and let the bowl cool
down.
Continue whisking as you slowly drizzle in the browned
butter . Unlike with classic hollandaise, go ahead and add
all of the milk solids at the bottom of the pan. They carry
most of the “browned” ﬂavor . As you pour and whisk, make
sure the yolks are accepting the butter and the yolks and
butter are emulsifying. If the sauce looks at all broken or
“curdly ,” stop adding butter and just whisk for a few
seconds. Only resume adding butter once you’ve whisked
the sauce into creaminess again.
Once all of the butter has been added, whisk in the lime
zest and hot-pepper sauce. T aste and adjust the seasoning
with salt, lime juice, and hot-pepper sauce if needed. If
possible, serve right away .

airtight container for up to 3 days.
