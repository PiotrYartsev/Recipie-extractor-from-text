The Really UsefUl InfoRmaTIon 481liquor or chocolate liquor. Chocolate liquor is bitter and can be put aside to set to be 
sold as bitter chocolate. It is about 50/50 cocoa solids and cocoa butter; the solids provide the chocolatey taste in the final product and the butter provides smoothness and ‘mouth feel’. Next, the chocolate liquor goes through a hydraulic press that separates the cocoa butter and solids, and this is the stage when the chocolate maker applies recipes and techniques that ultimately define their brand. Commonly added are sugar, milk solids and flavours such as vanilla. The next step in the process is conching, when the chocolate liquid mass is stirred and mixed at 55
–75°C to give it a smooth texture. This process causes 
friction between the added sugars and the cocoa, leaving a polished cocoa particle. Invented by chocolate manufacturer Rudolf Lindt, conching gets its name from the shell-like shape of the machine’s rollers. Lower-quality chocolates may not have been through this conching stage, resulting in a grainy, average-tasting chocolate. Others are conched for hours, even days, for a more luxurious texture. Valrhona, one of the best chocolate makers in the world, conches its chocolate for 5 days. The final stage in making chocolate is tempering: the chocolate is slowly heated then slowly cooled. Tempering allows the chocolate to harden properly and prevents the cocoa butter from separating. Adding flavours, conching and tempering are fine arts with idiosyncratic results. The two things to look for when you’re choosing chocolate are the percentage of cocoa liquor compared to other additives, and the percentage of cocoa butter to cocoa solids (the latter is often hard to determine from the label).
Tips for melT ing chocolaTe 
Put the uninitiated cook around chocolate and they quickly become the painter’s apprentice, 
slopping it around and coating everything, including the inside of the cutlery drawer. There are two methods for melting chocolate effectively: 
* In the microwave: melt at 50 per cent power for 20 –30 second intervals, stirring each 
time. Don’t omit the step of stirring, as warmed chocolate keeps its shape, and may look like it needs more time when in fact it has begun to melt. 
* In the double boiler: bring the water to the boil in the lower saucepan, then turn off 
the heat. Place the chocolate in the upper saucepan or in a heatproof bowl over the boiled water and let the residual heat from the water slowly melt the chocolate. Rush this process and you run the risk of scorching the chocolate, making it stiff, lumpy and grainy. 
* To add liquid to melted chocolate: heat the liquid first. If you add cold liquid, the 
chocolate will solidify or seize. Even the moisture from a wet spoon is enough to tamper with melting chocolate. Alternatively, you can add liquid before you start melting the chocolate and heat them both together.

* Seized? Once chocolate has seized, it is unlikely to remelt (although you can try adding 
a spoonful of vegetable oil which can soften the chocolate enough to continue). The best use 
for it then is to make chocolate sauce or ganache. 
* Bloomed? Blooming often occurs when chocolate is chilled and then returned to room 
temperature. Chocolate that blooms is still edible with only the slightest difference in flavour and texture. You can melt it to regain its original texture.
