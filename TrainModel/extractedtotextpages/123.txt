 
GARLICKY POTATO SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 1 1/2 CUPS/360 ML
Potato may seem an unlikely main ingredient for a sauce,
but when puréed and emulsiﬁed with olive oil, lemon juice,
and a bit of water , this Greek -inspired sauce is luscious and
a great dip for vegetables. Use a good-quality olive oil,
something fruity and fragrant but not biting, and add the
garlic cloves to your taste.
8 oz/225 g star chy potatoes such as russets, peeled and cut
into chunks
Kosher salt and fr eshly gr ound black pepper
