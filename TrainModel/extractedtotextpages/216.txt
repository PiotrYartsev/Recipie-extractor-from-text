Portion size for mayonnaise depends on where the sauce is
being used. F or most uses, such as a dip or on a sandwich,
a couple of tablespoons are plenty .
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT
A large bowl and a whisk are all you need, but a food
processor makes the job easy , and a rubber spatula helps
corral all of the ingredients.
STORAGE
Even though the French chefs at my cooking school would
leave a bowl of mayonnaise on the counter for days, it’s
important to refrigerate mayonnaise because it’s made with
raw egg yolks. And if you have any concerns about eating
or serving raw yolks (folks who are pregnant, elderly , very
young, or have a compromised immune system should
avoid them), use pasteurized eggs. Or , just use commercial
mayonnaise and add the ﬂavoring elements in the recipes.
It’s okay to cheat sometimes! Most mayonnaises will keep
in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
