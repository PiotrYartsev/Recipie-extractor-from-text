THE METHOD
1. Sauté your ingredient. P erfect candidates for this type of
cooking include boneless, skinless chicken breasts,
duck breasts, pork chops, pork tenderloin medallions,
small steaks, hamburgers, lamb chops, scallops, and
shrimp. I like to dust the ingredient with seasoned
ﬂour, which helps create a nice browning on the food
and the small amount of ﬂour left in the pan has a
subtle thickening action on the sauce. But a pan sauce
can be made without using ﬂour .
For the fat, I use half butter and half oil. Butter
encourages browning and imparts ﬂavor , and oil
keeps the butter from burning.
2. Set your cooked meat (let’s just call it that for
simplicity’s sake) on a plate or other dish that will
catch any juices that run and tent with aluminum foil to
keep warm. As you do this, don’t leave the pan on the
burner because you might burn the juices.
3. Pour oﬀ any loose fat, but take care not to pour oﬀ any
ﬂoating brown bits. Those are the tasty parts that are
the keys to ﬂavor in the sauce.
4. Return the pan to medium-high heat.
5. Add your aromatic ingredient, if using one, and sauté
brieﬂy so it softens but doesn’t brown, 30 seconds to 1
minute. Then, add your ﬁrst liquid, which will probably
be something with a strong ﬂavor—brandy , wine, port,
or vinegar—an ingredient that needs to be tamed by
reduction but will also provide a backbone of intense
ﬂavor to the sauce. Cook the liquid until it has
evaporated—reduced—to just a spoonful or so . You
want a ﬂavorful essence without the harsh qualities of
the original liquid.
