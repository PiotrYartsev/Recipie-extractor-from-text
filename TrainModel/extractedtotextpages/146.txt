burn, however , you should start over because the ﬂavor of
the sauce will be compromised.
Second, once you add the butter , the emulsion breaks and
your sauce separates. This happens for two reasons: you’re
trying to whisk in too much butter and the emulsiﬁcation
can’t hold it all, or you let the sauce get too hot and the
butter melts incorrectly . The remedy is the same: if your
sauce looks ﬁne right up until the end and then you
suddenly see droplets of butterfat forming, pull it oﬀ the
heat and whisk in a teaspoon or two of cold water or heavy
cream.
You can preemptively avoid a broken sauce by adding some
cream to the reduction before you add the butter . Many
chefs do this as a matter of course, especially if they’re
making the sauce for a restaurant, where it needs to sit,
well behaved, throughout the dinner service. I prefer to use
cream only when I want a truly creamy dimension to the
sauce; I don’t use it to prevent breakage. Even a little bit of
extra cream can mute the subtle dynamic between the acid
and butter , which I like, but it’s a perfectly good trick to
use if you’re feeling less than conﬁdent.
HOW MUCH SAUCE PER SERVING?
Usually 2 tablespoons per person is the average serving,
though it will depend on what the sauce accompanies.
