Tips for buying and sT oring cheese:
* Don’t be afraid to ask for a sample of cheese before buying (although a supermarket is 
the last place this service would be offered). If you are unable to sample the cheese, look 
carefully before buying: avoid any wrapped cheeses that show weeping or shrinkage and any unwrapped cheeses that show signs of drying around the edges or cracking in harder cheese. 
* Stored in its original wrapper, unopened, in the coldest part of the refrigerator, cheese 
(especially hard cheese) can live a grand life, often beyond its ‘use by’ date. However, cheese is a living food and needs to breathe to develop. The best way to store it is wrapped in a calico cloth or waxed paper. (Don’t use plastic wrap or foil.) Ideally, keep cheese in a cool, moist cave, with good ventilation and a stable air temperature from 8
–12°C. As most 
houses lack a good cave, the refrigerator will have to suffice.
* Mould spores from blue cheese can spread to other cheese and food in the same storage 
area, so make sure blue cheese in particular is thoroughly wrapped. 
* Freezing cheese is not recommended, although leftover grated cheese and some semi-hard 
cheeses keep well in the freezer. Soft cheeses like brie and camembert do not appreciate this treatment. 
* Remove cheese from the fridge and stand at room temperature for 1 –2 hours before serving. 
This allows the flavour and aroma to develop.
Tips for a cheese board:
* Don’t feel the need to always serve a vast array of different cheeses at a dinner party. 
Choose 2 or 3, ranging in texture from hard to semi-hard to semi-soft, allowing 80 –100 g of 
cheese per person, less if cheese is to be served before or after a dessert.
* Make sure your guests enjoy a particular cheese before spending your money —blue cheese 
is not for everyone.
* Serving cut fruit on the same plate as the cheese is an insult; cheese should be served 
simply on its own. Any fruit to be enjoyed with the cheese, whether fresh, dried or as a 
paste, can be served on a separate plate. Offer bread as well as biscuits with cheese; fruit breads, nut breads and wine breads are all suitable.
