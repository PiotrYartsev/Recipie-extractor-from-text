Gently reheat the vanilla-infused milk over medium-low
heat until just beginning to simmer .
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the egg
yolks, sugar , and salt until well blended. Do not whisk so
much that the mixture gets foamy , however .
When the vanilla-infused milk is hot, slowly pour about half
of it into yolk -sugar mixture, whisking constantly until
combined. Return the pan to medium-low heat, then whisk
in the yolk mixture. Gently cook the sauce, frequently
scraping the bottom and sides of the pan with a heat-
resistant rubber spatula or a wooden spoon, until it

an instant-read thermometer .
Remove from the heat and remove and discard the vanilla
pod. F or a very smooth texture (or if you’re worried that
you’ve gotten some bits of overcooked egg in the sauce),
strain the sauce through a ﬁne-mesh sieve. Let cool, cover ,
and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour .
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5
days. The sauce does not fr eeze well.
