To strain, I use a ﬁne-mesh sieve that is 7 inches/17
centimeters in diameter and has a long handle on one side
and a small loop on the other , which allows me to secure
the sieve over a bowl or saucepan as I work the contents
through the mesh. The best way to do that is with a rubber
spatula, though a wide wooden spoon is good, too . One of
my prize kitchen tools is an unassuming white plastic card
that I bought in P aris, curved on one side and straight on
the opposite side. It’s called a racle-tout, or “scrape-all,”
and it’s excellent for scraping out the last bit of batter from
a bowl and for forcing a mixture through a sieve and
scraping oﬀ the purée that clings to the underside. Y ou’ll
ﬁnd a few diﬀerent versions of this handy tool at cookware
stores. The one I like is made by Matfer .
HOW MUCH SAUCE PER SERVING?
The sauces are so diverse in this chapter that the serving
sizes vary from a couple of tablespoons for something like
the Butternut Squash and Apple Cider Sauce to 1/2 cup/120
milliliters for the red chiles sauce when used in the Simple
and Delicious Enchiladas.
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT
Almost all of these sauces are pureed, which is best
accomplished by using a food processor or blender . I prefer
the processor unless the sauce is very liquidy , in which case
the blender is best. A ﬁne-mesh sieve lets you give your
sauces a satiny texture.
