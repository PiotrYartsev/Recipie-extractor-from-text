The Really UsefUl InfoRmaTIon 503make a small incision in one side of the steak and look to see how done it is. (Remember to 
serve with the cut side down.) Of course, the sealed surface area has now been cut, allowing valuable juices to escape. So once the incision has been made, also press the meat with a finger and remember what that pressure feels like. Soon you will be able to tell what a rare steak feels like without having to cut into it.
* Undercooked one person’s steak? Slice it in two (lengthways) and place back in the pan 
for another minute or so; now you have two steaks.
* Undercooked roast? As you usually don’t discover it’s undercooked until you’ve started 
carving, placing it back in the oven is not an option. The best thing to do is slice the meat a bit thicker and finish cooking each piece as a steak. 
* Burnt a casserole, stew or soup? Don’t stir it! Plonk the pot immediately into a sink of 
cold water to stop the cooking. This is an important step. Then lift out the ingredients without disturbing the bottom of the pot, and place in a fresh pot or dish. Taste the food to assess whether the burnt flavour has permeated the liquid and if so, by how much. If it’s really bad, the bin is the only option. If it tastes only slightly burnt, try masking the flavour with a sauce such as Worcestershire sauce, barbecue sauce or tomato paste, or with other strong flavours such as garlic, chilli or onion (sautéed first in a separate pan) or spices (dry-roasted first). 
Beef
Aged beef is beef that is hung in the butcher’s cool room for as little as 5 days or as long 
as 21 days (any longer and the meat is thought to deteriorate). Hanging the beef (which can be done by several methods) allows enzymes within the meat to start breaking down muscle fibres, rendering it tender and tasty. Some muscle groups age at different rates, depending on the hanging method, and generally only the best cuts are reserved for hanging. There is little advantage in hanging stewing beef or beef ready for mincing.
Tips:
* I recommend the personal experience of buying beef from a butcher, who, if you’re loyal, 
will source, cut, hang (age) or put aside meat just for you. It beats peering for colour and 
marbling through the plastic wrap in the supermarket, and has the advantage that they can help choose the best cut for the dish you are planning.
* Remove any ‘silver skin’ from beef (and other meats) with a sharp knife to prevent the 
meat from contorting when cooked. Better still, ask your butcher to remove it for you to save time and wastage of precious meat.
* Grass-fed versus grain-fed—the majority of the world’s population wouldn’t know the 
difference, nor would the majority of the world’s professional cooks. Keep in mind that many things determine the outcome of the final product, from stress and drought experienced by the animal while still alive, through to ageing and cooking technique. Most of the beef in Australia is grass-fed, and is generally favoured for its flavour.
* Bone-in versus bone-out—cooking meat on the bone does contribute to flavour, and the bone 
can also act as a mild heat conductor to help in the cooking process. However, if you are in a hurry and lack carving skills, buy your meat boned and rolled; the loss in flavour is not significant.
