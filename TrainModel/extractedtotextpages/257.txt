until tender and lightly browned, 6 to 9 minutes. Add the
garlic and Espelette pepper and cook, stirring, until very
fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the cooked chard leaves,
roasted pepper , and P eppadew pepper . Cook, stirring often,
until the ﬂavors are blended and the chard is hot, about 2
minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl and cover to keep
warm. Do not rinse the pan.
Break each egg into a small teacup. Return the frying pan
to low heat and add the remaining 1 tbsp oil. Carefully slide
the eggs from the teacups into the pan so they stay whole.
Season them with salt, cover the pan, and cook until the
eggs are just set, 2 to 3 minutes.
Place a piece of focaccia on each plate, divide the chard
mixture evenly among the focaccia, top with an egg, and
then spoon a generous blanket of the warm hollandaise
over the top. Serve right away .

Next to rib eye, skirt steak is my favorite cut of beef for its
beefy ﬂavor and appealing texture, which is tender and
chewy at the same time. The muscle ﬁbers in skirt steak
are very long and loose, which creates a particularly juicy
consistency . But take care not to overcook it, because that
juiciness will disappear quickly .
