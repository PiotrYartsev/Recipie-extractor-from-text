FEATURED A ROAST BEEF OR A LEG OF LAMB.  The gravy
was a highly treasured component of the meal.
I learned the method for gravy from my mother , and by the
time I was in college, I had mastered it and was anointed
the oﬀicial gravy maker . And it was pretty easy to make:
pour oﬀ the fat; scrape up the drippings; add a little ﬂour , a
little broth, and a shake of Kitchen Bouquet (hey , it makes
the color great); and voilà, you have a deeply ﬂavored,
savory sauce. Easy .
It stopped being easy the year there were no drippings.
When the roast came out of the oven, the pan looked like it
had been through the dishwasher rather than through two
hours of cradling a juicy roast. That experience taught me
an extremely useful lesson: a gravy , jus, or pan sauce isn’t
hard to make in terms of what the cook has to do, but it is
totally dependent on what the roast beef , chicken, duck, or
the like does ﬁrst. It’s impossible to predict and even
similar cuts of meat won’t behave the same way twice. The
backbone of any of these sauces is the concentrated ﬂavor
contributed by the food’s juices, and if you don’t have
enough, you either don’t have a sauce or you have to ﬁnd
the ﬂavor elsewhere.
I’m structuring this chapter diﬀerently from the others
because I think the most useful information to share is the
basic method for making each of these sauces. So, here you
will ﬁnd a master recipe for gravy , jus, and pan sauce and
ideas for creatively ﬂavoring them.
