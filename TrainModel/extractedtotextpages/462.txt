HINTS AND TIPS:

473* You will need— cutting 
board, cook’s knife, 
vegetable peeler, cup and weight measures, large pot and wooden spoon.
* Vegetable stock can be 
anything from a carefully boiled-up array of root vegetables to the liquid leftover after boiling mixed vegetables for dinner (which can be saved for making soups, making bread or vegan risotto.)
* Sauté the vegetables 
before adding the water to bring out their flavour.
* For a more intensified, 
sweeter tasting stock, roast the vegetables for 45 minutes before cooking in the above method (for 45 minutes).
* The stock will take about 
20 minutes to cook if the vegetables are cut small, or up to 1 hour if they’re kept whole. After an hour, the vegetables are well and truly spent and any herbs left to steep may turn bitter, so strain everything out. (All the flavour and nutrients are now in the liquid, so eating these soggy leftovers would be the equivalent to tucking into boiled cardboard.) To intensify the flavour, you can then reduce the stock by half.* This is an easy stock to 
prepare and have on hand for soups, risotto and sauces; especially for vegetarians and vegans.
* Like all stocks in this 
book, it freezes well and will last for 2 months in the freezer. Keeping stock in the freezer for too long will change the make up of the stock. The ice crystals become larger, affecting the flavour when defrosted.
* For a light amber colour 
to the stock, leave the skin on the onions.
* For a dark vegetable 
stock, brown the vegetables in the pan before adding the water, being careful not to burn the vegetables which would impart a burnt flavour. A simple way to colour the stock is to add some soy sauce or mushroom soy sauce, just enough to change the colour but not to overpower.
* Adding other vegetables 
will certainly add a richness and depth of flavour, but do remember these vegetables are a throwaway item used for flavour only.
* Adding leafy green matter 
like spinach or soft herbs is not a great idea as these ingredients tend to become slimy, bitter or grassy tasting which could affect the final delicate flavour of the stock.
* Homemade vegetable stock 
should be made from quality ingredients, not the old, wilted leftovers fermenting in the bottom of the crisper. As tempting as it may seem to use up the ‘compost’ at the bottom of the fridge, ask yourself, Would I eat these normally? If the answer is, no then discard and use fresher vegetables.
