processor, weight measures 
and plastic scraper.
* This recipe is enough for 
1 flan tin or 23 cm deep pie dish or tart tin.
* Sweet pastry is one of the 
three main French pastries mentioned here. It is also known as ‘pâte sucrée’.
* As the butter is only half 
the quantity to flour, this pastry is easy to work with once rested and gives a good result in any tart or flan —it 
is only bettered by the more delicate sweet shortcrust pastry.
* This pastry is simple 
to do by hand if a food processor is not available. Place the sifted flour and salt in a bowl, and rub in the butter with your fingertips until it reaches a granular texture. Make a well in the centre, add the sugar and eggs, and mix until it forms a smooth dough. Wrap and refrigerate.Method:
1. Place the flour and butter in a food processor and 
blitz until the mixture resembles coarse sand.
2. add the sugar, salt and eggs and continue 
processing until the dough comes together to form a ball.
3. remove the dough to a lightly floured benchtop and 
work briefly until well combined.
4. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until 
required.
