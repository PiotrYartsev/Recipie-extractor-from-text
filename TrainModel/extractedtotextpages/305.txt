 
CREAMY LIME CRÈME ANGLAISE
MAKES ABOUT 2 1/2 CUPS/600 ML
I make this sauce a little richer (thanks to cream) than the
classic version because I like the way the sweet cream
ﬂavor plays oﬀ the perfume of the lime. This sauce is
beautiful served with a blueberry cobbler or pie, a rhubarb
crisp, a simple almond cake, and, of course, the rice
pudding and meringue cookies on page 190.
2 cups/480 ml heavy cr eam
4 egg yolks
1/3 cup/65 g granulated sugar
1/8 tsp k osher salt
1/4 cup/60 ml fr esh lime juice, plus mor e if needed
1 tsp lightly pack ed ﬁnely grated lime zest
Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until
it is just starting to steam; do not let it boil.
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together the egg
yolks, sugar , and salt until well blended. Do not whisk so
much that the mixture gets foamy , however .
When the cream is hot, slowly pour about half of it into
yolk-sugar mixture, whisking constantly until combined.
