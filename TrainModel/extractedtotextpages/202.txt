In a medium saucepan, combine the pancetta, butter ,
garlic, and red pepper ﬂakes over medium heat and cook
until the pancetta has rendered its fat and is lightly
browned around the edges, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the cream,
bring to a simmer , and cook until slightly reduced, about 1
minute longer .
In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and water
until blended. Ladle in a few spoonfuls of the sauce and
whisk immediately so the yolk doesn’t coagulate. Pull the
sauce oﬀ the heat and whisk the yolk mixture into it, along
with both cheeses. Return the pan to very low heat and
cook, stirring occasionally , until slightly thickened, 2 to 3
minutes. T aste and season generously with salt and black
pepper . Keep warm until ready to serve.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 2
days. R eheat very gently so the egg yolk doesn’t cur dle. The
sauce does not fr eeze well.
QUICK CHANGE  Use pr osciuttoinstead of pancetta and
increase the butter to 1 tbsp.
