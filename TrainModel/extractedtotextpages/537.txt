Bain marie, also known as a ‘water bath’, is a method for cooking food such as custards 
and other delicate egg or meat dishes. The food is placed in a dish that is in turn placed in a container of water (usually filled to halfway up the side of the dish), then cooked in an oven or in some cases on the stovetop at a low temperature. The idea is that the water prevents dry heat from scorching the outer parts of the food and produces steam to gently cook the food evenly through to the centre. A cloth, paper towel or newspaper is often placed at the base of the container before the water is added—as insulation to help maintain an even temperature. Bain marie can also refer to the device used to keep food hot at (hopefully) safe temperatures for long periods of time—seen anywhere from cheap snack bars and chicken shops to dubious all-you-can-eat smorgasbords and the more controlled hotel buffets.
Bake is to cook food in the dry heat of an oven. Note that the degree of dryness in the 
oven is determined by the food that is being baked. This means that if a batch of biscuits is in the oven, and then a roast is thrown in as well, the moisture or steam produced from the roast can and most probably will affect the outcome of the biscuits, both in texture and flavour.
Tips for barbequing:
* Barbecue tools are essential and should be maintained with the great care you would give 
a good knife. After use, wash the tools in hot soapy water, rinse and dry well. Store in the 
kitchen drawer or allocated area under your barbecue.
* A wire brush and a long-handled scraper (a paint scraper for windows will do) are 
excellent for cleaning the grill and scraping the hotplate, especially when there is a large build-up on the flat plate. A quality wire brush is essential—spare no expense as the cheaper ones tend to lose their wire bristles which may get left on the grill plate and ultimately end up in the food, undetected and dangerous in small windpipes.
* Paper towel should always be at the ready to wipe down hot or cold barbecues and the 
surrounding area.
* The best time to clean a barbecue is while it is still quite hot. The built-up oil and 
grease is easier to remove when hot. It may not mean doing it immediately after cooking, but for a good clean, turn the barbecue on, get it hot, turn it off and start cleaning.
* As tempting as it is to not scrape down after cooking, residual food and fat become a 
serious attraction to rodents, cockroaches and birds.
* Utilise the wok burner on the side of many barbecues to boil small potatoes and then toss 
in butter and parsley. Or have a pot of hot water on to cook beans or broccoli.
* When cooking red meats (beef, veal and lamb), leave the meat, covered, on the kitchen 
bench and bring to room temperature. This will reduce the cooking time as well as ensuring a more evenly cooked piece of meat.
* White meats (chicken, pork and seafood) should remain refrigerated until cooking as the 
protein is more delicate than in red meats.
* Only add salt to meat just before it is to go on the grill. Seasoning with salt after it 
is cooked is okay, but the meat should rest and seasoning afterwards can draw out moisture. Adding salt too far in advance will draw out the meat’s natural juices and dry it out when it is cooked.
* There is a big difference between well done and cooked beyond recognition. It is entirely 
possible to have a juicy well-done steak—juicy as in moist not blood juicy.
