Crystal dough is the translucent wrapper used specifi  cally for Har Gow (page 55) and 
 Crystal Chive Dumplings (page 63) to let the delicious fi  lling peek through the wrapper. 
Thanks to the sweet potato starch, the uncooked wrapper looks opaque, but it changes 
consistency and texture as it steams. For a pop of color, add ½ teaspoon beet powder or 
ground turmeric to the dough.
3/ 4 cup (96 g) sweet 
potato starch
1/3 cup (40 g) 
tapioca starch
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup (240 g) hot water, 
just boiled
1 tablespoon (14 g) 
canola oil
Cornstarch, for dusting1. In a mixing bowl, stir together the sweet potato 
starch, tapioca starch, and salt.
2. Pour the hot water over the starch mixture and stir 
together until just combined. The mixture will look 
rough and shaggy with some dry spots.
3. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rest for 
10 minutes. This allows the dough time to absorb 
the water and for the steam from the hot water to 
develop the dough’s texture.
4. Add the oil and mix the dough until it becomes 
crumbly.
5. T ransfer the dough to a clean work surface and 
knead the dough with your hands for 4 to 5 minutes, 
or until smooth. If the dough seems a bit sticky, dust 
your hands with cornstarch and keep kneading.
6. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest at room 
temperature for up to 1 hour, covered with a towel to 
keep it warm, so it is pliable for folding.
