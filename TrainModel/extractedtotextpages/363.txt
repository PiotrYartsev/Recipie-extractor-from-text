In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and
water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring
just until the sugar is moistened. Let the mixture boil,
without stirring but with an occasional swirl of the pan,
until it is a deep amber , smells like caramel, and you can
see just the tiniest wisps of smoke, 9 to 12 minutes. The
caramel will be very hot at this point. Remove the saucepan
from the heat and carefully add a little bit of the ginger-
infused cream; the caramel will bubble up furiously .
Return the pan to low heat and whisk in the remaining
cream a little at a time (to avoid bubbling over), then whisk
in the butter and salt. Continue to whisk until the sauce is
very smooth, another minute or so . Remove the pan from
the heat and let the sauce cool in the pan; it will thicken as
it cools. Serve warm or at room temperature.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 3
weeks or fr eeze in a ziplock fr eezer bag for up to 2 months.
QUICK CHANGE  Add 1/2 tsp lightly pack ed Ô¨Ånely grated
orange zest with the butter and salt.
