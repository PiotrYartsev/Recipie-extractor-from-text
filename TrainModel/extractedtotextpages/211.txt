TO FR Y THE SHALLOTS , arrange a double layer of paper
towels on a plate for draining the shallots. P our the oil into
a medium saucepan; it should come to a depth of about 3/4
in/18 mm. (It’s important to use a deep pan and fairly
shallow oil so there’s no danger of the oil boiling over as
you fry .) Attach a candy thermometer to the side of the pan.
Heat over medium-high heat until the thermometer reads
350°F/180°C . Add about a quarter of the shallots and fry ,
stirring almost constantly with a slotted metal spoon or a
skimmer , until pale brown (the color of a grocery bag—any
darker and the shallots will be bitter), about 60 seconds. (If
you don’t have a thermometer , test the oil temperature by
just starting with a few shallots.) W ith the slotted spoon,
quickly scoop out the shallots and drain on the plate of
paper towels. They’ll crisp up as they cool. Repeat with the
remaining shallots in three more batches, transferring each
batch to the plate when done. Allow the oil to return to
350°F/180°C before each batch. If burned bits accumulate
in the oil, scoop them out before adding a new batch.
Sprinkle generously with salt and set aside. (Y ou can fry the
shallots several hours ahead. Once cool, transfer to an
airtight container .)
TO MAKE THE POT ATOES , put the potatoes in a medium
pot, cover with water by about 2 in/5 cm, add 2 tbsp salt,
and bring to a boil. Adjust the heat to a lively boil and cook
until the potatoes are thoroughly tender when pierced with
a knife. Drain in a colander . Put the milk and butter into the
pot, return to low heat, add the potatoes, and mash with a
potato masher , a large fork, or a big wooden spoon. (If you
want your potatoes really smooth, use a ricer or food mill,
but I’m okay with a few chunks.) Add more milk or butter
until you get the consistency you like. Season generosly
with salt and pepper , and keep warm in the pan.
