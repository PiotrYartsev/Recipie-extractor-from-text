Pile the meringue onto the center of the prepared baking
sheet. Using a large spoon or rubber spatula, spread the
meringue in a 9-in/23-cm circle with a slight depression in
the center , like a kiddie pool. Place the meringue in the
oven, reduce the oven temperature to 300°F/150°C/gas 2,
and bake until very dry on the top but still soft in the center
when you press it, 1 to 1 1/4 hours. Don’t let the meringue
brown past a nice shade of ivory .
Turn oﬀ the oven but leave the meringue inside until the
oven is completely cool.
In the stand mixer ﬁtted with the whisk attachment, or with
the handheld electric mixer and a clean medium bowl, beat
the cream on high speed until it holds soft peaks, 1 to 2
minutes. Add the crème fraîche and 1 tbsp of the honey and
beat for a few more seconds to blend. The cream should
hold its shape but not be “curdly .” Taste and fold in a bit
more honey if you want the cream mixture to be sweeter .
Transfer the cooled meringue to a serving plate. Mound the
cream in the center of the meringue and spread it with an
oﬀset spatula or the back of a spoon to make a pretty ,
cloudlike layer . Arrange the fresh fruit artfully over the
cream. Let stand for at least 15 minutes or up to 2 hours (if
it’s not too hot in your kitchen) to allow the cream to meld
with the meringue a bit and the fruit juices to run into the
cream.
Cut into wedges, transfer the slices to dessert plates, and
serve with the coulis spooned around each wedge.
