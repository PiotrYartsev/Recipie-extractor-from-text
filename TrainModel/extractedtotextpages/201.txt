 
CHEATER’S CARBONARA SAUCE
MAKES A SCANT 1 CUP/240 ML
True spaghetti carbonara is one of those alchemical dishes
in which simple ingredients come together in a perfect
moment of harmony and lusciousness—wonderful to eat but
not that easy to pull oﬀ . Here, I’m referencing the ﬂavors in
a carbonara—pancetta or guanciale (two forms of cured
pork related to bacon but not smoked), fresh eggs,
pecorino, and freshly cracked black pepper—but I’m
uniting them all with cream, which allows me to make an
actual sauce that can wait patiently until I’m ready to mix it
with the pasta. This sauce is also good on steamed
asparagus or sautéed chicken breasts, or both, and the
recipe is easily doubled.
