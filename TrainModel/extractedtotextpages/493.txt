meat is whiter, more tender and slightly fattier. Due to disease and the release of a killer virus in 1997, wild rabbits are no longer available on the retail market in New Zealand. Incidentally, possum meat is similar in size and taste to rabbit and therefore rabbit recipes can be easily adapted.
MushrooMs
* Although we think of mushrooms as a vegetable, they are in fact the fruiting bodies of 
higher fungi. The fruiting body is the sexual stage in the life cycle of the fungus.
Tips:
* When buying mushrooms, look for smooth, firm caps, free from major blemishes. The 
mushroom’s surface should be dry but not dried-out looking.
* Store mushrooms in paper bags or, if packaged, remove the plastic wrap and cover loosely 
with paper towel. Place in the refrigerator for 5 days or longer. Avoid airtight plastic 
bags—this causes moisture condensation which speeds degradation.
* Most mushrooms can be frozen successfully—the texture will change, but the flavour won’t. 
(Add to the dish while still frozen.) Delicate mushrooms such as oyster or enoki should not be frozen.
* Brush any dirt or foreign matter from mushrooms with a damp cloth or paper towel. 
Mushrooms shouldn’t be washed as they absorb water. Use a pastry brush to remove other debris clinging to the underneath or stem.
* The white flesh of mushrooms will brown after being sliced. This does not affect the taste 
but you can avoid it by brushing with lemon juice.
* Not all mushrooms should be prepared in the same manner; some shine with most cooking 
methods, in soups, stews, ragoûts, sauces and stir-fries, while others love just oil and butter. European mushrooms do well sautéed or used in cream sauces, while Asian varieties excel in soups and stir-fries.
oil
Tips:
* Always check the use-by date on oil before buying. Oils should also carry a ‘packaged on’ 
date and the closer to the packaged date you can buy an oil, the fresher it is. Be wary of oils that are reduced in price, as they could well be old. 
* Keeping oil in the fridge is not necessary but is an option. Oils higher in fat content, 
such as olive oil, tend to solidify and turn opaque in the fridge. Simply bring to room temperature before use. If preparing freshly chopped garlic or chillies to store in the fridge, it is best to use a vegetable oil to avoid having it solidify in cold storage.
* Buy oil in smaller quantities if you keep it near the stove.
* Keep oil out of direct sunlight. Store in a place that is cool, dry and dark, such as 
a pantry or cupboard. Buying oil in a tin is advantageous, as light cannot penetrate the container.
* All fats and oils eventually break down and become rancid with prolonged exposure to air, 
light and heat. The only way to tell if an oil is old or rancid is to open it and smell.
