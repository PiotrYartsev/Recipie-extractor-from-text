consistency is good, simmer the gravy for another minute
or so to cook oﬀ any raw starch taste.
Slurries are simple to pull together , but they dilute the
sauce by adding water . Cornstarch and water are easy to
blend; ﬂour and water can get lumpy if you are not
careful. Despite the ease with cornstarch, as noted
earlier , I prefer the consistency of ﬂour-thickened gravy .
WHAT TO DO WITH LEFTOVER GRAVY
Other than the obvious—hot turkey or roast beef
sandwiches or reheating leftovers—I exploit my gravy
good fortune in the following ways:
as a binder and ﬂavoring for hash, added to the
potatoes, onions, and meat during the last few
minutes of cooking, so it sizzles a bit
as a pasta sauce, mix ed with grated P armigiano -
Reggiano cheese, fr esh lemon juice, fr esh herbs, and a
little pasta cooking water
to enrich a vegetable soup such as minestr one
to mak e a quick cassoulet, combining canned white
beans, chopped canned tomatoes, and the gravy in a
baking dish, tucking some good sausage into the
beans, and baking until bubbling
to ﬂavor Classic Sher ry Vinaigr ette for using on a
green salad that accompanies cold r oast poultry or
meat or for using on war m smashed new potatoes
Finally , in a pinch, you can use a bouillon cube. Start with
half a cube to make sure you don’t end up with a gravy that
is too salty or tastes like it has been artiﬁcially ﬂavored.
