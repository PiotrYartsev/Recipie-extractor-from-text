and clean, so I use it only with large quantities. The trick,
however , is to begin by puréeing only the solids, adding any
liquid ingredients once you have a thick purée. That way ,
the blades are more eﬀicient and you don’t end up with
solid bits ﬂoating in liquid that sometimes just bounce
around and never become thoroughly pulverized. Do stop
the blender as needed and scrape down the sides with a
rubber spatula, being careful not to push so far down that
the spatula snags on the blades (one of the reasons I hate
blenders).
A FOOD PROCES SOR is a good choice if the main
ingredient you are puréeing is quite soft. If the vegetables
or chile is undercooked, the processor doesn’t always do
the best job of eliminating the graininess. Y ou also need to
scrape down the sides of a food processor midwhirl, but
that’s simple enough to do . A mixture with a lot of liquid
can be trouble, however , because of the hole in the center
of the processor bowl.
A FOOD MILL  is a good old-fashioned piece of equipment
that is fantastic for puréeing potatoes, celery root, and
other fall-apart starchy vegetables and is also brilliant at
separating out skins and seeds. So while the bell pepper
skins in the Smoky Red P epper Coulis  are puréed along
with the ﬂesh of the peppers if you use a blender or food
processor , most of the skins will be strained out if you use a
food mill. This results in a silkier sauce, though some
volume is lost.
This leads me to the issue of straining. I’m all for leaving
things natural if the ﬂavor is satisfactory . But with a sauce,
straining is often worth the extra eﬀort. Not only does it
remove distracting bits of cellulose, but it also aerates the
sauce, adding just a hint more creaminess to the feeling on
your tongue.
