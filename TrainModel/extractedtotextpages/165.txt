 
APPLE CIDER–CHILE BUTTER SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 1/4 CUP/60 ML
A little of this sauce goes a long way , which is why the
recipe yields only 1/4 cup/60 milliliters. It doubles easily ,
however , if you want to make more of it. The key is to
balance the sweet, tang, salt, and spicy heat. Y ou don’t
want the sauce to tip too far to the buttery , sweet-apple
side or it will seem like a dessert sauce. But if you want a
dessert sauce, you can have that, too, by leaving out the
shallot and chile powder and adding only a pinch of salt.
As a savory sauce, drizzle it over a fried ham steak, grilled
sausages served with braised cabbage and onions, or the
roasted Brussels sprouts on page 110. F or a rustic dessert,
drizzle it over fromage frais spread on those lovely British
cookies called wheatmeal digestive biscuits; McV itie’s
brand is especially good.
