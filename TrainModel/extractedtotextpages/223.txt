 
SMOKY RED PEPPER MAYONNAISE
MAKES ABOUT 2 CUPS/480 ML
Spanish smoked paprika, or pimentón  de la V era, comes in
sweet, bittersweet, and hot varieties. I like using the sweet
here because it plays well oﬀ the sweet roasted red pepper ,
but feel free to use whichever kind you like best. If you’re
pressed for time and opt for a jarred roasted red pepper , be
sure to rinse and dry it before adding it to the mayonnaise.
This crimson sauce, which is a bit like the French rouille, is
wonderful on grilled vegetable and mozzarella sandwiches
or as a dip for seared or steamed green beans.
