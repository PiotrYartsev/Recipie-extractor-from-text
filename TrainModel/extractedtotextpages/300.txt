learn to recognize when your custard is at just the right
point.
A perfectionist cook always strains a custard sauce as a
ﬁnal step, but I’m lazy so I don’t strain, unless I see
unwanted bits of egg to banish.
WHAT CAN GO WRONG AND HOW CAN I
FIX IT?
The main danger with a custard sauce is that you overcook
it and it becomes gloppy , curdled, or lumpy . A certain
amount of overcooking can be remedied by passing the
sauce through a ﬁne-mesh sieve (which will strain out
actual bits of egg) and diluting it with a touch more milk or
cream. Y ou can also smooth out a slightly curdled sauce by
whizzing it in a blender or food processor and then
straining it. But a really overcooked custard sauce will
taste too eggy , so if you see “curds,” start again.
Undercooking can be a problem, too, leaving you with a
sauce that is more like wan eggnog. F ortunately , you can
just put the sauce back on low heat and cook it a little
longer , even if you cooked it the day before.
HOW MUCH SAUCE PER SERVING?
This depends on how you are serving the sauce, of course,
but 3 to 4 tablespoons per person would be average.
