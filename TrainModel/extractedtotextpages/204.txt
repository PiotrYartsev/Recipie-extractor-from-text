Scoop them out, leaving any grit in the bottom of the bowl.
Chop the mushrooms and set aside
In a medium, heavy saucepan, melt the butter over
medium-high heat. Add the shallot and celery and cook,
stirring frequently , until soft but not browned, 2 to 3
minutes. Add the cremini and rehydrated mushrooms,
season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring and scraping the
pan frequently , until the mushrooms give oﬀ most of their
liquid and the liquid has evaporated, 4 to 6 minutes. The
mushrooms should smell very mushroomy and be getting
nicely browned.
Add the white wine and stir to dissolve any brown bits on
the pan bottom. R aise the heat to high and simmer until
reduced to about 1 tbsp, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the broth and
boil until reduced to about 1 tbsp, 4 to 6 minutes.
Now add the cream and simmer over medium-high heat
until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 2 to 4
minutes longer . Take the pan from the heat and strain the
sauce through a ﬁne-mesh sieve, pushing on the
mushrooms to extract all of the juices. Return the sauce to
the pan over low heat and add the lemon juice. Heat until
quite warm. Season with salt and pepper . (If using canned
broth, you may not need much or any salt.) If you want to
give the sauce one more boost of savoriness, stir in the
Parmigiano-Reggiano . Keep warm until ready to serve.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 4
days. The sauce does not fr eeze well.
QUICK CHANGE  Add 1 tsp Hungarian sweet paprik a and 2
tbsp chopped fr esh dill to the sauce during the ﬁnal heating.
