HINTS AND TIPS:

469* You will need— cutting 
board, cook’s knife, cup 
measure and large jar with screw-cap lid.
* A sealant may be used 
once the lemons have been placed in the jar. This can be a slick of vegetable oil, enough to cover the surface. Alternatively, use waxed paper and cellophane discs. Make your own from a waxed paper roll purchased from the supermarket. Ensure the rim of the jar is clean and place on top, wax side down, then dampen the cellophane disc, place on top of the rim, moist side up, allow some overhang, and secure with an elastic band. When dry, the cellophane will shrink and create a tight seal.
* When ready, the lemon pulp 
is discarded and only the peel is used.
* Limes can also be 
preserved this way.
* Extra flavourings may be 
added, for example: 1 dried bay leaf, 1 cinnamon stick, 2 whole cloves, 2 dried red chillies, 1 teaspoon black peppercorns, 1 teaspoon coriander seeds, or 
½ 
teaspoon cumin seed. Don’t add all these together.* Preserved lemons can be 
added to stews, fish dishes, stuffings for chicken, tagines and salads.
* Traditionally, thinner 
skinned lemons are utilised because they tend to be juicier. Thick-skinned varieties can be preserved but require extra juice to cover them.
* If a white mould forms, it 
is harmless and can be rinsed off before the lemon is used.
* Six medium-sized lemons fit 
nicely into a 1-litre jar. Don’t be afraid to tightly pack the jar because the lemons shrink.
* Unopened, preserved lemons 
can last 24 months; kept in a dark, dry, cool place.
