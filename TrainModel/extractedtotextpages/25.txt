A Step-by-Step Guide to Doughs and Folds 2727Fold #2: The Pleated Crescent Fold
This shape is the most common and recognizable fold for many Asian dumplings, and 
it is typically used for gyoza, har gow, and potstickers.
1. If using store-bought wrappers, in a small bowl, stir together 1 teaspoon (3 g) 
cornstarch and 1 tablespoon (15 g) warm water to create a cornstarch slurry. 
Skip the slurry if using homemade wrappers. The slurry helps store-bought 
wrappers stick together to seal (they have a drier consistency than homemade 
ones).
2. Lay 1 round wrapper on a cutting board and place 1 tablespoon (weight varies) 
of filling in the center. Use the back of the spoon to flatten the filling slightly.
3. If using store-bought wrappers, dip the tip of your index finger into the slurry 
and moisten the edge of the wrapper all the way around.
4. Pick up the top edge of the wrapper and, working from left to right, make 5 to 
7 overlapping pleats across the edge, keeping the pleats as close together 
as possible.
5. As the pleats form, you’ll notice the wrapper begins to cup around the filling.
