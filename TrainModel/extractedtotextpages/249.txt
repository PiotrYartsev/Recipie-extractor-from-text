 
SAFFRON–RED PEPPER HOLLANDAISE
MAKES ABOUT 1 CUP/240 ML
I doubt if any Provençal cook has ever made this version of
hollandaise, but I liked the way the ﬂavors in it conjured up
a south-of -France feeling as I made it, so I’m projecting a
Provençal connection here. Use a nice, fruity extra-virgin
olive oil to extend the Mediterranean note. This sauce begs
to be served with seafood, especially hot and sizzling from
the grill, and it’s crazy good on a gutsier version of eggs
Florentine .
Jarred Spanish piquillo peppers are excellent in this sauce.
You’ll need about three peppers. Or , you can use regular
jarred roasted red peppers, in which case one medium
pepper should be suﬀicient. And, of course, you can roast
and peel a fresh pepper .
