 
SPICY CURRY-COCONUT CHOCOLATE
SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 1 CUP/240 ML
My inspiration for this sauce is the delicious Naga
chocolate bar made by V osges Haut Chocolat, which pairs
curry spices and coconut with milk chocolate. I have upped
the ante here by adding fresh ginger and a slightly spicy
glow from red pepper ﬂakes. I like serving this sauce over
rice pudding, coconut cream pie, or on crepes ﬁlled with
sautéed bananas. Of course, it’s also divine on Abby
Dodge’s delectable coconut Bundt cake on page 248.
3 tbsp granulated sugar, plus mor e if needed
2 tbsp water
1 tbsp peeled and minced fr esh ginger
1/2 tsp mild cur ry powder

and thinner milk befor e measuring)
Tiny pinch of k osher salt
3 oz/85 g milk chocolate, chopped
In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and water
and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in the
ginger , curry powder , and red pepper ﬂakes. Remove from
