 
COCOA-COCONUT CRÈME ANGLAISE
MAKES ABOUT 1 CUP/240 ML
I’m not sure my instructors at cooking school would have
approved of this version of the classic crème anglaise, but I
adore coconut milk and thought why not? The coconut milk
behaves beautifully in this egg-thickened sauce and
delivers a rich coconut ﬂavor . A standard can of coconut
milk holds 1 3/4 cups/400 milliliters, so with a full can you
can make a double batch of sauce, or save the rest of the
coconut milk for something else. Coconut milk freezes well,
too, or you might look for a smaller can at the store.
The cocoa powder is quite dominant in this sauce, so if you
would like a lighter chocolate ﬂavor , cut the cocoa to 2
teaspoons. This would be a lovely sauce to go with a slice of
ﬂourless chocolate cake, a scoop of chocolate-chunk bread
pudding, or a wedge of coconut Bundt cake like the one on
page 248.
1 tbsp Dutch-pr ocessed unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 cup plus 2 tbsp/220 ml canned coconut milk (stir
together the thick cr eam and thinner milk befor e
measuring)
2 egg yolks
3 tbsp granulated sugar
