2 large eggs
1/2 tsp pur e vanilla e xtract
11/4 cups/300 ml Maple-R um Sabayon
In a medium saucepan, combine the prunes and rum and
bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer for 2 to 3
minutes to cook oﬀ some of the alcohol, then remove from
the heat. Leave the prunes to soak until they are quite soft,
at least 2 hours or up to overnight.
TO MAKE THE CRUST , in a food processor , combine both
ﬂours, the granulated sugar , salt, and cinnamon and pulse
until blended. Scatter the butter pieces over the top, add
the vanilla, and pulse just until the mixture looks like
coarse sand. Add the egg yolk and pulse brieﬂy just to
blend. The dough should be coming together .
Dump the dough onto a clean work surface and blend the
ingredients further by pushing the dough, a little bit at a
time, away from you with the heel of your hand, so that you
“smear” the ingredients together on the work surface. (This
technique is called fraisage in French, and it yields a very
tender crust.) If the dough seems dry , sprinkle a tiny bit of
ice water onto it as you smear . Using a rubber spatula or
bench scraper and your hands, scrape the dough together
and shape it into a ﬂat disk. W rap in plastic wrap and
refrigerate until ﬁrm, about 30 minutes. (Y ou can make the
dough ahead and refrigerate it for up to 2 days or freeze it
for up to 2 months. Thaw frozen dough in the refrigerator
overnight.)
Brush the bottom and sides of a 9-in/23-cm tart pan with a
removable bottom with the melted butter .
Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at
room temperature to soften slightly . It should be cold and
