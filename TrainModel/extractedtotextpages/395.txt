allow the water to boil hard, until the chocolate is melted
and the mixture is smooth.
Remove the bowl from the heat and stir in the cream,
butter , and a tiny pinch of salt until smooth and creamy .
Taste the sauce and add a few more drops of cream if it is
too thick, or a pinch more salt if you are a salt lover . The
sauce will thicken as it cools. Serve warm.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1
month or fr eeze for up to 3 months. If making the sauce
ahead, very gently r eheat it in a saucepan to loosen it up,
adding 2 to 3 tsp very hot water if needed to thin it out.
QUICK CHANGE  Use almond or hazelnut butter instead of
peanut butter .
