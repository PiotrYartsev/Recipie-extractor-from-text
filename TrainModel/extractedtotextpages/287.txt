 
HONEY-GINGER-TANGERINE SABAYON
MAKES 1 1/4 CUPS/300 ML
The ﬂavor of tangerine is soft and lovely and is nicely
ampliﬁed by the perfumed sweetness of honey , rather than
sugar . I reduce most of the tangerine juice to concentrate
its ﬂavor and reserve the balance to deliver a superfresh
note. This sabayon is lovely with berries or over a piece of
ﬂourless chocolate cake.
1 cup/240 ml fr esh tangerine juice
2 tbsp peeled and coarsely chopped fr esh ginger (fr om a 1-
oz/30-g piece)
4 egg yolks
1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp/75 ml honey
Pinch of k osher salt
In a small saucepan, combine 3/4 cup/180 ml of the
tangerine juice and the ginger and bring to a simmer over
medium-high heat. Simmer until reduced to about 3 tbsp, 6
to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly .
Strain through a ﬁne-mesh sieve into a small bowl, pushing
on the ginger with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to
force out all of its juice.
