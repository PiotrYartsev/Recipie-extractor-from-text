 
CREAMY, LEMONY BUTTER SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 1/2 CUP/120 ML

butter sauces to ensure a stable emulsion (meaning the
sauce will be less likely to separate if it’s kept warm for a
while before serving). The only time I add cream is when I
want the ﬂavor and texture of the addition to be part of the
character of the sauce. Here, the cream helps take the
sharp edge oﬀ the wine-vinegar reduction, which means
that you can use a bit less butter … so you can think of this
as a low-fat sauce!
