Here is a classic dipping sauce to serve with dumplings. The acidity in the vinegar helps cut 
through the richness of the dumplings. When having people over, make a triple batch and 
provide everyone with a small dish of their own so they can double dip all they want.
1/ 4 cup soy sauce
3 tablespoons black vinegar
2 teaspoons sugar
1 teaspoon paper-thin 
sliced scallion, green 
part only
Cooking tiP: Black vine-
gar is like Chinese balsamic 
vinegar. If you can’t find 
black vinegar, substitute 
21/2 tablespoons balsamic 
vinegar plus 2 teaspoons rice 
vinegar.In a small saucepan over low heat, combine the 
soy sauce, vinegar, 2 tablespoons water, and the 
sugar. Heat for 5 minutes, or until the sugar is dis-
solved.  Remove from the heat and transfer to a small 
bowl. Sprinkle in the scallion.
