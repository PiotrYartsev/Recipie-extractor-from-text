6. Now , add the next liquid. This is what will make up the
bulk of the sauce. The most common liquid is some kind
of broth. Homemade broth is best, of course, but if you
use a canned broth, choose a reduced-sodium one.
When you reduce any liquid that contains salt, the
saltiness becomes more concentrated. Cook this liquid
down by about two-thirds.
7. Add some ﬂavor accents. This might be Dijon mustard,
fresh herbs, fresh fruit, black olives, green
peppercorns, or the like. Y ou want to use an ingredient
that will taste great in the sauce but won’t require a lot
of transformation.
8. Enrich the sauce with cream or butter . At this point, you
have a lot of concentrated ﬂavors, including some
sharp ones, and you need to decide whether everything
tastes good just as it is, or whether you need to polish
oﬀ the sharp edges with cream or butter . Keep in mind
that such fats don’t just enrich a sauce, they also
unlock and spread ﬂavors, so that even a small amount
can be a catalyst to the other ﬂavors in the sauce.
9. The last decision is whether you want to strain or not. I
generally don’t strain because I don’t mind texture, but
if you’re looking for those few drops of perfectly
smooth essence, then strain.
10. Taste and adjust your seasoning.
