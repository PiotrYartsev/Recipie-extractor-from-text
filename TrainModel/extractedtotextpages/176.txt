Heat the oven to 400°F/200°C/gas 6. Line a rimmed baking
sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil.
Grate the potato on the large holes of a box grater . As you
work, don’t apply too much pressure, as you want fairly
thin shavings. Season the grated potato with salt and
pepper and toss with the melted butter .
If the ﬁsh ﬁllets are thick on one end, thin on the other , fold
the thin end under to make neat ﬁllets of uniform
thickness. Spread an equal amount of the mustard on top of
each ﬁllet and season with a little salt and pepper . Divide
the potato evenly among the ﬁllets, gently patting it on top
and pressing lightly so it sticks.
Arrange the ﬁllets on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until
the ﬁsh is just opaque at the center when tested with a
knife and the potatoes are golden brown and crisp around
the edges, 15 to 18 minutes. If the ﬁsh is almost cooked but
the potato topping isn’t crisp, switch the oven to broil for
the last few minutes.
Transfer the ﬁllets to warmed individual plates and spoon a
ribbon of the beurre rouge around each ﬁllet. Serve right
away .
