Transfer the puﬀs to a cooling rack. W ith the tip of a small
knife, poke a tiny hole in the side of each puﬀ to let steam
escape. This keeps them from getting soggy .
TO MAKE THE FILLING , put 1/4 cup/50 g of the sugar and
the water in a small, heavy saucepan over medium-high
heat and cook, swirling the pan occasionally as the sugar
starts to melt, until the sugar is a deep amber , has a very
fragrant caramel smell, and you see just the tiniest wisps of
smoke, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and
carefully pour in 1 cup/240 ml of the cream; it will steam
and sputter , so stand back a bit. Return the pan to the heat
and stir to dissolve the caramel. Stir in the espresso
powder and cardamom until combined and dissolved. K eep
the caramel cream warm over very low heat; do not let it
boil.
In a medium stainless-steel bowl, whisk together the egg
yolks, the remaining 1/4 cup/50 g sugar , the ﬂour , and the
salt until thoroughly blended. P our in a bit of the hot
caramel cream and whisk vigorously to blend into a paste.
Add a little more caramel cream, whisk to blend, and then
whisk the egg mixture back into the pan of caramel cream.
Return the pan to medium-high heat and bring to a boil,
whisking constantly . The pastry cream will thicken as it
cooks; if it starts getting a little lumpy , just pull it from the
heat and whisk away the lumps. Cook at a gentle boil for
about 2 minutes to cook oﬀ the raw ﬂour taste. Remove the
pan from the heat and let the pastry cream cool completely ,
whisking occasionally to prevent a skin from forming on
top.
In a medium bowl with a handheld electric mixer , whip the
remaining 1/2 cup/120 ml cream on medium-high speed
until it forms ﬁrm peaks. Whisk the cooled pastry cream to
loosen it slightly , then carefully fold about one-fourth of the
