 
ALMOST CREAMLESS CREAMY VELOUTÉ
SAUCE
MAKES 3 CUPS/720 ML
A traditional velouté sauce is broth thickened with a roux,
but the texture is so smooth and velvety (which is what
velouté  means) that it’s hard to believe that it doesn’t
contain cream. Because the sauce is all about the broth,
use a homemade one, or buy a good-quality broth from a
gourmet store. Everyday canned broth won’t cut it for this
recipe. Choose the type—chicken, ﬁsh, or veal—depending
on what you intend to do with the sauce, though I ﬁnd that
chicken broth is all-purpose and will even complement
seafood. I like to add a good splash of cream at the end to
round out the ﬂavors.
4 tbsp/55 g unsalted butter
1/4 cup/30 g all-purpose ﬂour
4 cups/960 ml homemade or stor e-bought good-quality
reduced-sodium chick en, ﬁsh, or veal br oth
1/4 cup/60 ml heavy cr eam or cr ème fraîche
Kosher salt and fr eshly gr ound black pepper
In a medium saucepan, combine the butter and ﬂour over
medium-high heat and whisk to blend as the butter melts.
