act as a buﬀer for the pan. Should you use a roasting rack?
That is subjective. I know some expert cooks who insist on
a rack and others who don’t. I don’t use a rack because I
am lazy .
THE AROMA TICS  In addition to protecting against the
evaporation and burning of juices, aromatic vegetables can
add ﬂavor to the ﬁnal gravy , so you might want to include
some anyway . A few lemon slices, garlic cloves, or sprigs of
thyme or rosemary are nice accents, too . Don’t go
overboard or your gravy will end up tasting like vegetable
soup. Plan on about 1 cup/140 grams diced aromatic
vegetables for a 3-to 4-pound/1.4-to 1.8-kilogram roast.
You can also ﬁll open space in your roasting pan with meat
scraps or meaty bones, which will amplify the savory
quotient of your gravy . An extra turkey neck; some chicken
necks, backs, or wings; some pork ribs; or some beef ribs
or meaty soup bones are all fairly inexpensive and good
insurance. Turkey and chicken necks yield succulent bits of
meat (stand-ins for giblets without the taste of organ meats
for those who don’t like the latter) to add to a poultry
gravy .
THE LIQUID  A good broth is the main ingredient of a gravy .
Make it from scratch if you can; it will keep for weeks in
your freezer . I think turkey broth is a great all-purpose
liquid for just about any gravy , so it is my standard and I’m
including a recipe for it in this chapter . I am not opposed to
using good store-bought broth, but be sure to choose a
reduced-sodium one, and I use chicken broth even for
roasted meats. I have yet to ﬁnd a commercial beef broth
that has a good ﬂavor . Water is just ﬁne, too, though only if
you have superior drippings to provide the ﬂavor .
