Tips:
* When I speak of eggs, I mean the freshest possible eggs you can get your hands on: their 
flavour is incomparable. If, like me, you’re an egg snob, the best place to buy eggs is at 
a local market direct from the farmer. Alternatively, the next best eggs are free range or organic.
* To set the record straight, a rooster is not needed for egg production in itself but for 
producing fertile eggs—that is, eggs that will hatch a chick after incubation. A rooster is good for waking people up at an ungodly hour, attacking the hand that feeds it, and mating with an entire yardful of hens. (Fertilised eggs can be eaten if they are collected as soon as they are laid—it takes 21 days of a hen sitting on an egg continuously to develop it into a chick.) Fertile and infertile eggs are equally nutritious. 
* Brown eggs and white eggs are exactly the same in flavour, quality and nutrition—the 
pigmentation is genetic, not to do with a hen’s diet or condition. Eggs only vary in flavour according to the conditions the hens are kept in.
* A blood spot on a yolk is not a sign that an egg has been fertilised; it simply shows 
that a blood vessel on the yolk’s surface burst while the egg was forming.
* Store eggs in the fridge in their cardboard box. (Eggs are porous and absorb odours from 
the fridge, which taints their natural flavour; the box will help protect them.)
* Buy eggs with a plan in mind. If baking a cake which may only use one or two eggs, plan 
on making an omelette or other egg-based dishes within a day or two of purchase.
* For cake and pastry recipes, room temperature eggs are a must, so remove from the fridge 
and rest on the bench for at least half an hour before starting the recipe. A cold egg mixed with room temperature batter will seize or cool the mixture and won’t mix in smoothly. Without a smooth, airy emulsion at this stage, a cake or pastry may become dry and grainy in texture or flat in appearance, cook unevenly or even sink slightly.
* Cream of tartar can also be used to stabilise egg whites: use 1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar 
for 1 egg white.
* When whipping egg whites, remember that there are four definitive stages that the whites 
go through. Stage 1 is the just beaten ‘foamy’ stage: the bubbles are big and the whites are still quite runny. Stage 2 is ‘soft peak’ where beating takes the whites to a foam which is white, shiny and forms a soft peak that folds over as the beater is lifted from the whites. Stage 3 is ‘firm peak’ where the whites have been beaten to their maximum size. It will form a stable peak of fine white foam when the beater is removed. The last stage (4) is known as ‘dry foam’. The foam is much drier, with no sheen and forms clumps. When the beaters are lifted, the ‘dry foam’ tends to break easily. This last stage is to be avoided.
* Beating egg whites in a copper bowl is proven to enhance the stability of the egg whites 
by imparting tiny copper particles. The slightly golden colour is a natural and safe result of the copper bowl. The only drawback is the expense and upkeep involved in owning copperware. A pinch of cream of tartar can also stabilise beaten egg whites so that they are less likely to fall apart.
