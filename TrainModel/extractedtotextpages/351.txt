Something about this cherry sauce makes me crave lamb,
and meatballs are one of my favorite ways to enjoy lamb.
Both sauce and meat are slightly sweet, so be sure to dial
the spice heat level high enough to provide contrast. The
simply steamed greens also deliver a welcome earthiness.
You can make the meatballs and the sauce up to a day
ahead, so you don’t need to juggle too many last-minute
cooking chores.
