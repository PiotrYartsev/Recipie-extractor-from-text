In a small, heavy saucepan, cook the sugar over low heat,
stirring frequently so the sugar doesn’t burn around the
edges, until the sugar turns a deep copper color , about 10
minutes from when you turn on the burner .
Remove the pan from the heat, add the vinegar , and stir to
dissolve the caramel (this is the gastrique). Stir in the
berries, shallot, water , chile powder , 1/4 tsp salt, and a few
grinds of pepper . Return to low heat, cover , and simmer
until the berries have softened and released their juices, 4
to 5 minutes.
Scrape everything into a food processor and whiz until
smooth (aside from the blackberry seeds). Strain through a
ﬁne-mesh sieve into a small bowl, using a wooden spoon or
rubber spatula to push as many solids through as you can.
You will end up with 2 to 3 tbsp seeds, which you can toss
out.
Stir the basil into the blackberry purée. T aste and adjust
with more salt, pepper , vinegar , and sugar if needed. Serve
warm or at room temperature.
STORAGE  Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5
days or fr eeze for up to 2 months.
QUICK CHANGE  Add 1 tsp chopped fr esh tar ragon with the
basil.
