 
GRAPEFRUIT-CORIANDER BUTTER SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 1/2 CUP/120 ML
Grapefruit is my favorite fruit, and my perfect grapefruit
variety is a Rio Star red grapefruit from T exas, harvested in
March. I ﬁnd the end-of -season fruit intensely sweet and
perfumed, but always with the subtle, intriguing grapefruit
tickle of bitter and sour . I am using the zest, juice, and ﬂesh
of the fruit in this sauce, so it’s a real celebration of this
refreshing fruit. The small amount of ground coriander and
ginger underscores the fruit ﬂavor , and the slight anise
ﬂavor in the basil is a beautiful accent. Try this on big, fat
seared sea scallops, grilled mackerel, grilled chicken
breast, or steamed asparagus spears.
