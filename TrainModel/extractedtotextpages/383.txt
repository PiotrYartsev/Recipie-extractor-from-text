removed. Y ou may be surprised at how rich and glossy a
sauce made from cocoa powder can be. I like the bolder
ﬂavor of a natural cocoa, but Dutch-processed cocoa is ﬁne
in a sauce, too . My favorite cocoa powder is a highfat one
(with about 25 percent cocoa butter) from P enzeys
(penzeys.com).
SUGAR  Whether or not I add sugar to my sauces depends

chocolate sauces. It doesn’t make the sauce taste salty , but
rather it adds dimension to the overall ﬂavor proﬁle of the
sauce.
WHAT CAN GO WRONG AND HOW CAN I
FIX IT?
There are two things to worry about when working with
chocolate: scorching it and having it seize up (that is, turn
into a grainy mass). But I’ve developed all of the recipes
here so that these common chocolate pitfalls are not an
issue. I don’t heat or melt the chocolate on its own (the
easiest way to accidentally scorch it), and I always add
enough liquid to the chocolate to eliminate the risk of
seizing. (T o learn more about seizing, see facing page.)
One tip to keep in mind: be sure you’ve chopped your
chocolate uniformly and ﬁnely enough so that it melts
evenly . The typical thin 3-to 4-ounce/85-to 115-gram bar of
chocolate is easy to chop with a chef ’s knife; just start at a
corner and chop your way into the bar . As that corner
