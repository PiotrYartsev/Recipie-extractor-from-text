WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
BITTERSWEET AND SEMISWEET
CHOCOLATE?
The chocolate industry has not standardized these terms,
which makes deciding which chocolate to buy confusing.
According to the U .S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), any chocolate that contains at least 35 percent
chocolate liquor (another name for the ground cacao
beans, which are made up of cocoa solids and cocoa
butter , that become chocolate) can be called semisweet
or bittersweet chocolate.
To confuse us even further , many chocolates now list the
percentage of cocoa solids, usually expressed as cacao,
they contain. The more cocoa solids in the chocolate, the
fewer other ingredients it contains, so the chocolate
ﬂavor is more intense and possibly more bitter . For
instance, it is safe to presume that a chocolate with 72
percent cacao will taste more bitter than one with 60
percent cacao .
But it’s not always as simple as high percentage equals
more bitter . That’s because cacao percentage includes
the cocoa butter content as well, and extra cocoa butter
can be added to chocolate to give it a smoother ﬂavor . In
the end, it usually comes down to a matter of taste. Each
type of chocolate will have a diﬀerent ﬂavor proﬁle,
depending on the source of the cacao beans, how long
the beans were roasted, the amount of sugar or extra
cocoa butter , and the addition of vanilla or other
ﬂavorings. The term dark chocolate is not regulated, so it
can mean anything. But it is a good umbrella term for the
range of semisweet and bittersweet, and it tells you that
the chocolate isn’t milk or white. I use the term dark in
