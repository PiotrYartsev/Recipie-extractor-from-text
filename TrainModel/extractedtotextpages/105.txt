COMFORTING RISOTTO with VERY MEATY
TOMATO SAUCE
SERVES 4
I generally like to keep my risotto as a fairly light dish so
the rice really shines, but it can also be delicious in a more
robust form, as in this recipe. It’s sort of the diﬀerence
between sliding a cashmere cardigan around my shoulders
and bundling up in a chunky Irish ﬁsherman sweater .
Look for Arborio rice in well-stocked grocery stores. Be
sure to buy an Italian brand, as I have found the domestic
brands are not as good. Carnaroli rice, which has a
particularly high starch content and ﬁrm texture, is also a
good choice for making risotto . Fior di Riso is my favorite
brand, as much for the charming mistranslations on the
packaging as for the excellent quality of the rice.
