 
ROMESCO SAUCE
MAKES 2 CUPS/480 ML
My friend and fellow food writer Matthew Card makes a
mean romesco, so I asked him to contribute his recipe to
the book. If he hadn’t, I would have been trying to
duplicate his version of the classic Spanish sauce anyway ,
so he spared me the espionage. His sauce gets most of its
body from ﬂeshy roasted red peppers—from a jar is ﬁne—
but gets layers of can’t-stop-eating-this ﬂavor from fried
bread, two kinds of nuts, and a bit of sherry vinegar .
