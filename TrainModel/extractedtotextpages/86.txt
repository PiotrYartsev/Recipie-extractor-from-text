The spiciness and sourness of this soup balance out the rich Beef and Scallion Dumplings 
(page 41). Try using thicker dumpling wrappers—the wrappers will soak up the soup and 
get even tastier!
4 dried shiitake mushrooms
1/ 4 cup unseasoned 
rice vinegar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons light 
soy sauce
2 teaspoons sugar
1 tablespoon Chili Crisp 
Sauce (page 99) or 
store-bought chili oil
1 teaspoon ground 
white pepper
1/ 4-inch piece fresh ginger, 
peeled and minced
4 cups chicken stock
4 ounces firm tofu, rinsed 
and cut into 1/ 4-inch strips
1 batch cooked Beef 
and Scallion Dumplings 
(page 41)
2 scallions, white and green 
parts, thinly cut on the 
diagonal
Make it easier: Make a few 
batches of dumplings to keep 
in the freezer, so you can have 
this delicious soup in a matter 
of minutes.1. Place the mushrooms in a heat-proof bowl and cover 
them with boiling water. Soak for about 20 minutes 
until softened. Drain the mushrooms, reserving 
1/ 4 cup of soaking liquid in a small bowl. Thinly slice 
the mushrooms and set aside.
2. Stir the vinegar, cornstarch, soy sauce, sugar, chili 
crisp sauce, white pepper, and ginger into the 
reserved mushroom liquid until the cornstarch and 
sugar dissolve. Set aside.
3. In a large saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a 
boil. Reduce the heat to medium to keep a simmer 
and stir in the sliced mushrooms. Simmer for 
about 2 minutes.  Stir in the tofu and simmer for 
2 minutes more.
4. Give the cornstarch mixture a quick stir and stir it 
into the pot. T urn the heat to medium-high and cook 
the soup for about 30 seconds, stirring, until thick -
ened. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. 
5. Divide the cooked dumplings and soup among 4 to 
6 warmed bowls. Garnish with scallions to serve.
