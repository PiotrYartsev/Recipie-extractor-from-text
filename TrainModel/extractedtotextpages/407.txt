about 15 minutes, if you have the time.
Fit a pastry bag with a plain small tip, spoon the ﬁlling into
the bag, and ﬁll each puﬀ by poking the tip into the puﬀ

a bit attached so you don’t separate the top and bottom
halves. Gently open up each puﬀ , spoon some ﬁlling into
the center , and pat the top back in place.
Pile ﬁve ﬁlled puﬀs onto each dessert plate or into each
shallow bowl. Gently heat the chocolate sauce and either
drizzle an equal portion over each serving, or bring the
sauce to the table and let the diners pour the sauce
themselves. Serve right away .
