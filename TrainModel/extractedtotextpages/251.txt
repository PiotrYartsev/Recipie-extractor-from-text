DO I NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE EGG
YOLKS?
I’d love to be able to say unequivocally that it’s always
safe to eat a hollandaise sauce, but I’m afraid I can’t do
it. There will always be a small risk of salmonella in foods
with egg yolks that reach only about 140°F/60°C when
the sauce is ﬁnished cooking. The temperature for
ultimate food safety is 160°F/70°C . With that said, unless
you’re pregnant, very young, very old, or have a
compromised immune system, the yolks in a hollandaise
are suﬀiciently cooked and the risk of a foodborne illness
is minimal. If you’re worried, you can use pasteurized
eggs, but the ﬂavor and texture of the ﬁnished sauce
won’t be the same. Another way to minimize the risk is to
buy the freshest eggs you can ﬁnd, refrigerate them the
moment you get them home, and serve the ﬁnished sauce
right away .
