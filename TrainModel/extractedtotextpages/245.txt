 
LIME–BROWN BUTTER HOLLANDAISE
MAKES ABOUT 1 CUP/240 ML
Here, the butter ﬂavor of the hollandaise is ampliﬁed
thanks to browning. The butter develops a lovely nuttiness
that tastes especially good in the sauce. This is a gorgeous
partner for crab cakes and other seafood, grilled chicken
breasts, and just about any vegetable, but especially
asparagus.
3/4 cup/170 g unsalted butter
2 egg yolks
2 tbsp fr esh lime juice, plus mor e if needed
Kosher salt
1/2 tsp lightly pack ed ﬁnely grated lime zest
Dash of hot-pepper sauce such as Sriracha
In a small, heavy saucepan or frying pan, melt the butter
over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, keep
cooking it. It will sizzle and foam as the water cooks oﬀ .
Keep cooking, scraping the bottom of the pan with a heat-
resistant rubber spatula or wooden spoon as the milk solids
in the butter turn a light golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes.
Once the butter becomes very fragrant and smells toasty ,
remove the pan from the heat and let the butter cool
slightly .
