 
ORANGE-ROSEMARY BALSAMIC BUTTER
SAUCE
MAKES ABOUT 1/2 CUP/120 ML
This sauce is so delicious that I found myself eating it with
a spoon during the testing sessions for this book, but really
it’s meant to be drizzled around a sautéed pork medallion
or seared scallop. The concentrated balsamic vinegar turns
the sauce a lovely , glossy brown, almost like a chocolate
sauce. Use a decent vinegar but not an artisanal one. I like
Lucini brand, they charge a fair price for a good-quality
balsamic vinegar to use for cooking, rather than as a
condiment.
1/4 cup/60 ml balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup/60 ml fr esh orange juice
1 tsp minced shallot or yellow onion
1 fresh r osemary sprig, 4 in/10 cm long
4 to 5 tbsp very cold unsalted butter in one lar ge piece, plus
1/2 tbsp if needed
Kosher salt
In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar , orange juice,
shallot, and rosemary and bring to a simmer over medium-
high heat. Cook, stirring and scraping the sides of the pan
