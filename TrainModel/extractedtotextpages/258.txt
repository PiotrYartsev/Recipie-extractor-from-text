The twice-cooked method for the
potatoes here is borrowed from
classic french fry–making
technique. The ﬁrst round of
cooking makes the potatoes
tender and the second makes
them crisp. This dish is a perfect
bistro-at-home dinner , so serve it
with a simple green salad and a
glass of Beaujolais or Côtes du
Rhône.
