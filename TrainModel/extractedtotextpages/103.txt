want your eggs cooked through a bit more, keep them
under the broiler for another 30 seconds.
Put a piece of toast in the bottom of each individual wide,

sauce over each toast. Serve right away .
CHICKEN AND PEPPERS BRAISED IN VERY
MUSHROOMY PORCINI TOMATO SAUCE
SERVES 4 TO 6
This easy and savory stew was inspired by chicken
cacciatore, that is, “hunter’s style” stew . The idea is that a
hunter bags a bird, then forages some lovely mushrooms in
the forest on the way home. I’m not sure where the peppers
come from, perhaps a neighbor’s garden? In any case, the
ﬂavors are deep and bold and satisfying, particularly
during the colder months.
You can use any cut of chicken you like. I’m a true believer
in the skin-on, bone-in chicken thigh. I think it’s the only
part of modern chickens that has any ﬂavor , and the texture
stays moist no matter how long you cook it. I also like the
bites of chicken close to the bone, which are particularly
tender and ﬂavorful. But if you prefer boneless and
skinless, that’s ﬁne too . The stew is especially delicious
with good-quality egg noodles or homemade spaetzle.
