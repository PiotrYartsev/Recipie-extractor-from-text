Pour water to a depth of 1 to 2 in/2.5 to 5 cm into a medium
saucepan and placeover medium heat. Rest a medium
stainless-steel bowl in the pan over (nottouching) the water .
Put the egg yolks, vinegar , water , and 1/4 tsp salt in the
bowl and start whisking. As the bowl heats up, the yolks
will begin to thicken. Whisk vigorously , scraping around the
bowl with a heat-resistant rubber spatula from time to time
so that bits of yolk don’t get stuck and overcook. Beat until
thick and frothy but not quite ﬂuﬀy , 3 to 4 minutes. The
whisk will start leaving a clear space on the bottom of the
bowl. Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk for another
30 seconds or so to stabilize the sauce and let the bowl cool
down.
Continue whisking as you slowly drizzle in the warm melted
butter , taking care not to add the milky-watery layer from
the bottom of the pan. As you pour and whisk, make sure
the yolks are accepting the butter and the yolks and butter
are emulsifying. If the sauce looks at all broken or “curdly ,”
stop adding butter and just whisk for a few seconds. Only
resume adding butter once you’ve whisked the sauce into
creaminess again.
Once all of the butter has been added, whisk in the soy
sauce mixture and lemon zest. T aste and adjust the
seasoning with salt and vinegar if needed. If possible, serve
right away .
STORAGE : This sauce is best eaten right af ter you mak e it,
but you can hold it in the double boiler over very low heat or
in a ther mos for up to 1 hour . Refrigerate lef tovers in an
airtight container for up to 3 days.
QUICK CHANGE : Fold in 2 tbsp chopped fr esh tar ragon with
the lemon zest.
