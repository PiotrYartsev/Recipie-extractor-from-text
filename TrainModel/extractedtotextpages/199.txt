 
SPICY SAFFRON–RED PEPPER CREAM
SAUCE
MAKES 1 CUP/240 ML
The French pair saﬀron and seafood beautifully in a variety
of dishes, such as bouillabaisse and soupe de poissons, and
I’m doing it here in a sauce that’s fantastic with seafood
and pasta. I call for a mix of chicken or turkey broth and
ﬁsh stock or bottled clam juice, but if you have good
homemade ﬁsh stock, use only that. Bottled clam juice adds
a briny ocean ﬂavor , but it can be salty , so take special care
to taste before your ﬁnal seasoning—as you should with
every dish.
