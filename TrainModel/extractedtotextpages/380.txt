In a medium saucepan, combine the cardamom, cloves,
cinnamon stick, sugar , water , and salt and bring to a
simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to
medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the
heat, strain through a Ô¨Åne-mesh sieve, and return the syrup
to the pan. Add the apricots and simmer over medium heat
until they are soft and the liquid is largely absorbed, 10 to
15 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, let cool, and add the lemon
juice to taste.
Fill the bottom of each parfait glass with 1/4 cup/60 ml ice
cream. Divide half of the apricot mixture equally among the
glasses, top with half of the pistachios, and drizzle with half
of the caramel sauce. Repeat with the remaining ice cream
and apricots; drizzle the tops with the remaining caramel
sauce and sprinkle with the remaining pistachios. Tuck a
mint sprig into each glass, if you like, and serve right away .
