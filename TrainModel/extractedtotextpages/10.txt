11 Dumplings Made Simple STOCK YOUR FREEZER
The best thing about making multiple batches of dumplings is you can freeze them 
to have a stash of dumplings ready to go. Y ou’ll have delicious dumplings in minutes 
without having to make them from scratch.
Y ou can also freeze dumpling components ahead of time, such as dumpling wrap-
pers, fillings, stocks, and soups.
Wontons and dumplings made with basic dumpling wrappers can be frozen raw, 
then cooked from frozen. Steamed baos and crystal dumplings are best frozen after 
cooking, then reheated. Y ou can also freeze Basic Dumpling Dough (page 20) wrappers 
on their own, as long as they are prerolled and stacked with wax paper between them. 
Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and make sure you label and date the package.
