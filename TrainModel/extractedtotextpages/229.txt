MAKES ABOUT 1 1/2 CUPS/360 ML
Aioli, a garlic-infused version of mayonnaise, is a wonderful
way to add Mediterranean ﬂavor to any dish. But I think my
taste buds must be more Swedish than Mediterranean
because most of the aioli I taste is too harshly garlicky for
me. This version tempers that bite but still delivers full
garlic ﬂavor in two forms: oil-poached cloves (or garlic
conﬁt) and garlic-ﬂavored oil. Y ou can use this sauce with
lightly steamed or grilled vegetables, fried shrimp, or crab
cakes, or you can stir it into a seafood stew at the last
minute for a creamy note (but don’t let it boil).
