The Basics: a really useful cookB ook 562Oven temperatures
A common frustration for many cooks is trying to decipher what a ‘moderate’ or ‘slow’ oven 
is. Conversions between gas marks, Celsius and Fahrenheit can also be confusing. To prove conclusively that cooking really does have an element of guesswork to it, we have four columns of oven settings, all of which are only close to an exact reading. It is highly recommended that an ‘ovenproof’ thermometer be used. Often domestic and even professional ovens have a malfunctioning thermostat which can really have an effect on baked goods.
