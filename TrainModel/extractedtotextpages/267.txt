I also like Savory Choice, which comes in small tubes like
ketchup packets. The ﬂavor of the chicken and the turkey is

absorb and expand, so give it some time before you add

added to the gravy in the same way as you add beurre
manié, with the gravy at a simmer and whisking in a

Always allow a minute or so for the gravy to thicken
before evaluating the consistency . And once the
