The Basics: a really useful cookB ook 500Lemons
Tips:
* Lemons are a rich source of vitamin C and their ascorbic acid content prevents 
oxidisation. Use lemon juice to stop some fruit and vegetables from browning, like bananas, 
apples and artichokes.
* Always wash and dry lemons before using the zest in cooking. This removes dust, mould 
and dirt which could affect the dish being cooked; and in the case of non-organic lemons, removes the insecticides, colour dye or wax they can be sprayed with (these can all be removed with soapy water).
* When grating the zest, place a piece of baking or silicon paper over the outside of the 
grater where it will stick to the rough edges. Grate to your heart’s content, peel off the paper and all the zest will come off with it.
* To get more juice from a lemon, roll it on the benchtop, applying pressure with the palm 
of your hand. This ‘bruising’ tenderises the membranes within the lemon. Or place the lemon in the microwave for 20–30 seconds before juicing.
* Leftover lemon juice can be frozen in ice–cube trays and when frozen kept in a clip–lock 
bag. Lemon zest also freezes well.
* For a dinner party, lemon halves wrapped and tied in muslin make an attractive addition 
to the table. A half lemon should last each person the entire meal, and the muslin prevents the seeds from popping everywhere.
meat
One way of thinking about different types of meat —rather than the usual divide between 
white and red—is whether the animal is ruminant or non-ruminant. Ruminant refers to any cud-chewing or cloven-hoofed animal with four legs. Keep in mind that recipes for one animal could lend themselves to another. Horsemeat, although not eaten in many countries, is popular in many European countries, especially Belgium, France and Sweden, where it outsells lamb and mutton combined. 
The best mince meat is the type you make yourself. If you don’t have a mincing 
machine, try cutting larger pieces of meat (usually scraps, off-cuts or cheaper cuts like skirt or flank) into 1–2 cm pieces before putting in the food processor on pulse so you can control how finely it is chopped. Hand-cutting meat for a good meat sauce is better left to a chef.
