Brush the bread slices on both sides with the remaining 2
tbsp oil. Place on the grill rack or on a baking sheet under
the broiler and grill or broil, turning once, until nicely
toasted on both sides. Set aside.
Pour the stock into the tomato mixture and crumble in the
saﬀron. Simmer to reduce the liquid slightly and
concentrate the ﬂavors, about 5 minutes. Add the ﬁsh
chunks, stir to make sure they are completely covered by
liquid, and simmer until the ﬁsh is opaque throughout, 3 to

a big spoonful of the mayonnaise. Sprinkle with the parsley
and serve immediately , with a knife and fork as well as a
spoon.
