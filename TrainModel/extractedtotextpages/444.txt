HINTS AND TIPS:

455* You will need— bowl, 
spoon, liquid and weight 
measures, wooden spoon, rolling pin or pasta machine, baking tray, baking paper and wire rack.
* Lavosh is a versatile 
unleavened, yeast-free crisp bread that is easy to make at home. A pasta machine will give a quick result with minimum fuss.
* Lavosh is perfect to 
serve with cheese, dips and antipasto at a light lunch or dinner party.
* Try adding 1 tablespoon 
lemon zest to the recipe for a lovely flavour and aroma.
* Try replacing the poppy 
seeds with 1 tablespoon chilli flakes.
* Lavosh dough can be kept 
refrigerated for 3– 5 days, 
after which it will begin to grey and lose its fresh flavour. The dough freezes well for 1– 2 months. Defrost 
in the fridge before using.
* Cut the rolled out dough 
into different shapes. Use a round scone cutter to make a biscuit similar to a water cracker. Off-cuts can be reformed and rolled through the pasta machine again.* Dried herbs (1 tablespoon 
per recipe) are brilliant in this recipe— my favourites 
are rosemary or thyme.
* Once rolled and placed 
on the baking tray, try sprinkling with sea salt flakes or freshly ground black pepper, pressing the seasonings gently into the surface of the uncooked lavosh before baking.
* Broken pieces of lavosh 
can be kept and used in fattoush or panzanella.
* For church-goers looking 
for an unleavened bread for communion, make the lavosh plain, without any seeds, nuts, herbs or seasonings.
