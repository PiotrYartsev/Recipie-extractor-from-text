Liver doesn’t win may popularity contests, but for those of
us who like it, this is a wonderful way to enjoy its deep
ﬂavor and tender but dense texture. The slight mustard
bite of the sauce is a good foil for the liver , and the crispy
shallots are my nod to the more traditional fried onions.
Warning: The shallots make a great snack, so you might
want to make a double batch of them. Do your best to cut
them as evenly as possible so that you don’t have thick and
thin pieces in the same batch, which would cook unevenly .
