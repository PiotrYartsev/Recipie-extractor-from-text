heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a vigorous simmer and
cook, uncovered, until very tender when pierced with a
fork, about 15 minutes. Drain well in a sieve, transfer to a
small bowl, and crush lightly with a fork. Season with salt
and pepper and cover to keep warm.
In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs until well blended. Add
1/2 tsp salt and several good twists of pepper and whisk
again.
In a 9-in/23-cm nonstick or well-seasoned frying pan, melt
the butter over medium-high heat. A fter it foams and the
bubbles start to subside, pour in the eggs. Reduce the heat
to medium and let the eggs sit undisturbed until the edges
start to lighten up as they set, about 30 seconds. W ith a
heat-resistant rubber spatula, lift up an edge and let some
of the liquid egg run underneath. W ork your way around
the pan, lifting the edge and allowing the egg to run
underneath. (This creates nice layers of omelet beneath the
top layer .) Take care that the eggs are not browning. If they
threaten to brown, turn down the heat or work faster .
When the surface of the omelet is almost set, distribute the
potato in a line down the center , fold one side over , and
then fold the other side. Slide the omelet onto a cutting
board and let it sit for a few seconds to settle.
Cut the omelet in half crosswise and transfer to individual
plates. Spoon the green chile sauce over half of the omelet
on each plate, covering the cut end. T op with the cheese,
dividing it evenly , and serve right away .
