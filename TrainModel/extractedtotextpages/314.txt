rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone
baking mats.
In a stand mixer ﬁtted with the whisk attachment, or in a
large bowl with a handheld electric mixer , beat the egg
whites on mediumhigh speed until foamy and thick, about 2
minutes. On low speed, slowly add both sugars and the salt
and continue beating until the whites are dense, glossy , and
hold soft but deﬁnite peaks, another 1 to 2 minutes. Using
a rubber spatula, gently fold in the cardamom, vanilla, and
almonds just until combined.
Using two small spoons, drop little mounds of the meringue
onto the baking sheets, spacing them at least 1 in/2.5 cm
apart. Y ou can make the meringues any size you like, but
smaller meringues bake faster—and they’re prettier .
Bake the meringues until they are dry and crunchy on the
outside and just a touch chewy on the inside, about 3
hours. Let them cool completely on their pans on racks.
(The cooled meringues can be stored in an airtight
container at room temperature for up to 1 week. They will
soften slightly but will still taste good.)
TO MAKE THE P UDDING , in a medium saucepan, combine
the milk, rice, and salt and bring to a boil over mediumhigh
heat. Quickly reduce the heat to maintain a steady simmer ,
then cook the rice, stirring occasionally , until tender , about
20 minutes. The rice will not have absorbed all of the milk.
Remove from the heat.
In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar
until smooth. Slowly pour the hot rice-milk mixture into the
yolk-sugar mixture while stirring constantly to blend. P our
everything back into the saucepan, return to very low heat,
and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon or heat-
