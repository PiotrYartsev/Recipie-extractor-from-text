The Basics: a really useful cookB ook 550* Buy a meat thermometer/probe to help you produce the best cooked steaks and roasts. 
It takes the guesswork out of how long to cook meat by taking a reading of the internal 
temperatures—rare = 35ºC, medium rare = 45ºC, medium = 55ºC, medium well done = 65ºC, and well done = 75ºC. 
* Marinating meat before cooking adds flavour and tenderises. Green papaya and kiwifruit 
both contain an enzyme that tenderises tougher cuts of meat and octopus. Add to the marinade or rub the meat with the fruit no more than 2 hours before it is to be cooked. Any longer than this and the enzymes will break the meat fibres down too much and make it mush. Marinate red meats overnight or for at least 4 hours; pork and chicken benefit from a 4-hour marinate; while fish needs only to marinate for about 20–30 minutes.
* Salads for a barbecue are many and varied. The best tips for any salad are to keep it 
refrigerated until ready to serve and then add the dressing just before it hits the table. Do not add the salad dressing too soon or the acid (vinegar or lemon juice) will begin to wilt the vegetables or lettuce. A few exceptions to this rule are potato, pasta or rice salad.
* When making lettuce-based salads, it is not only important to wash and drain the 
lettuce, but to dry it properly. Any water left on the lettuce leaves only serves to dilute the dressing, which will end up at the bottom of the salad bowl not evenly coating the ingredients. Other than quality barbecue tools and a sharp knife, most professional cooks would agree that a lettuce spinner is vital in all kitchens—available at all kitchenware supply stores.
* Professional cooks have a catchphrase they all work by—Mis en place—which roughly 
translates as pre-preparation. In other words, have everything you need on hand before you start to barbecue—even if you don’t think it will get used. This step saves extra trips to the kitchen—during which time your food may burn. Make good use of the side table attached to the barbecue, fill it with condiments, utensils and paper towel.
* Some foods, like fish with white soft flesh, tomatoes and cevapcici (skinless sausages) can 
fall apart, burn or stick on the grill. To avoid this, brush a piece of foil with oil, add the meat or vegetable, seal into a package, fold at the corners, and cook until done. 
* Pay attention to the temperature of your barbecue. Try and keep the temperature even and 
adjust it for varying outdoor weather conditions.
* Include a good basting brush in your barbecue tool kit. The best one for the job has 
silicon bristles which don’t melt with the high heat, unlike the straw-like bristles of a pastry brush. 
* To lessen the amount of oil you cook in, use an oil spray—either vegetable or olive 
oil—and lightly spray the food, then season and grill; there will be less residual oil on the barbecue potentially causing a flare up.
* Do not be tempted to constantly turn and play with the food. Cook on one side for 2–4 
minutes, turn and cook for half the time on the second side. However, if the meat is rounded and marinated, then turning constantly will give it a ‘spit roast’ effect and it will constantly baste itself; this will also stop the marinade from burning. 
* Keep annoying bugs away while barbequing by burning citronella candles or garden torches. 
They also look beautiful and provide the perfect ambience for backyard dinner parties.
