RED WINE BUTTER SAUCE)
MAKES ABOUT 2/3 CUP/165 ML
I ﬁnd that the red wine in beurre rouge can make the sauce
overly tannic, so I like to blend balsamic vinegar with the
wine to add a touch of sweetness and to round out the
sauce. Although this sauce is just as elegant as beurre
blanc and a lovely partner for meaty ﬁsh such as halibut or
salmon, it’s gutsy enough to drizzle over medallions of beef
or pork, too .
3/4 cup/180 ml fruity (but not oak y) red wine such as P inot
Noir, Syrah, or T empranillo
1 tbsp minced shallot
1 fresh thyme sprig
1/4 cup/60 ml balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup/115 g very cold unsalted butter in one piece, plus 1/2
tbsp if needed
1/2 tsp fr esh lemon juice, plus mor e if needed
Kosher salt and fr eshly gr ound black pepper
In a small saucepan, combine the wine, shallot, and thyme
