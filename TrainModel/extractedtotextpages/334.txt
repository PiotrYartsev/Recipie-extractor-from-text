 
STRAWBERRY-BALSAMIC SAUCE
MAKES 1 1/4 CUPS/300 ML
I am making it my personal mission to get everyone to taste
the incredible ﬂavor of strawberries, brown sugar , and
balsamic vinegar mixed together—preferably with some
sour cream or vanilla ice cream close by—because I think
it’s one of the dessert world’s perfect combinations. Each
element echoes the others and the sweet-sour-savory
dynamic is irresistible. Y our balsamic vinegar should be
decent, but not artisanal, quality . I like Lucini brand, which
is sold in many grocery stores.
Garnish a classic strawberry shortcake with some of this
sauce, serve it with a slice of vanilla sponge cake, or
transform it into a luscious fool with whipped cream and
fresh goat cheese .
