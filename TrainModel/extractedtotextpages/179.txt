Pork tenderloin is one of the easiest meats to prepare and
cook, and its sweet ﬂavor and tender texture are
appreciated by nearly all meat eaters. Choose good-quality
natural pork, not one that’s been “enhanced” with a
ﬂavored brine—I hate the ﬂavor and texture of those.
In this dish, I like the contrast of the slightly earthy , tannic
greens with the mild meat and fruity-tangy-herbal sauce.
You could make this same dish with turkey cutlets in place
of the pork or with Swiss chard instead of spinach. If you
opt for the chard, allow a bit more time for it to cook.
One 14-to 16- oz/400-to 455-g pork tenderloin
Kosher salt and fr eshly gr ound black pepper
2 tbsp olive oil
10 oz/300 g spinach, lar ge stems r emoved, washed well,
with water still clinging to leaves
1/2 cup/120 ml Orange-R osemary Balsamic Butter Sauce
With a very sharp knife, trim away any patches of silver
skin and big pieces of fat from the tenderloin. Cut into
slices 1 in/2.5 cm thick. Flatten each slice lightly with the
heel of your hand. Season both sides of each slice
generously with salt and pepper .
Heat a large frying pan over medium-high, add 1 tbsp of
the oil, and then add the pork. The pork should sizzle as
soon as it touches the pan. If it doesn’t, hold oﬀ for another
minute to let the pan get properly hot. If all of the pork will
not ﬁt in a single layer without crowding, use two pans or
cook it in batches. Sauté the pork until nicely browned on
the ﬁrst side, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and ﬁnish cooking until
browned on the second side and still pink in the center ,
another 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate, tent with
aluminum foil, and let rest while you cook the spinach.
