fraîche (the latter for a tangy note) and often ﬁnish the
sauce with butter . You can use other liquids such as
coconut milk or fruit juice or even a little water would work
for a simple sauce.
There are two ways to make your base caramel: cook dry
sugar for a dry caramel or cook sugar with a little water for
a wet caramel. The latter method gives you a time buﬀer;
the sugar and water form a syrup, and then the water has
to evaporate before the sugar can caramelize, so you have
a bit more time before the sugar begins to brown. When
you make a dry caramel, the sugar around the edges of the
pan will melt and caramelize faster than the sugar at the
center , which means you will need to swirl the pan to blend
what is caramelized and what is not to avoid burning. It’s a
bit tricky , but it’s also faster—and more dramatic! Give it a
try once you are comfortable with making wet caramel.
A good caramel sauce depends on how dark the caramel is.
If you stop cooking the sugar too soon, you will end up with
a light caramel that oﬀers sweetness without depth. It
won’t be much tastier than corn syrup. But cook the sugar
too long and it will go from perfect to dark, burnt, and
bitter in seconds, even fractions of seconds.
I like a hint of bitterness in my caramel, so I try to take it
right up to the edge. Gauging doneness uses both your eyes
and your nose. Y ou will begin to smell “caramel” and then
you will see a tiny suggestion of smoke. F or me, that’s the
exact moment to add the cream or other liquid, so always
have it measured and ready at the stove.
Fortunately , sugar is relatively inexpensive, so if you
overcook it, you can just dump that batch and start over .
You won’t feel the same freedom once you have added the
pricier cream and butter , of course.
