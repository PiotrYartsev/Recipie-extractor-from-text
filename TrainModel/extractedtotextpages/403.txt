milk in a small, heavy saucepan to make a thick paste. As
you stir , press out the lumps of cocoa powder with the back
of the spoon or the spatula.
Put the pan over medium-high heat and slowly whisk in the
remaining milk. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook,
stirring occasionally , until any foam on the top has
disappeared and the sauce is very smooth and glossy , about
2 minutes. Whisk in the butter and salt, then taste and add
a touch more sugar , if you like. Transfer to a medium bowl
and let cool completely at room temperature, stirring often.
In a medium bowl with a handheld electric mixer , whip the
cream on medium speed until it holds ﬁrm peaks. P our
about one-fourth of the chocolate sauce into the whipped
cream and gently fold together with a rubber spatula until
most the sauce of is blended; a few streaks are ﬁne. Repeat
with the rest of the sauce in three batches. When all of the
sauce has been combined with the cream, fold until
completely blended and smooth but still billowy . Serve right
away .
STORAGE  This sauce is best served right away, but it will
be ﬁne if r efrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3
days. The sauce does not fr eeze well.
QUICK CHANGE  Add 1 tbsp brandy or Cognac with the
butter .
