3 egg yolks
2 tbsp all-purpose ﬂour
Pinch of k osher salt
1 cup/240 ml Rich Dark Chocolate Sauce
TO MAKE THE P UFFS , in a small saucepan, combine the
water , butter , and salt and bring to a boil over high heat.
Add the ﬂour all at once, remove the pan from the heat,
and immediately begin stirring with a wooden spoon. Stir
until the ﬂour mixture forms a ball, then return the pan to
very low heat and continue stirring until the dough looks
shiny and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the eggs, one at a
time, mixing in each egg fully before adding the next one.
As each new egg is added, the dough will look slippery and
curdled but will smooth out.
Position one rack in the upper third and a second rack in
the lower third of the oven and heat to 400°F/200°C/gas 6.
Line two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment
paper (this is for easy cleanup; it is okay to bake the puﬀs
directly on the baking sheets, if you like). Using two small
spoons, spoon out 30 small mounds of dough, each one
about the size of an unshelled walnut, spacing them at least
1 in/2.5 cm apart on the prepared pans. Dampen your
ﬁngertips and gently pat any wayward points of dough
down so that the mounds are fairly smooth and domed.
Put the baking sheets in the oven, reduce the temperature
to 375°F/190°C/gas 5, and bake the puﬀs until they have,
well, puﬀed and are a deep golden brown, 18 to 25
minutes. If the puﬀs are baking unevenly , switch the pans
between the racks and rotate them from back to front.
