My Mexican-born friend Gilberto
Martin del Campo, who taught
me how to make the green chile
sauce on page 82, also showed
me how to make these
enchiladas, which is how a lot of
people in Mexico prepare them
and is very unlike the gloppy
“cheese enchiladas” of the typical
Tex-Mex place on this side of the
border . Sometimes Gilberto will
put some queso fresco into the
center of the tortilla before he
folds it, which is a lovely
variation. Make a platter of these enchiladas and serve
them with fresh fruit for a perfect light supper or lunch. Of
course, it will be diﬀicult to ﬁll the platter because the cook
usually wants to eat them right from the frying pan.
This method of frying a sauce-coated tortilla probably
seems unusual, but you’re not frying the tortillas to get
them crisp and golden. The idea is to make them supple,
tasty, and hot. La T ortilla F actory packages “hand made
style corn tortillas,” which are a blend of corn and wheat
and have a lovely springy-tender texture. They’re a good
choice for this dish. Or , if possible, buy locally produced
real handmade corn tortillas. Cotija cheese, named after a
town in the Mexican state of Michoacán, is a slightly dry
and crumbly cow’s milk cheese with a nice tang. It’s
available in many grocery stores, but if you can’t ﬁnd it,
use a dryish feta cheese instead.
