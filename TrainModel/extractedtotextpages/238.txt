Arrange the beans on the grill rack or grill pan, positioning
them perpendicular to the bars so they don’t fall through.
(Yes, I know it’s obvious, but it doesn’t hurt to be
reminded.) Grill, turning frequently , until the beans are
nicely blackened and blistered, 5 to 10 minutes, depending
on the size and age of the beans.
Transfer the beans to a platter and serve right away with
the mayonnaise in a bowl for dipping.
