 
CHUNKY MIXED-BERRY COULIS
MAKES ABOUT 2 CUPS/480 ML
Straining half of the sauce preserves its nice compote
character but helps remove many of the seeds. If you’re
using blackberries, the seeds can be a bit annoying. The
sauce is best made primarily with cane berries—those in
the raspberry and blackberry families—and blueberries.
Too many strawberries can make the sauce wan. Serve the
sauce over a scoop or two of lemon ice cream, swirled with
some fromage blanc, folded into soft whipped cream, or
with creamy rice pudding .
1 lb/455 g mix ed fresh or fr ozen ber ries such as blackber ry,
raspber ry, boysenber ry, blueber ry, and strawber ry, in any

1/4 cup/50 g granulated sugar, plus mor e if needed
2 tbsp water
1 tbsp fr esh lime juice, plus mor e if needed

In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine the berries, sugar ,
and water and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.

juices are running, about 10 minutes for fresh berries and
25 minutes for frozen.
