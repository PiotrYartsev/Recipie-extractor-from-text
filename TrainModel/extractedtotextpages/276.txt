Follow step 6, but because a jus is meant to be thin, you
need to use diﬀerent criteria to evaluate the consistency . It
should have some body so that it is more viscous than
broth. T o achieve this, simmer the liquid to reduce it, which
concentrates the ﬂavor , as well. Y ou also can whisk in a
little butter at the end to impart body without altering the
intensity of the jus.
PAN SAUCE
This is the sauce that you make in the sauté pan after you
have cooked your main ingredient—a ﬁlet mignon, a
chicken breast, some pork medallions. The goal is to
capture the savory cooked-on juices left in the pan, which
you do by deglazing, or dissolving with a liquid. This type of
sauce is sometimes called à la minute (ah la mee NUTE),
meaning instantly , and it is satisfying to make: it’s quick,
you don’t need a second pan, and when it’s well made, it
oﬀers a small amount of intensely ﬂavored sauce that
perfectly accents your main ingredient. And once you get
comfortable with the process, you can have fun
improvising. These are the sauces that make you feel like
an accomplished cook, or as my friend Amy Albert always
said, like a bloody genius.
As with a gravy , a pan sauce can include many other
elements, such as aromatics, ﬂavorful spirits or wines,
broths, and enrichments such as cream, butter , or cheese,
but usually no starch thickener .
The method and ingredients you use to make an à la minute
pan sauce are similar to those for a beurre blanc  or cream
sauce , but the diﬀerence is that you have pan juices, too,
and you are trying to make the sauce quickly , in that pan,
before your main ingredient cools too much.
