Avoid using a hard-crusted bread
here. If you can’t ﬁnd focaccia,
substitute something tender and
ﬂavorful, such as brioche or a
soft Italian loaf . Peppadew
peppers, which originated in
South A frica, are sweet, tangy ,
and only modestly hot. They are
pickled and sold in jars in the deli
section of well-stocked grocery
stores.
