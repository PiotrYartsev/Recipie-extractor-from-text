Traditionally served as a breakfast item, these classic Shanghainese-style pork buns are 
fluffy on the outside and filled with savory pork on the inside. They are a favorite of our 
family for weekend brunch.
2/3 pound ground pork
2 scallions, white and green 
parts, minced
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
1 teaspoon grated peeled 
fresh ginger
1 teaspoon Shaoxing 
rice wine
1 teaspoon sesame oil
Pinch Chinese 
five-spice powder
1/3 cup chicken stock
1 batch Bao Dough 
(page 22)
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon sesame 
seeds, toasted
Make it easier: Mix the 
filling in a stand mixer with a 
paddle attachment on medium 
speed for 1 minute.1. Make the filling: In a large bowl, stir together the 
ground pork, scallions, soy sauce, ginger, rice wine, 
sesame oil, and five-spice powder until combined 
and smooth.
2. Add the chicken stock, 2 tablespoons at a time, and 
stir until mixed in completely. Cover and refrigerator 
while you roll the dough, or up to 1 day.
3. Prepare the dough and shape the baos: Cut 
the dough into 24 equal pieces (see page 24). 
Keep covered.
4. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 
5. Use your fingertips to flatten and stretch one piece 
of dough into a 4-inch circle. Place the circle flat on 
one palm. Spoon 1 heaping tablespoon of filling into 
the center. Gather the edges of the dough together 
and pinch tightly at the top to seal the edges. Place 
the bao, pinched-side up, on the prepared baking 
sheet, leaving about 2 inches between each bao. 
Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.
6. Loosely cover the buns and let rise for 20 to 
30 minutes, or until they feel puffy.
