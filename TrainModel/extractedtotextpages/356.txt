WHAT CAN GO WRONG AND HOW CAN I
FIX IT?
The one thing that can go wrong—but I won’t allow it to—is
that you can seriously burn yourself with caramel. When
the caramel is at its peak temperature, it is more than
350°F/180°C . Plus, the stuﬀ is sticky , so if it splashes onto
your hand, you can’t just ﬂick it oﬀ . Caramel will also burn
if it splashes onto the burner of your stove.
But don’t worry! I don’t want to scare anyone away from
making caramel sauce, and it’s easy to make sure that you
won’t hurt yourself . In fact, I’ve never , ever burned myself
on caramel. Here are three rules to ensure that you don’t
either:
1. Use a saucepan that has at least three times the volume
of the amount of sauce you are making. When you add
your cream or other liquid to the hot caramel, it will
bubble up furiously , so you need a pan with enough
room to accommodate the bubbling without
overﬂowing. F or instance, if your recipe calls for 1
cup/200 grams sugar and 1 cup/240 milliliters heavy
cream, a 2-quart/2-liter saucepan is the minimum size
you should use.
2. Keep little kids, dogs, and cats away from the stove when
you make caramel.
3. Pay attention.
As I mentioned earlier , knowing when to stop cooking your
caramel and add the liquid is key . You’ll only be able to
judge this stage properly if you can easily see the color of
the caramel, so don’t use a dark saucepan (such as
