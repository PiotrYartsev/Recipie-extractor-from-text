 
CHUNKY CHERRY MOSTARDA SAUCE
MAKES 1 1/2 CUPS/360 ML
Mostarda is a wonderful, spicy Italian condiment that’s not
quite a chutney , not quite a pickle, but rather a sweet-hot
chunky preserve of fruits with mustard. It’s often served
with cold boiled or roasted meats. In this simpliﬁed version,
I’m playing the deep sweetness of Bing cherries against
sinus-clearing dry mustard and brown mustard seeds.
The result is a perfect companion for pâté, ham, or even
meat loaf . Or, use it in a riﬀ on the old appetizer classic of
pepper jelly poured over cream cheese by spooning some of
the sauce over cream cheese or fromage blanc. Serve it
with good crackers and a well-made Negroni for an
enjoyable cocktail hour .
