Pour water to a depth of 1 to 2 in/2.5 to 5 cm into a medium
saucepan and place over medium heat. Rest a medium
stainlesssteel bowl in the pan over (not touching) the water .
Put the egg yolks and honey in the bowl and, using a whisk
or a handheld electric mixer on medium-high speed, begin
beating together the yolks and honey . After about 1 minute,
add the reduced tangerine juice, the remaining 1/4 cup
fresh juice, and the salt and continue beating. As the bowl
heats up, the yolks will begin to thicken. Beat vigorously ,
scraping around the bowl with a heat-resistant rubber
spatula from time to time so that bits of yolk don’t get stuck
and overcook. Beat until thick and frothy but not quite
ﬂuﬀy , 8 to 10 minutes by hand or 4 to 5 minutes with the
mixer . It is ready when it forms a thick ribbon as it trails oﬀ
the end of the whisk or beater . Remove the bowl from the
heat and beat for another 30 seconds or so to stabilize the
sauce and let the bowl cool down. Serve right away .
STORAGE  The sabayon is best eaten right af ter you mak e
it, but you can hold the sauce in the double boiler over very
low heat for up to 30 minutes.
QUICK CHANGE
Use orange juice instead of tangerine juice; simmer 2 tbsp
Grand Mar nier or other orange liqueur with the citrus juice.
To serve the sabayon cold, chill it. Whip 1/2 cup/120 ml
heavy cr eam or cr ème fraîche until sof t peaks for m and fold
the cr eam into the chilled sabayon just until combined. Chill
again for a few minutes to set. R efrigerate any lef tovers in
an airtight container for up to 1 day .
