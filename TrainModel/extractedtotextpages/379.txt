SPICED APRICOT and PISTACHIO PARFAIT
with HONEY-ORANGE CARAMEL SAUCE
SERVES 4 TO 6
Here is yet another recipe by my friend and fellow food
writer Matthew Card. It’s a great example of what you can
do with simple ingredients from the pantry . Chances are
you won’t use a full batch of the caramel sauce for this
dessert, but leftovers are great stirred into a smoothie,
drizzled over oatmeal, or used as a sweetener in quick
breads.
The apricots and caramel sauce will be easiest to divide
evenly if at room temperature or even slightly warm. The
ice cream may need to be softened with a spoon to make
ﬁlling the glasses easier . If you don’t have parfait glasses,
feel free to use rocks glasses, juice glasses, or even small
Mason jars.
