STEAMED DUMPLINGS
This chapter includes steamed dumpling classics like Shu Mai (page 50),  
Har Gow (page 55), and Char Siu Bao (page 54), as well as my take 
on popular Nepalese- and Indian-style dumplings such as momos. 
The famous Xiao Long Bao (page 52), also known as soup dump-
lings, requires a bit more effort than other recipes in this chapter, 
but its tasty reward far outweighs the work.
