A Step-by-Step Guide to Doughs and Folds 25256. Flatten a dough ball with your fingertips, then use a rolling pin to roll it into a 
flat, thin disk, about 1/ 4 inch thick.
7. Lift and rotate the disk 20 degrees clockwise. Then, roll the right side of the disk.
8. Keep lifting and rotating the dough as you roll it until the wrapper takes on a 
round shape and expands to 4 inches in diameter. The edges should be thinner 
than the center.
9. Repeat the rolling process with the remaining dough balls and keep the finished 
wrappers loosely covered with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out. 
They can be loosely stacked on top of each other without sticking together.
The first time doing this, I recommend rolling out a few wrappers and then filling 
and folding them right away. The thin wrappers can dry out quickly, so rolling only a 
few at a time and keeping the balls covered with plastic wrap will help keep your wrap-
pers moist and pliable.

Let’s talk about folding the dumplings. The five folding techniques presented here 
represent the most popular dumpling shapes you can easily make at home. Y ou’ll learn 
basic folds like the half-moon, classic shapes like the wonton fold and pleated crescent

traditional soup dumpling fold. Even if you’ve never folded a dumpling, I’ll show you, 
step-by-step, how to get the most authentic and delicious results.
Here are some tips for dumpling folding success:
Keep fi  llings chilled. Use a small bowl of filling when making dumplings and refill it 
from the main bowl in the refrigerator when you run out. Keep your filling chilled as 
much as possible until the dumplings are ready to be cooked. The proteins will also 
keep their shape better when cold.
