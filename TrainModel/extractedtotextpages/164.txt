occasionally with a heat-resistant rubber spatula, until the
liquid is reduced to 3 tbsp, 3 to 5 minutes.
Add the butter and start stirring it around in circles with a
whisk, a fork, a wooden spoon, or anything that lets you
“stab” the hunk of butter so that you can move it around
easily . The butter will start to melt and the mixture will
bubble and boil around the edges. The melted butter
should look creamy , rather than melted and oily . Keep
stirring and blending until almost all of the butter is
incorporated, then remove the pan from the heat as you
work in the last bit.
Remove and discard the rosemary sprig (squeegee the
sauce oﬀ it with your ﬁngers so you don’t lose a drop) and
whisk in 1/4 tsp salt. T aste and adjust the seasoning with
salt if needed. If the sauce is still very sharp, whisk in
another 1/2 tbsp cold butter .
For a perfectly smooth sauce, strain it through a ﬁne-mesh
sieve. If you are okay with the shallot, serve as is. If
possible, serve right away .
STORAGE  To keep the sauce war m, hold it in the saucepan
for a few minutes. F or longer k eeping, transfer it to a bowl
set over a saucepan of hot water (the water should be no
hotter than 110°F/43°C). Y ou can also k eep the sauce in a
thermos for up to 2 hours. The sauce cannot be stor ed in
the refrigerator, as it will separate when r eheated.
QUICK CHANGE  Add 2 tbsp ﬁnely diced r oasted r ed pepper
after adding the butter .
