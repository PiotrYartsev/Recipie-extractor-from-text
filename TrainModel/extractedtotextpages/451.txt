150 g butter, diced and 
softened
1 egg, at room temperaturepinch of sugar1 tablespoon milk
 
* You will need— bowl, food 
processor, weight measures 
and plastic scraper.
* Also known as ‘pâte 
brisée’, shortcrust pastry is often used as a base for pies and quiche.
* This is quite a rich, 
short savoury pastry. Other savoury pastries tend to be made using water and lard instead of eggs, butter and milk.
* Using fresh lard in place 
of the butter will produce a more flaky pastry, try making this alternative called ‘pâte à foncer’— 250 g plain flour, 
2 pinches salt, 125 g lard, 100 ml cold water. Use the same method as for shortcrust pastry.
* Yet another interesting 
alternative is called ‘pâte à pâte’ or hot water pastry— 125 ml water, 100 g 
lard, 250 g flour, 2 pinches of salt. Heat the water and lard to boiling point, remove from the heat and stir in the flour and salt. Cool and refrigerate until required.Method:
1. Place the flour in a bowl, make a well in the centre 
and add the butter, egg and sugar. Begin to mix with one hand and when almost completely combined, add the milk. continue to mix until a smooth dough forms. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 2–3 hours.
2. alternatively, place all of the ingredients in a 
food processor and blitz until a dough is formed. remove and work the dough for a minute to ensure it is smooth. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate.
