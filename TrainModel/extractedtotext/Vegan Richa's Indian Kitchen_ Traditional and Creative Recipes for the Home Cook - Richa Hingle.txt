The 
Vegan Indian 
Kitchen
India is a hugely diverse country, and this is evident in its food 
as well as in its people. If you traveled throughout all of India, 
starting from the northernmost point in the  province of Kashmir 
and slowly descending south, making a pit stop in every major city, 
you would be pleasantly surprised by the variety of food along the 
way. While this book can’t possibly cover every style from the vast 
subcontinent, I’ve tried to be as regionally inclusive as possible in 
my dishes.
Since a large majority of the Indian population is mainly 
 vegetarian, there is no dearth of options for anyone following a 
vegan diet. In addition to the huge collection of Indian recipes that 
are already plant-based, there are plenty of others that can be easily 
altered to be vegan. You’ll /f_i  nd 80 such recipes in the pages that 
follow. In this chapter, however, I’ll cover the staples, spices, and 
pantry items you’ll need to get started, as well as how to best use 
the Instant Pot when cooking Indian food.2 INSTANT POT VEGAN INDIAN COOKBOOKThe Indian Pantry
If you’re new to Indian cooking and the spice aisles at the local Indian or Asian 
grocery store intimidate you, don’t fret: Just begin with the basics. Here’s a list of 
ingredients that you’ll need to make the recipes in this book; they will help you cook 
many delicious Indian meals any time you want. Have these on hand, and you’ll be set 
for success in your kitchen.
SPICES AND HERBS
Here are some of the most commonly used spices and herbs found in an Indian 
pantry. Most of these spices are readily available at major grocery stores and can be 
bought in packs of varying weight. Make sure to store them in a cool, dry place away 
from any direct heat to prevent them from losing /f_l  avor.
Must-Haves
Black peppercorns:  Whole peppercorns are commonly added to slow-simmering 
curries along with other whole spices to infuse them with a blend of aromatic /f_l  avors.
Cinnamon sticks:  Cinnamon sticks are commonly used to /f_l  avor curries, soups, and 
sweets. When added to curries, they give oﬀ   a woody, incense-like aroma. /T_h  ese are 
for /f_l  avoring and should not be bitten into.
Cumin seeds:  Whole cumin seeds are most often added at the beginning of the 
cooking process to hot oil. /T_h  is is called tempering and infuses /f_l  avor.
Green cardamom pods:  Green cardamom has a slightly sweet aroma and taste. 
Although it is a popular spice used to /f_l  avor Indian curries, it is also commonly found 
in Indian desserts. /T_h  e seeds of the cardamom pod are added to spiced Indian tea 
(chai) while it brews.
Ground coriander:  Ground coriander is made by dry roasting whole coriander seeds 
and grinding them /f_i  nely. It pairs wonderfully with ground cumin.
Ground cumin:  Ground cumin adds a soft, smoky /f_l  avor while cooking. It pairs 
 perfectly with ground coriander, and they are often used together.
Ground red chili (cayenne): Red chili powder is made by /f_i  nely grinding dried red 
chiles. At major chain grocery stores, this spice is often called cayenne.3 THE VEGAN INDIAN KITCHEN Ground turmeric:  Although it lacks a spicy /f_l  avor per se, turmeric has always been 
used in Indian cooking for its medicinal and ayurvedic properties. A little goes a long 
way with turmeric, and adding too much of it can give food a slightly bitter taste, so 
be conservative when adding.
Mustard seeds:  /T_h  e black mustard seeds used in Indian cooking diﬀ  er in taste from 
yellow mustard seeds and have a stronger /f_l  avor.
Salt:  Table salt is most commonly used in Indian cooking and should be added 
according to your taste preferences.
Whole cloves:  Cloves impart a robust aroma and a strong, spicy /f_l  avor to a dish. 
/T_h  ey/uni00A0are also one of the main /f_l  avor enhancers in chai.
Nice-to-Haves
/T_h  ese spices are optional, but they are nice to have since they add complexity to dishes 
and great value to your Indian pantry.
Black salt: Black salt, also known as Himalayan rock salt or kala namak, is often 
used in North India as a popular seasoning for fresh-cut fruits and salads.
Curry leaves: Curry leaves are often tempered in oil to soften and release their char-
acteristic /f_l  avor in a dish. If you can’t /f_i  nd fresh, frozen is often available, or you can 
leave them out.
Kasoori methi: Kasoori methi is dried fenugreek leaves that can be found at any 
Indian grocery store. It has a subtle pleasant aroma and gives a unique /f_l  avor when 
added to curries.
S a ff r o n : Derived from the /f_l  ower of the saﬀ  ron crocus, these long red threads are 
used for coloring and seasoning foods. Because saﬀ  ron is one of the most expensive 
spices by weight, only a very small amount is ever used at one time.
Masalas
/T_h  ese spice blends are what make Indian curries distinct from other Asian cuisines. 
Traditionally, these spice blends were freshly ground at home right before use to 
ensure freshness and maximum /f_l  avor while cooking. But nowadays, you can usu-
ally /f_i  nd these spices at any Indian grocery store, as well as in most major chain 
 supermarkets. Common spice blends include:4 INSTANT POT VEGAN INDIAN COOKBOOKAmchur powder:  Also known as dried mango powder, amchur adds a strong tangy 
/f_l  avor while cooking. If you are unable to /f_i  nd it, you can substitute fresh lemon juice 
at the end of the cooking process.
Chaat masala:  A salty-sour spice blend that is usually sprinkled on top of fresh-cut 
fruit or deep-fried snacks like pakoras to give them an extra edge in /f_l  avor.
Garam masala:  A robust powdered blend of spices that includes cinnamon, cloves, 
cumin, peppercorns, and a few others. /T_h  e color and taste in store-bought garam 
masala often varies depending on the kinds of spices and amounts used.
Paanch phoron:  /T_h  is is a Bengali spice blend and adds a nice depth of /f_l  avor when 
used in dal or curry recipes.
Tandoori masala:  /T_h  is spice blend is most popularly used in marinades while making 
grilled tikkas and tandoori dishes.
If you’d like to make your own versions of these common masalas, I include recipes 
in chapter 7 for Garam Masala (page 110), Tandoori Masala (page 111), and Paanch 
Phoron (page 112).
SHOPPING FOR 
YOUR INDIAN PANTRY
When it comes to creating an Indian pantry, keep in mind that a cheaper way 
to shop for most ingredients is to buy them in bulk from your local Indian or 
ethnic grocery store. Although you will /f_i  nd that they are readily available at 
major supermarkets, many of the spices, as well as good-quality basmati 
rice, will end up costing you at least three times more in price. If you don’t 
have access to an Indian grocer, I’ve included some online suggestions in the 
Resources section (page 116) for where to /f_i  nd certain ingredients.5 THE VEGAN INDIAN KITCHEN LENTILS AND OTHER LEGUMES
Lentils play an integral role in an Indian meal. /T_h  ey are usually sold dried in 
 prepackaged bags or boxes, but can also be bought in bulk. When you’re buying lentils 
and beans, it is important to keep in mind how much eﬀ  ort you are actually willing 
to spend in their cooking process. Dried beans like chickpeas and kidney beans taste 
best when they’re soaked overnight and have enough time to soften. While/uni00A0using 
the Instant Pot does speed up the cooking process, if using dried beans, they should 
still be soaked for 2 hours in hot water. Using canned beans and legumes is another 
option, and one that reduces cooking time as well.
/T_h  e following are the lentils and other legumes you’ll see repeatedly used in this 
book’s recipes.
Black-eyed peas: Black-eyed peas are also known as lobia in India and are typically 
used in the dried form, so they will need to be pre-soaked before cooking. However, 
using canned black-eyed peas is a great alternative.
Black lentils: /T_h  ese lentils take a fairly long time to cook, and they are the main 
ingredient in the classic dish Dal Makhani (page 76).
Brown chickpeas:  Also called kala chana, brown chickpeas have a nuttier, earthier 
taste compared to white chickpeas. When the skins are removed and they are split, 
you get chana dal.
Brown masoor lentils: Also called sabut masoor, these lentils are essentially the 
whole version of split red lentils. Unlike red lentils, masoor lentils hold their shape 
better, especially in pressure cookers.
Chana dal:  Chana dal, also known as Bengal gram or split brown chickpeas, tend to 
look like a smaller version of a chickpea cut in half. /T_h  ey are much more robust in /f_l  avor 
than whole chickpeas, however, and are a favorite addition to serve at dinner parties.
Red kidney beans:  Just like chickpeas, these beans, also called rajma, need to be 
pre-soaked. However, using canned kidney beans is a great alternative.
Red lentils:  Red lentils, also called masoor, are commonly used in Indian homes 
since they take the shortest time to cook and require no pre-soaking.
White chickpeas:  Dried white chickpeas cook best when they are soaked for 6 to 
8 hours. When in a pinch, you can soak them in hot water for 1 to 2 hours and 
increase your cook time, or simply use canned versions instead.INSTANT POT VEGAN INDIAN COOKBOOK 6Whole moong lentils:  /T_h  ese look like tiny beans and are green in color.
Yellow lentils:  Yellow lentils, also called toor dal or pigeon peas, are usually the base 
for South Indian specialties like Sambhar (page 20).
Yellow moong lentils:  When you split a whole moong lentil, the small yellow moong 
lentil is what’s inside. Also called moong dal and yellow split mung beans, they are 
used to make Moong Dal Halwa (page 92).
/T_h  e following is a table of Instant Pot cook times for some of the most common 
dried beans and lentils used in Indian cooking. /T_h  ese cook times assume they have 
not been pre-soaked.

Fresh herbs like cilantro and mint are regularly used in Indian cooking as a garnish. 
/T_h  ey also add a pop of color and texture to the dish, along with a fresh /f_l  avor. /T_h  ese 
herbs, along with fresh aromatic ingredients like ginger, garlic, and dried chiles, are 
also commonly blended with various spices to create rich and robust chutneys.
Indian cooking generally calls for fresh herbs to be used as a garnish, and substi-
tuting the fresh herbs with dried versions won’t give you the desired outcome. If you’re 
missing the fresh herbs like cilantro or mint leaves for the garnishing, I’d suggest 
simply leaving them out altogether.
OTHER INGREDIENTS
Other pantry staples widely used in Indian cooking include basmati rice, coconut 
milk, and yogurt. (Using vegan versions of yogurt works just /f_i  ne. More on that on 
page 9.) With the following items readily stocked in your pantry or refrigerator, you 
will be ready to create a wide variety of recipes with what you have on hand.
Basmati rice:  Basmati rice is a /f_l  avorful long-grain Indian rice generally sold in 
large bags of 5 to 10 pounds each, but can also be found in smaller, more economical 
sizes. When cooked properly, each grain remains separate from the others without 
sticking together.
Canned coconut milk:  Canned coconut milk is a great addition to the pantry. It 
helps make rich, creamy curries.
Chickpea ﬂ  our (besan ): Chickpea /f_l  our, commonly called besan in India, is widely 
used in Indian cooking in recipes like kadhi and pakoras.
Chutneys: Chutneys are spicy condiments made of fruits or vegetables that combine 
vinegar, spices, and sugar to complement just about any dish. /T_h  ey are easy to make at 
home. Mint Chutney (page 104), Tomato Chutney (page 103), and Mango Chutney 
(page 102) take just minutes to make.
Semolina:  Semolina, also known as sooji, is basically a form of durum wheat and is 
often used for making Sooji Halwa (page 91).
Spinach: Fresh or frozen spinach is a great staple to have for a variety of recipes, 
including Saag Paneer (page 82), Chana Saag (page 34), and Palak Dal (page 19).INSTANT POT VEGAN INDIAN COOKBOOKTamarind: Tamarind is typically used in South Indian recipes as a souring agent. 
While traditionally the recipes often call for the use of tamarind juice, you can easily 
use store-bought tamarind concentrate as a substitute.
Textured soy protein: While not a traditional Indian staple, if you want to create 
vegan versions of dishes that involve ground meat, like Keema Matar (page 79) and 
Keema Pulao (page 83), having textured soy protein on hand is helpful in giving the 
dish a similar texture and mouthfeel.
Tomatoes, fresh or canned: Fresh tomatoes are preferred when cooking Indian food, 
but canned tomatoes also work well in curry recipes if you don’t have fresh on hand.
Tomato paste : Adding tomato paste into curries intensi/f_i  es the /f_l  avor and adds a 
nice texture.
Instant Pot and 
Indian Cooking
Most Indian cooking does not really require any special equipment. However, a pres-
sure cooker has been an integral part of an Indian kitchen for ages, as it saves time 
and energy. Compared to older pressure cookers, which would hiss every few minutes 
with their loud whistles and risk bursting open when even slightly over/f_i  lled, many 
Indian cooks have opted to use the safer, quieter, and more versatile Instant Pot. From 
lentils to slow-cooked dried beans and curries, an Instant Pot is a great addition to the 
Indian kitchen.
With the Instant Pot you have the option to cook a variety of recipes, including 
curries and vegetable stir-fries, /f_l  avored rice-based meals, and even desserts. /T_h  e 
Instant Pot is great for cooking classic recipes like Chana Masala (page 28) and Rajma 
(page 16), where you don’t necessarily want to pre-soak chickpeas or kidney beans 
overnight. Adjusting the cooking time on the Instant Pot while using these beans in 
their dried form will ensure you get the best possible results in a fraction of the time.
89 THE VEGAN INDIAN KITCHEN Vegan Ingredient Substitutes
Since a large part of the Indian population follows a strict vegetarian diet, dairy 
plays an important role in the cuisine. Many traditional vegetarian recipes call 
for the addition of dairy products such as milk, cream, and paneer. These ingre-
dients, however, can be easily substituted with vegan options today and are just 
as tasty.
Cream:  When trying to substitute cream with a vegan option in a traditional 
Indian recipe, /f_i  nely ground cashew or almond pastes work extremely well. They 
give a similar texture and color to the recipe that is desired from the addition of 
a dairy-based cream. You can also use coconut cream (the solid part at the top 
of the coconut milk can).
Ghee:  Most traditional Indian recipes call for the use of ghee, but these can 
easily be adapted by using various cooking oils instead. Neutral oils such as 
avocado, canola, peanut, and corn oil work well since they can withstand the 
higher temperatures and longer cooking times that are often called for in 
Indian cooking.
Milk:  Coconut milk is most often an excellent substitute for dairy milk in many 
Indian recipes. It imparts a slightly sweet /f_l  avor and won’t curdle, unlike most 
nut-based milks, during the cooking process.
Paneer:  Paneer is widely used as a meat substitute for vegetarians in Indian 
cuisine and can be swapped with tofu for a vegan option. Although tofu does 
have a slightly more pronounced /f_l  avor when compared to paneer, the spices in 
Indian recipes help eliminate it without drastically altering the end result.
Yogurt:  There are tons of high-quality vegan yogurt options readily available 
these days. Options include yogurt from oats, soy, coconut, and even tofu, and 
many of them work extremely well as a substitute in traditional Indian recipes. 
You may have to experiment with diﬀ  erent brands to /f_i  nd what works best for 
you, taste-wise.10 INSTANT POT VEGAN INDIAN COOKBOOKTips for Instant Pot Success
Here are a few tips to ensure success when cooking with the Instant Pot:
• Never /f_i  ll your Instant Pot over the maximum line given. This will prevent 
your food from spilling and causing any accidents.
• Always make sure to deglaze the bottom of the pot if you see that the 
food starts to stick, to avoid scorching the pot and to prevent your food 
from burning. Deglazing involves scraping up the browned bits of food 
using a wooden spoon or other utensil and a splash of water.
• Make sure that there is enough liquid in the pot to cook the food. If 
the food looks a bit too dry, add in some water to prevent the food 
from burning.
• Always make sure to set the valve to the sealing position before setting 
your pressure cook timer.
• When releasing the pressure manually, always keep in mind that steam 
will escape from the pressure valve quite rapidly—so keep your hands 
and face away from the steam valve during release to avoid getting hurt.
• If you live at a high altitude, you’ll have to adjust the cooking times 
because of the diﬀ  erence in atmospheric pressure. A general rule of 
thumb is to increase pressure time by 5 percent for every 1,000 feet 
above 2,000 feet. For instance, if a dish cooks under pressure for 
20 minutes at sea level, then it would cook for 21 minutes at 3,000 feet, 
and 23 minutes at 5,000 feet above sea level.11 THE VEGAN INDIAN KITCHEN Flavor-Building Techniques
/T_h  ere are a few cooking techniques that are mainly pertinent to Indian cooking. 
Although these techniques are traditionally meant for stove-top cooking, they can be 
adapted to the Instant Pot by using the Sauté function at the maximum heat level. 
TOASTING SPICES
Dry roasting whole spices helps bring out their essential oils and intensi/f_i  es their 
/f_l  avors and aromas when added to the food. Make sure to keep stirring the spices 
constantly to keep them from burning.
TADKA
Tadka is the process of heating oil and /f_l  avoring it with spices like whole cumin seeds, 
mustard seeds, and dried chiles. /T_h  is warm oil is then added to cooked dal to give it 
an extra burst of /f_l  avor right before serving.
BHUNAO
/T_h  is is a typical technique in Indian cooking that basically consists of sautéing spices 
with aromatics like onions, ginger, and/or garlic to ensure that the /f_l  avors are well 
penetrated throughout the dish. 
About the Recipes
/T_h  e recipes I’ve selected for this book work extremely well for the Instant Pot. I’ve 
tried to include recipes that are most commonly cooked in Indian homes in addition 
to popular restaurant favorites that represent as many cooking traditions and regions 
of India as possible.
I’ve used a 6-quart Instant Pot for all the recipes, which is the perfect size to cook 
for 4 to 6 people. However, these recipes can be easily adapted to a larger size Instant 
Pot, as well as more people, if desired.12 INSTANT POT VEGAN INDIAN COOKBOOKFor greater meal planning ease, I’ve included the time the Instant Pot takes to 
come under pressure, in addition to prep time and time cooked under pressure. 
Where/uni00A0appropriate, I’ve also included the time it takes to naturally release pressure, 
so/uni00A0you have an accurate idea of how long a dish will take from start to /f_i  nish.
For ease of use and to accommodate possible allergies, the recipes indicate whether 
a recipe is Nut-Free, Gluten-Free, or Soy-Free. /T_h  e Super Fast label notes when a 
recipe takes 30 minutes or less to make, including prep and cook time.
Many recipes also include one of the following tips:
Prep Tip:  /T_h  is involves a shortcut or advice on how to ensure a recipe’s success.
Ingredient Tip:  /T_h  is is for unusual or uncommon ingredients not mentioned in 
 chapter 1. It may also suggest a substitute, even if it’s not an exact substitute for 
the /f_l  avor.
Variation:  /T_h  is involves a simple swap that increases the versatility of the dish and 
gives it a diﬀ  erent /f_l  avor pro/f_i  le.CHANA MASALA , page 2815CHAPTER TWO

1 teaspoon Paanch 
Phoron (page 112)
12 to 15 fresh large 
green chiles (shishito, 
jalapeño, or banana 
peppers), cut into 
/one.numr⁄/two.dnom-inch pieces
1 teaspoon 
amchur powder
1 teaspoon sugar
Salt1. Select Sauté mode, adjust the heat to high, and put 
the oil and paanch phoron in the Instant Pot. 
2. Once the paanch phoron starts to sizzle, add the 
chiles and stir-fry for 5 to 6 minutes, until they begin 
to blister and soften.
3. Mix in the amchur powder and sugar and season 
with salt. Stir-fry for another 1 to 2 minutes, until 
everything is mixed well.
4. Serve as an accompaniment with rice and dal.
INGREDIENT TIP:  When picking green chiles, always 
remember that the larger it is, the less spicy it will be. For 
a milder version of this pickle, jalapeños or banana peppers 
work really well.
