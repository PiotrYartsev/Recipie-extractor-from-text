Text9HOW TO MAKE BENTO: 7 KEY POINTS
Whether 	you	are	already 	packing 	lunches 	or	thinking 	about 	starting	 soon, 	the	idea 	of	making 	
bento 	every 	morning 	can	be	both 	exciting 	and	daunting. 	You	may 	not	know 	where 	to	begin 	or	
realize	 how	easy 	it	can	be	to	make 	bento 	that	you	and	your 	family 	will	enjoy. 	Here 	are	the	7	 Key	
Points 	for	making 	bento 	a	reality, 	including 	important 	safety 	tips, 	what 	food 	to	pack, 	how	to	
select 	bento 	boxes, 	and	putting	 it	all	together.
1. SAFETY FIRST
Bento is usually eaten at room temperature, unless you have access to a microwave or hot food is 
packed in a thermal container. However, from the time you pack the food in the morning to the time it is eaten at school or work, bacteria can grow inside of a bento box. It is very important to pay attention to the following food safety rules to keep everyone safe. 
•	Keep everything clean, including your hands and utensils. Avoid cross contamination by switching utensils when cooking raw meat and packing cooked dishes. Use a dishwasher,  if you can, or hot soapy water to clean bento boxes well after each and every use.
•	All foods must be thoroughly cooked unless they are meant to be eaten raw. No sashimi, runny eggs, or medium-rare steak for bento unless you eat it right away at home.
•	If you are packing leftovers, reheat them in the morning. Heating up leftovers in a toaster or conventional oven or microwave will freshen the food and kill bacteria. 
•	Cool food completely before closing the lid. Imagine steamy rice straight from the rice cooker warming up the temperature inside the box, which could become a breeding ground for bacteria. 
•	Keep hot food hot and cold food cold. Packing a bento box in an insulated bag with an ice pack will help maintain the freshness of cold food; use a thermal container for hot food. You want to avoid the temperatures between 40°F to 140°F (4ºC to 60ºC), known as the “Danger Zone” according to the United States Department of Agriculture. 
•	Try adding natural antibiotics. It’s been said that some foods, such as salt, vinegar, and ginger, help suppress bacteria and prevent bento from spoiling. This is one of the reasons why many bento dishes include vegetable sides that are well-seasoned or marinated in vinegar. Umeboshi (pickled sour plums; page 16) are believed to be the best of all and are often used as a filling for Onigiri (rice balls; page 165) rice balls or a topping for Steamed Rice (page 18). 
2. AIM FOR A BALANCED DIET
One of the main purposes for making bento in the first place is to provide a healthy meal for your family or yourself when outside of the home. So, if you are reading this book, you are more likely health conscious and already seeking a balanced diet; however, you do not need to be super picky or stressed out about adding all the nutrients you need for a day in a bento box. A good rule of thumb for packing a reasonably healthy bento is to include a main dish rich in

about Bento Ingredients on page 17.)
3. PACK WHAT YOU LIKE TO EAT
Although bento originated in Japan, today’s bento ingredients are not limited to Japanese food. In fact, you should pack the kind of food that you and your family like  to eat. If you enjoy Mexican 
food, for example, pack a cut-up quesadilla with salad. If soup is your thing, whip up a quick vegetable soup and pack it in a thermal jar. If you are following a special diet, pack what you can eat. What goes inside the bento box should not be much different from what you would normally eat at home. You can be adventurous and try something new, of course, but try it out for dinner first, just in case you don’t like it and there is no other option for lunch.
4. PLAN AHEAD
You may have seen bentos made by other people and wondered how they can pack so many different dishes in a bento each and every day. The truth is that many bentos we make are with leftovers from the night before. Add a few side dishes made ahead of time or quickly prepared in the morning in the box, and you will have a typical and decent-looking bento. With a little bit of planning the day before or during the weekend, bento-making becomes so much easier and realistic. The majority of our featured recipes are great served as a main dish for dinner. Since the recipes in this book are for 2 servings (except for the Bento at Home chapter, on page 151), it is easy to double or triple the recipes in order to make enough portions for dinner and bento. You will find Plan Ahead snippets throughout this book to help you plan better.
5. CHOOSE THE RIGHT BENTO BOX
While there are many different types of containers that you can use for bento (see Bento Boxes and Accessories on page 12), you should choose the right kind depending on the type of food you pack. For example, a large box with compartments is great for sandwiches and cut-up fruits, while a more compact Japanese-style bento box is easier to fill for a classic bento with rice and a few small dishes. A deeper container is ideal for noodles and rice bowls. We recommend you keep a few boxes of different sizes and depths, and choose depending on the kind of bento you're packing. 
6. PACK ATTRACTIVELY
Assembling a bento box is like plating a dinner. You can certainly pack what’s left from the night before, “as is,” without much thought and call it a bento. However, you don’t need to be a bento artist to make a more attractive bento. Follow the few tips below, and you can pack a bento with ease and make it look appealing. An added bonus is that good-looking bentos tend to be healthier too! 
•	Start packing with larger dishes. We find it easier to start with something that takes up more space, such as rice followed by a main dish and sides. You want to think about which direction to pack, depending on the size of the dish. For example, if the teriyaki fish you are packing as a main dish takes up the whole length of the bento box, pack some rice diagonally on one side and place the fish on the edge of the rice. Fill the other half with a few side dishes.

TWS  Page: 119781631065101_int_13489.indd   11 20/6/18   11:45 AM
Text•	Compartmentalize. You can use the built-in dividers in a bento box or insert baking cups 
(page 12) to easily compartmentalize. Or even better, some healthy edibles, such as green leaf lettuce or shiso leaves, can be used to separate one food from another. 
•	Pack tightly with no space. The difference between a dinner plate and a bento is that a plate sits still on a table while a bento is moved around, sometimes completely upside down in a kid’s backpack. If there is a lot of space left in the box, use small vegetables, such as grape tomatoes, baby carrots, and snap peas, to fill the small gaps.
•	Add contrasting colors. Preparing a colorful bento with contrasting colors makes a bento not only more attractive but also healthier. Carbs and meat tend to be brown and white, so be sure to add a rainbow of colors in a bento by packing a variety of vegetables and fruits. (Read more about Vegetables on page 23.)
7. MAKE IT A ROUTINE
Still too much of a hassle to make bento? Try establishing a routine that works best for you.  
For example, first thing in the morning, open the rice cooker and place the rice in the bento  
box and let it start cooling. Then, place leftovers saved from the night before in a toaster  
or conventional oven to reheat. So far, it has only taken a few minutes. Now you can start brewing your coffee (a must!) and prepare breakfast while working on a couple of quick and easy bento sides. Some side dishes, such as vegetable sticks and salad, are great served for breakfast too! Place everything in a bento box without the lid on and let all the components cool completely while you get ready or enjoy breakfast with your cup of coffee. All you have left to do is to close the lid!

BENTO BOXES AND ACCESSORIES
There 	are	a	large 	variety 	of	containers 	that	you	can	use	for	bento, 	from 	traditional	 bentwood 	boxes, 	
handcrafted 	in	Japan, 	to	simple 	food-storage 	containers. 	Common 	materials 	for	bento 	boxes 	are	
plastic,	stainless 	steel, 	ceramic, 	or	wood. 	There 	is	no	one	perfect 	bento 	box	for	everything;	 in	fact,	
we	tend	to	have	several	 favorite 	containers	 that	we	use	often 	and	switch 	around 	depending 	on	the	
type	of	food	to	be	packed. 	Here 	are	some 	tips	for	selecting 	bento 	boxes 	and	convenient	 accessories 	
that	make 	bento-making 	easier 	and	fun.
BENTO BOXES
FOOD-STORAGE 	CONTAINERS 	
You can use any kind of food-safe containers  
to pack bento, in all sizes, shapes, and 
materials. Large, shallow rectangular boxes are handy for packing sandwiches, while deeper round containers are great for salads, noodles, and rice bowls.  BENTO 	BOXES 	WITH 	DIVIDERS 		
AND/OR 	COMPARTMENTS
When packing a classic bento with a main dish and a few sides, a bento box with a divider or compartments is easier to use. A compartmentalized bento box helps you pack a variety of food besides a main dish, including fruits and vegetables. They are  
also great for portion control.
TIERED	 OR	STACKABLE 	BOXES
Stackable boxes are convenient when  
there are different types of food that you 
don’t want to mix, such as rice and sauce or sandwiches and salad. Some people prefer stackable containers to boxes with compartments because they tend to be smaller in size and can fit in a corner of a  bag or backpack. INSULATED	 THERMAL 	FOOD 	JARS
Insulated food jars keep food warm or cold  
for hours; hence, these are great for packing soups, stews, and yogurt. Since they are sealed well, they are leakproof.
WOODEN 	BOXES
Traditional handcrafted wooden bento boxes 
have gained popularity in recent years, despite the price tag (some can be over $80!). They are not dishwasher or microwave safe, and they are not leakproof. However, bento presented in handcrafted wooden boxes are so pretty, and they say rice packed in an uncoated wooden box becomes better tasting as the natural wood absorbs excess moisture. 
LACQUER 	BOXES 	(JUBAKO )
These boxes are used for bento to be eaten 
at home or served at restaurants. They are typically coated in black and red lacquer, and some have fixed or removable dividers.
DISPOSABLE	 CONTAINERS
Disposable or compostable food containers 
that are used as “to-go” boxes from restaurants can be convenient when you simply want to discard the box after you are done eating. These are great for traveling  
or sharing with others.

BAKING 	CUPS 	AND	 DIVIDERS 	
There are a number of different ways to divide 
and separate food, even in the simplest containers. Silicone or aluminum baking cups or paper cups made especially for bento are essentials to help compartmentalize your bento box. They come in many bright colors and different shapes. Grass-shaped plastic food separators called baran  (often found on 
sushi platters) are also used to add a barrier between dishes that have different flavors.  BENTO 	UTENSILS
Utensils with plastic cases are convenient for carrying clean or used utensils. Some bento boxes have a utensil case built in the lid.
CONDIMENT	 CONTAINERS
Small containers with tight lids are convenient 
for carrying condiments, dipping sauces,  and salad dressing. Just make sure they  are leakproofFOOD 	PICKS
There are many cute food picks available, with characters or charms on one end, which will transform an ordinary lunch into a fun and decorative bento. They are also great for holding food together and making it easy for older children to pick up finger food.
FOOD 	MOLDS
Use egg molds to shape hard-boiled eggs into 
your favorite animal or shape. If you are not good at making Onigiri (rice balls; page 165), you can use a rice ball mold to make evenly shaped onigiri. 
VEGETABLE 	AND	 COOKIE 	CUTTERS
Small, stainless-steel vegetable cutters are 
used to make flower-shaped carrots that you often see in a classic Japanese dish. Cookie cutters are great for cutting sandwiches into fun shapes.
ICE	PACKS
Reusable ice packs are a must-have for 
keeping food fresh and safe.

Text14SIMPLY BENTOJAPANESE PANTRY ESSENTIALS
Although 	Japanese 	cooking	is 	not	as	difficult 	as	some 	may 	think,	you 	should 	have 	a	few 	basic 	
ingredients 	on	hand 	in	your 	pantry	to 	make 	authentic 	Japanese 	dishes. 	We	try	to 	use	ingredients 	
that	are	easily 	accessible, 	but	some 	of	the	them 	may 	not	be	familiar 	to	you. 	Crucial 	items, 	such 	as	
seasonings, 	are	mostly 	readily 	available 	at	many 	local 	supermarkets, 	but	others 	are	found 	only 	at	
Japanese 	and	Asian 	markets 	or	online.	You 	don’t 	need 	to	acquire 	everything 	right 	away. 	Start	with	
the	first 	items 	on	the	list 	and	gradually 	add	more 	items 	as	you	challenge 	yourself 	with 	new 	dishes. 	
SOY	SAUCE
Soy sauce, or shoyu  (/shoh-yu/), a Japanese 
staple seasoning, is a dark-brown liquid made 
from soybeans. It is quite salty, but it has a caramelized aroma and more flavorful taste than mere salt. It gives dishes a distinct flavor and darker color. Widely used commercial soy sauce often includes wheat. If you follow a gluten-free diet, choose gluten-free soy sauce or tamari soy sauce, which doesn’t use any wheat products (or very little). It is available in almost any grocery store.
SAKE
Sake (/sah-kay/) is Japanese rice wine and an essential ingredient for Japanese cooking. When it is used for cooking, it tenderizes meat, cuts odors (such as fish smell), and gives deeper flavor to dishes. It may be found at grocery stores in a liquor aisle or Asian ingredients aisle or at liquor stores. If Japanese markets are available near you, you might be able to find cooking sake ( ryourishu ) 
too. If you have limited alcohol intake, you  
can just omit it.
MIRIN
Mirin (/mee-rin/) is sweet rice wine widely used in Japanese cooking. Mirin is made from steamed mochi  rice and malted rice that are 
fermented with added alcohol. In the process of fermentation, the rice produces a lot of sugar along with alcohol, which turns out very sweet. Mirin gives food sweetness, shine, and a good aroma. It is used like cooking sake, but it has a much sweeter taste, which is perfect for some Japanese dishes. If you have limited alcohol intake, you can substitute mirin with sugar and water (1:3 ratio) or a smaller amount of sweetener, such as honey or agave syrup.
MISO 	PASTE
Miso (/mee-soh/) paste is a paste made from 
fermented soybeans and used to season soups, sauces, and other dishes. It is quite salty but flavorful, and a staple seasoning in Japanese cooking. White miso has a sweeter and milder flavor, while red miso has a saltier and more mature taste. White miso is preferred in the Kyoto region in western Japan, and red is more popular in central Japan. The most popular and versatile type of miso is mixed miso ( awase miso). It falls 
somewhere between white and red miso. Typical miso soup is made with this mixed miso. Some markets carry miso in the Asian food or refrigerated section; otherwise, it can be found at Japanese markets, Asian markets, or online.
RICE	 VINEGAR
Rice vinegar, or su  (/su/), is made from 
fermented rice. Japanese rice vinegar is a 
yellowish clear color, and it has a milder and more neutral flavor than other vinegars. It is

pickled vegetables. Rice vinegar can be found at a lot of supermarkets or you can buy it online.
OILSOils used in Japanese cooking are mostly vegetable oils that have neutral flavors, such as canola or corn oil. Sesame oil has a very strong aroma and flavor and is used sporadically to flavor salads and other dishes. Rayu  is chili pepper–infused sesame oil that 
is often used in sauces for Chinese-style dishes, such as gyoza dumplings. Feel free  
to use any vegetable oil you prefer, as there are many options available today.
KATSUOBUSHI	 (DRIED	 BONITO) 	FLAKES
Bonito is a kind of tuna, and katsuobushi   
(/kah-tsu-oh-bu-shee/) is dried, smoked 
bonito. Katsuobushi are flakes shaved from a piece of dried fish. This is actually called kezuribushi , but it is also known 
as katsuobushi. A lot of readily available katsuobushi is only smoked and dried, but the more traditional katsuobushi is smoked and then ripened with a special kind of mold for months to a couple years. Katsuobushi is usually sold as flakes or shavings in a package, but you can buy a chunk of dried fish and shave it yourself with a katsuobushi plane if you would like to make your own. Katsuobushi has a smoky, savory fragrance and taste that is a great accent for many Japanese dishes. Because dried bonito is packed with a lot of umami (savory taste), it is perfect for making Dashi (fish broth; page 20), which is a crucial component in Japanese cooking. Katsuobushi also can be used by itself, sprinkled on simple vegetables to instantly give a deeper flavor.
KOMBU 	(DRIED	 KELP)
Kombu (/kohm-bu/), or konbu , is dried, 
edible sea kelp that is mainly used to make 
Dashi (fish broth; page 20) in Japanese cooking. It has a subtle yet great savory taste (umami), when it is boiled in water. Kombu should be rehydrated in cool water and then cooked to extract its umami flavor. Kombu Dashi (page 21) is a perfect broth for vegetarians because it is plant-based. When kombu is rehydrated, it grows about three times in size and becomes a soft, tasty ingredient for many dishes, such as nimono  
(simmered dish) and tsukudani (strongly flavored kombu).
DRIED	 SHIITAKE	 MUSHROOMS
Dried shiitake (/shee-tah-kay/) mushrooms are used in many nimono (simmered dish) recipes in Japan. Dried shiitake have a stronger flavor than fresh shiitake mushrooms. They need to be rehydrated in water before use; the flavorful liquid from the rehydration can be used as broth in some recipes.
TOGARASHI
Togarashi (/toh-gah-rah-shee/) are Japanese dried red chile peppers that are similar to peppers found in Mexican cuisine. When the chile pod is used in cooking, the seeds are removed and the pods are thinly sliced. Only a small amount is used to accent dishes. Shichimi togarashi  (also called nanami 
togarashi ) is a spicy powder that is often 
sprinkled on hot noodle soups. Shichimi is a mixture of togarashi powder and other ingredients, such as orange peel, white and black sesame seeds, Japanese pepper (sanshou ), ginger, and green seaweed. 
WASABIWasabi (/wah-sah-bee/) is a kind of Japanese horseradish which is usually grated and used for various Japanese dishes. It is spicy and known because of sushi. It is hard to find fresh wasabi outside of Japan, but it is widely available in a paste form in tubes at most supermarkets. Wasabi can be very hot, but it is more like the power of Western horseradish than chile pepper. It can have a strong effect in your nose.

Text16SIMPLY BENTONORI 	(ROASTED 	SEAWEED)
Roasted seaweed is called sushi nori  (/su-shee 
noh-ree/), or yaki nori  (/yah-kee noh-ree/), in 
Japanese. It is used for rolled sushi. Roasted 
seaweed has a mild but distinctive seafood flavor. It is thin and crisp on its own, but becomes somewhat chewy when it absorbs moisture from rice. Roasted seaweed is seaweed that has been dried and roasted, and then made into a papery form, perfect for holding rice and fillings. Roasted seaweed for making sushi is usually sold in 8-inch (20 cm) squares. The sheet has a front side and a back side; the shiny side is the front side, which should be on the outside of sushi rolls. You may find smaller squares or rectangular seaweed, ajitsuke nori , which is already 
seasoned. This can work well with food using regular rice, such as Onigiri (rice balls; page 165). There is also the convenient, already-shredded kizami nori , which can be used as a 
topping for various rice dishes. 
WAKAME 	(SEAWEED)
Wakame (/wah-kah-meh/) is seaweed that 
is often found in dried form as opposed to seaweed that is fresh and salt preserved. Rehydrate it in water for 10 minutes, and it is ready to use. It expands to ten times the size of the dried pieces. Wakame has a mild flavor and soft texture, and is commonly used in soups and salads.
TONKATSU 	SAUCE
Tonkatsu  (/tohn-kah-tsu/) sauce is a thick 
brown sauce made with Worcestershire 
sauce and used mainly for topping Tonkatsu (deep-fried pork; page 42). It can be used for the base seasoning in other dishes, such as Yakisoba (stir-fried noodles; page 94) and Okonomiyaki (savory cabbage pancake; page 79). Japanese Worcestershire sauce contains more fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes and apples, than its Western counterpart. Tonkatsu sauce has a similar flavor to Japanese Worcestershire sauce, but its texture is thicker.
UMEBOSHI	 (PICKLED 	SOUR 	PLUM)
Umeboshi (/u-meh-boh-shee/) is pickled sour 
plum and has been eaten for over a thousand years in Japan. Ripened plums are marinated with salt and then sun-dried and preserved for a couple months to develop the flavor. Red perilla leaves ( shiso ) are pickled along with 
the plums to give a nice red color. It tastes salty and sour, and goes well with rice. It can be used whole (with or without a pit) to put in Onigiri (rice balls; page 165) as a filling. Umeboshi is said to suppress bacteria, and is often is used in bento lunches for this reason, because the bento may be kept at room temperature for a couple hours. It can also be chopped up and added to sauces or other dishes as a flavoring. 
BENISHOGA	 (PICKLED 	RED	GINGER)
Pickled red ginger, or benishoga (/beh-nee-
shoh-gah/), is ginger pickled in plum vinegar. It is bright red and has a sour flavor with a little gingery spiciness. It is used in various dishes, such as Okonomiyaki (savory cabbage pancake; page 79) and Yakisoba (stir-fried noodles; page 94), and also is a great accompaniment for rice bowl dishes. It is tasty on its own, but it is also a nice garnish for its color. (Note that benishoga is not the same thing as sushi ginger.)
SESAME	 SEEDS
Sesame seeds, or goma —both white and 
black—are often used in Japanese dishes. 
Most of the time, they are toasted to make them more fragrant rather than being used raw. To make the flavor even stronger, seeds are ground in a mortar and pestle or a mill. Sesame seeds are also used to garnish rice and vegetables.

Text17BENTO INGREDIENTS
CARBOHYDRATES 
STEAMED 	RICE
Japanese bento traditionally contains 
steamed rice as its main carbohydrate. Japanese rice is a short-grain rice which is soft and sticky. It is easily picked up in bunches by chopsticks and also can be molded into various shapes. Japanese short-grain rice can be found in the Asian food section of most grocery stores. 
Steamed rice is typically packed on one 
side of a bento box and side dishes on the other side. There is no need to season the rice; however, it is often garnished with furikake  
(seasoning; page 24) or Umeboshi (pickled sour plum; opposite). Onigiri (rice balls; page 165) is a popular rice dish in bento. It is often shaped into a triangle or a cylinder and stuffed with various fillings and wrapped with Nori (roasted seaweed; opposite). It is an easy and convenient food that can be eaten by hand for a quick bite. Sushi rolls are also a frequent pick for bento lunches. It is important to note that the sushi roll filling should not be traditional raw fish like at a restaurant, because the sushi roll in a bento is often kept at room temperature for hours and raw fish would be unsafe; cooked vegetables and eggs are more suitable. You may swap Steamed Brown Rice (page 
19) for Steamed White Rice (page 18) for any of the recipes in this book. Some brands of brown rice might be harder to mold into shapes because it may be less sticky than white rice. You may want to experiment with different kinds of brown rice to find what suits your taste and recipes. 
BREAD
In Japan, sandwiches are a popular lunch option. Japanese sandwich bread is called shoku pan , and the thickness of the bread slices 
varies. Thinner slices (½ inch, or 13 mm, thick) are more suitable for sandwiches. If you cannot find shoku pan, simply substitute with bread of your choice, be it white or wheat, rolls or buns, or whatever your preference. 
NOODLES
Noodles are a great carbohydrate for bento, especially for dishes that require dipping sauce or broth—it is easy to pack any liquid in a separate leakproof container. This way you can enjoy a dish that tastes freshly made instead of a soggy one sitting in a sauce or broth for hours.

Text20SIMPLY BENTOBROTH, SAUCES, AND DIPS
Having some useful broth, sauces, and dips 
in stock in your refrigerator or freezer will save time in the morning, make Japanese cooking much easier, and is a simple way to make your bento consistently delicious. While some sauces are too time consuming or next to impossible to make at home (e.g., soy sauce), some types of broth, sauces, and dips are quite easy to make with simple ingredients. The best part of making them  
at home is that you know exactly what goes into them (no bad stuff!). DASHIThe key flavor of many Japanese dishes comes from umami, a savory or meaty taste that is considered one of the five basic tastes along with sweet, sour, bitter, and salty. Dashi is a flavorful basic broth packed with umami and typically made from Katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes; page 15), Kombu (dried kelp; page 15), or a combination of the two. It is an essential ingredient in Japanese cooking, especially for making soups and simmered vegetables. Packaged instant dashi granules are available and very popular both in and out of Japan, but depending on the brands, they contain unwanted ingredients, such as MSG. Here are some basic homemade dashi variations that can be used for any Japanese recipes that require dashi.

Text22SIMPLY BENTOPROTEINS
Adding one or two dishes high in protein in 
bento will help you and your family maintain their energy levels throughout the afternoon. You can include any type of protein in bento, both animal and plant-based. Chicken, beef, pork, seafood, and eggs are all common ingredients and great for main dishes, as long as they are thoroughly cooked (except in some recipes for Bento at Home on page 151). For vegetarian or vegan options, tofu, beans, nuts, and some vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli, and edamame, are all great choices for plant-based proteins.
FEATURED RECIPE: 
TAMAGOYAKI
 1 In a medium bowl, combine all the ingredients, except 
the oil.
 2	Heat a rectangular tamagoyaki pan or a small nonstick pan over medium-high heat and add the oil. 
 3 Pour a thin layer of egg mixture into the pan, tilting it to cover the bottom of the pan. After the egg has set a little, gently roll it into a log. (Start to roll when the bottom of the egg has set and there is still liquid on top.) With the egg roll at the edge of the pan, pour some more egg mixture to again cover the bottom of the pan. After the new layer has set, roll the log back onto the cooked thin egg and roll to the other end of the pan. 
 4 Repeat, adding egg to the pan and rolling it back and forth, until the egg mixture is used up.

Text23 BENTO INGREDIENTSVEGETABLES
Usually, there are two or three kinds of small 
side dishes besides the main dish and rice in bento. Because the entrée is often meat or fish, a lot of side dishes are vegetable dishes. They don’t all have to be complicated dishes or recipes with many ingredients. One of the sides simply can be an uncooked item, an easy dish that only takes a few minutes to make, or leftovers from another meal. 
COLOR
The kinds of vegetables for bento should be the 
same thing as you eat at home, but keep things colorful. The more color in the vegetables, often the more nutritional value in them. Think about the balance of colors when you build your bento. This rule may help when you make a meal plan for bento. For example, if you have beef for the main entrée (brown), then add Tamagoyaki (rolled eggs, yellow; page opposite), Spinach Ohitashi (salad, green; page 175), and a few cherry tomatoes (red). The vibrant colors will stimulate the appetite when the bento box is opened at lunchtime. You cannot underestimate how the colors of food influence your mood! Colorful foods help make you feel satisfied without weighing you down in the afternoon. Plus, you might get an added boost of happiness knowing someone took the time and thought to make this bento just for you.
THE BALANCE OF FLAVORThe balance of flavor with a main entrée and the vegetable side dishes is important. The flavorings in each vegetable side dish should vary, so they don’t taste the same. For example, if one vegetable dish is vinegary, you may want other dishes to be saltier or sweeter. This way, you are more likely to eat all the vegetables.COOKING METHODIn addition to balancing flavor, you should also try to vary the cooking method for the dishes in your bento. If your main entrée is deep-fried, for example, you may not want other dishes to be deep-fried too. When Chicken Karaage (fried chicken; page 74) is a main dish, you may want to pair it with less greasy side dishes, such as a fresh salad, Pickled Daikon Radish (page 200), and orange segments. Not only are there more vitamins and minerals that can be attained from those vegetables, but also, the fresh taste of salad and pickles will enhance the flavor of the hearty fried chicken. You can also consider the textures of the dishes and vary them. Variety is the spice of life, and it’s true in a good bento too. 
SUBSTITUTES
We used some Asian vegetables throughout the book, which some people may not be familiar with, such as baby bok choy and lotus root. If you are nervous to try a new vegetable or perhaps don’t like those vegetables, you may want to swap Swiss chard for bok choy and potato for lotus root. You can always substitute with other vegetables, so don’t feel as though you have to skip a recipe if you don’t recognize a vegetable. Please improvise with any dish whenever you need or want to, to make things easier for your bento-making. Part of the art and fun of bento is using what you have on hand. You’ll quickly get used to adjusting or substituting ingredients and recipes in ways that work well for your bento and family.

Text24SIMPLY BENTOGARNISH
In Japanese culture, garnishing bento 
with ingredients of various colors is very important, as the garnish will help determine if your bento looks delicious. Color and arrangement play a big role in garnishing bento and can convey different feelings.  
For example, one bento could be very refined with subtle colors, reflecting the current season; another could be playful with bright colors and fun shapes; and yet a third could literally send a message with symbols, letters, or pictures in the garnishing itself.
VEGETABLES 	AND	 FRUITS
One way to add more color in bento without 
much work is using vegetables, such as cherry tomatoes and lettuce leaves. The bright red and green colors can instantly perk up a bento. Tomatoes are nutritious, so you will want to use them anyway. Lettuce not only gives your bento a nice green color, but it naturally works as a divider between dishes so that multiple flavors will not be mixed. Seasonal fruits are another way to add color and also work as  
a healthy dessert after lunch. 
SEASONINGS
Garnishing with flavors and seasonings is also typical in bento. Steamed Rice (page 18) is often used in Japanese bento, and because the rice itself doesn’t have very much taste, it is often sprinkled with furikake (rice seasoning) or Umeboshi (pickled sour plum; page 16). Not only do both of these things season the rice, but they also give a decorative look. Similarly, Sesame Seeds (page 16) and Katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes; page 15) are often used as a finishing touch on some vegetable side dishes. 
SHAPES
Another way of garnishing bento is to make interesting shapes with the food itself. You can carve or use vegetable or cookie cutters (page 13) to cut vegetables or fruits (with leftover pieces from salads and soups). Heart- and star-shaped carrots and cucumbers in a bento will bring more fun to any kid’s lunchtime. Use a food mold (page 13) to shape steamed rice into elegant flowers. Small vegetables or fruit can be skewered onto toothpicks or plastic picks (page 13) for older children and adults, giving another decorative, visual effect. 
NON-EDIBLE	 GARNISH
Non-edible garnish, such as baking cups and 
dividers (page 13), also plays an important part of bento. You know that small plastic leaf or grass sheet that often comes with sushi? There are lots of other shapes and colors to use; they are practical and fun. There are cups with many colors and patterns on the market. You can buy these small knickknacks mainly online, although there are more places that carry bento-related accessories today.

	1 Pound the pork chops with a meat mallet a few times, then make 
small cuts all over the surface with the tip of a sharp knife. Season both sides of the meat with salt and pepper. Coat the meat lightly with the flour, dip in the beaten egg, and dredge in the panko.
	 2	Heat 1 inch (2.5 cm) of oil to 350ºF (180ºC) over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the pork chops and fry until golden brown and the meat floats to the surface, 6 to 8 minutes, turning once or twice. Transfer the meat to a cooling rack for a minute. 
	3		Spread 1 tablespoon (14 g) of the mayo on a slice of bread. Top with ½ cup (35 g) of the cabbage. Place the pork chop on the cabbage and drizzle with 1 tablespoon (15 g) of the tonkatsu sauce. Top with the other slice of bread. Repeat to make a second sandwich. Cut off the crusts if you prefer. Wrap the sandwiches tightly in plastic wrap, then cut them in half.TONKATSU SANDWICH

	1 Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. 
	2		Roll the aburaage with a rolling pin a couple times to flatten  
it. Cut one side of each aburaage, then carefully open to make  
a pouch. 
	3		Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the prepared aburaage 
for 1 minute. Drain well. 
	4		In a large pot, add the 2 cups (475 ml) water, sugar, and  
soy sauce, and bring to a boil. Add the aburaage and cook for  
10 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the aburaage cool completely in the broth.
	5		Wet your hands and sprinkle with salt. Place about ¼ cup (40 g) of cooled sushi rice in one hand, then use two hands to form an oblong rice ball. (Adjust the size to fit in the aburaage pouch.) Repeat to make the 7 remaining rice balls. 
	6		Squeeze the aburaage just a little to remove some of the liquid and stuff the rice balls in the pouches. On the open side of the pouch, place the kinshi tamago threads, flower-shaped carrots, and snow peas. INARI SUSHI

medium heat. Add the ham and onion, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the onion becomes tender. Add the rice and stir-fry, mixing for 1 minute. Season the rice with ¼ teaspoon of the salt and the pepper. Make room in the pan and add the ketchup apart from the rice. Let the ketchup cook by itself for 30 seconds to reduce. Mix the rice and ketchup together, and stir-fry for 1 to  2 minutes. Stir in the frozen peas. Remove from the heat. 
	2		Beat the eggs and the pinch of salt together. Heat ½ teaspoon  of the oil in a small nonstick skillet. Pour half of the egg mixture into the hot pan and make a thin egg crepe. Remove and repeat with the remaining ½ teaspoon oil and egg mixture.

• D on’t overpack. You don’t want to make them feel bad for not finishing the food you made.
• Make it fun (just a little). It takes only a few extra minutes to cut out sandwiches into fun 
shapes or mold hard-boiled eggs.
 
These homemade fruit snacks are healthier than store-bought versions and are naturally sweetened! Silicone candy molds are available in many different shapes.

TextROAST BEEF BENTO
 1 To	make 	the	roast 	beef:  Tie the meat with cotton cooking twine 
to keep a nice log shape. Season the meat liberally with salt and 
pepper, and rub with the garlic. Allow the meat to come to room temperature, 1 to 2 hours before roasting. Preheat the oven to 275ºF (140ºC) at least 30 minutes before roasting.
	2		Heat the oil in a large skillet until very hot. Add the meat and sear the surface on all sides to brown it, 8 to 10 minutes.
	3		Place a meat rack on a baking sheet, and put the seared meat  on the rack. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and roast for 40 to 45 minutes, checking the temperature after 35 minutes. The internal temperature should reach 125 to 130ºF (52 to 55ºC).
	4		Cover the meat with aluminum foil to keep it warm and let sit  for 1 hour.
	5		To	make 	the	wasabi 	cream 	sauce:  Combine all the sauce 
ingredients except for the chopped chives. Set aside.
	6		Slice the roast beef and serve with the wasabi cream sauce topped with the chives.ROAST BEEF WITH WASABI

Just like when you are making a holiday feast, prepare the main dish and side dishes at the 
same time. You will have plenty of time to make the side dishes while preparing the Roast Beef, especially when bringing the meat to room temperature and roasting it. When frying the Fried Potato Balls, the lotus chips can be fried at the same time. Fried foods are always at their best when served hot, so make them just before serving. The Spinach and Arugula Salad should be mixed with the dressing at the last minute also; otherwise, the greens will wilt.

	1 Peel the daikon and cut as thinly as possible lengthwise, then cut 
the slices into very thin strips. Immediately soak the strips in a bowl of cold water for a few minutes to crisp. Drain.
	2		Slice the fish against the grain, about ¹⁄ ³ inch (8 mm) thick. 
	3		Lay the shredded daikon and some shiso leaves on a plate and top with the sliced fish. Serve with soy sauce and wasabi for dipping the fish.ASSORTED SASHIMI

 1 Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC). Bake the bread cubes until  
dry and lightly toasted, 7 to 8 minutes. 
	2		Slice through the thickest part of turkey tenders, butterflying 
them. Cover the meat with plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet to ½ inch (13 mm) thick. Set aside.
	3		Heat a small skillet over medium heat and add the butter. When the butter melts, add the onion and celery, and cook until soft. 
	4		In a large bowl, combine the toasted bread cubes, onion-celery mixture, parsley, thyme, cranberries, egg, chicken broth, and  ¼ to ½ teaspoon of the salt until combined well.
	5		Lay the turkey flat, with a long side toward you, and spread the filling on the meat. (Leftover filling can be baked in its own dish.) From the near end, start rolling the turkey to the other end, as if you were rolling a jelly-roll, tucking the bottom under. Tie with cotton cooking twine to make a nice log shape. Repeat this step with the second turkey tenderloin. 
 6	Coat the meat with plenty of olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place on a baking sheet, transfer to the oven, and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 160ºF (71ºC). Remove the meat from the oven, cover with aluminum foil, and let rest for 20 minutes. Remove the twine and slice.ROLLED TURKEY

Because the turkey breast doesn’t take a long time to cook, the whole meal will be ready in  
90 minutes, which is not bad for a holiday feast. There is not much to do ahead of time because 
you can make all the side dishes while the meat is in the oven. If you would like, you can prep  by toasting the bread cubes and pumpkin seeds and steaming the pumpkin the day before.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
It all started with our website, Japanese Cooking 101, along with posting YouTube videos. If there were no  
fans and viewers for them, then we wouldn’t be here writing this. You are a big part of our motivation and 
have kept us going forward. Thank you, everyone! 
We appreciate Jeannine Dillon and her team from Race Point Publishing for giving us a “small” 
opportunity to publish OUR OWN cookbook! It is almost a miracle, we think, that they found us among hundreds of great cooks out there. Thank you, guys, very much for helping guide us through the process of putting our first book together.
Last but not least, to our families: our moms, who taught us how to show our affection through cooking, 
and our husbands and kids, who became our patient taste testers and endured eating cold bento for dinner for months—we love you all so much! 
(And cheers to ourselves, for being actively there for each other for the last decade. That’s pretty amazing!)
