AcknowledgmentsI have a lot to be grateful for, since 
I was fortunate to be born in the 
right place at the right time to the 
right people. Believe  me when 
I tell you that when your father 
is a lawyer and your mother is a 
guidance counselor, you’ll never 
be short on advice, direction, or 
understanding. Yet it was their 
unconditional love that meant and 
taught me the most.
Writing a book, it turns out, is 
not possible without the support 
and encouragement of friends, 
advisors, and professionals. 
Among the people I have to thank 
for their various contributions and 
assorted assistance along the way are Ann Wijkström, Richard 
Lewis, Missy Chase Lapine, 
Victoria Rowan, Kenny Pena, and 
Linda “Gemma” Thomas. Plus a 
shout-out as well to my agent, 
Sharon Bowers, and editor, Julie 
Ganz, for their work in bringing 
this book to fruition.
Three people merit extra special 
mention. Josephine Rozman 
is my gifted photographer who 
took all of the food photos you 
see within. Not only a pleasure 
to work with, her aesthetic was 
invaluable in making my food 
look as good and appealing as 
it can. Mitchell Goldman, from 
the very beginning, has been instrumental in helping and 
supporting me in every possible 
way, as a producer, muse, 
enforcer, and friend. And my 
brother Laurence, whose many 
talents and profound wisdom 
have always been and continue to 
be indispensable to me.
My deepest love and endless 
appreciation goes to the 
three loves in my life, whom I 
passionately adore—Carolyn, 
Ariana, and Veronica— who 
inspire me and bring me 
happiness every single day.

IntroductionWhoever originated the phrase 
“don’t play with your food” 
had it all wrong. I actually think of 
the kitchen as a place to play.
Long before I graduated 
from cooking school, I was a 
busy advertising executive, 
moonlighting as a standup 
comedian, with a working wife 
and two daughters. I was also 
the designated cook, balancing 
the schedules of an active family 
as well as entertaining our 
friends. That’s when my girls 
named me “Short Order Dad.” 
Over the years my method was 
honed to feed my family and 
friends, and for us all to have a 
good time while doing it.Learning the art of the punch 
line is more valuable than just 
getting laughs; it teaches you to 
edit down to the essentials. In 
Short Order Dad,  I’m sharing the 
simple techniques I’ve collected 
over the years, a basic toolkit, and 
a solid playbook of 100 recipes 
that will help you achieve  the most 
taste with the fewest ingredients  
and the least effor t™. This is 
not just family meals either, nor 
is it all necessarily kid-friendly. 
Rather, it’s about preparing 
delicious food that will satisfy the 
most discerning folks out there, 
whatever the occasion may be.
My mission now is to share 
the joy of making great-tasting meals—and bring the fun to food. 
You’ll find that even though I have 
a fancy cooking degree, I’m not 
a fancy guy. I went to cooking 
school, but you don’t have to. I can 
tell you what you need to know to 
make you a meal master in the 
minimum time.
Good cooking doesn’t have to be 
complicated to be great. In fact, 
it’s just the opposite. So whether 
you’re clueless in the kitchen, 
pan-fry phobic, or already a 
skilled cook, Short Order Dad  
is here to help. All you have to 
remember is this: Life is short. 
Never waste a meal ™.Introduction1Never Waste a Meal™
The evolution of my essential 
philosophy
Gentlemen, I know what it’s like 
to be a guy. I’ve been one my 
whole life. I like it. And I have 
no plans to “transition.” What 
distinguishes me from most men, 
however—men who think nothing 
of having fast-food fries and a 
chocolate shake for lunch—is that 
I am a total “foodie.” That means 
I spend an awful lot of my time 
focused on food, always thinking 
about my next meal, even as I’m 
consuming the current one. I’m 
interested in any type of food, 
from anywhere, whether it’s a 
food truck or a fancy joint, as long 
as it’s great to eat.
The second point that separates 
me from others is that I have had 
a love affair with food ever since I 
was breast-fed. I believe it started 
then. Fresh, local, organic—rules 
I still try to live by.Most kids I know were satisfied by 
a can of SpaghettiOs for lunch. Not 
me. My palate started becoming 
refined very early on. I really 
noticed tastes.
Okay, you might say, most guys 
like to eat. Yet how many guys do 
you know who regularly do the 
cooking? A lot of guys would think 
of this as a burden. For others, 
like me, it’s a pleasure. I’m happy 
to say, though, that change is in 
the air. More than ever before, 
guys are handling the cooking in 
the household. It’s like the 100th 
Monkey Syndrome. (Not that men 
are like monkeys, but a recent New 
York Times  article was actually 
headlined, “Chimpanzees Would 
Cook if Given the Chance, Research 
Says.”) No, this phenomenon 
refers to a sudden leap or tipping 
point that occurs when a critical 
mass of people (or animals) begin 
doing something new. Everyone in 
vastly different locations begin to change behavior. And that seems 
to be what’s happening with men 
in the kitchen. All over the country, 
more guys are actually finding it 
interesting and pleasurable  
to cook.
In fact, all the significant 
memories of my life are 
connected to food. Most people 
vividly recall their first sexual 
experience with rapturous 
nostalgia. Me? I’ll never forget 
my first . . . piece of pizza, which, 
incidentally, was not unlike my 
first sexual experience—very hot 
and over too soon.
Life is short. Never 
waste a meal.
Given the circumstances of my 
upbringing, I’m not entirely sure 
how my passion was ignited. 
They say your connection to food 
starts with your family, but mine CHAPTER ONE
Never Waste a Meal ™Short Order Dad
2must have skipped a generation. 
Neither of my parents was 
particularly adept in the kitchen. 
My father was a lawyer and an 
outstanding man. Unfortunately, 
he had no discernible taste buds; 
he’d be happy eating dog food 
if it was served with sautéed 
onions on it. My mother is a 
force of nature with a master’s 
degree, and was a busy high 
school guidance counselor for 
thirty years, but when it came to 
her culinary skills, let’s just say 
that no one baked a better potato. 
I enjoyed her pre-packaged TV 
dinners (particularly the fried 
chicken) and her other specialty, 
Mrs. Paul’s frozen fish sticks 
with a side of spaghetti that she 
covered with her “tomato sauce” 
made of ketchup and butter. (It 
was good, by the way.)
My grandparents, on the other 
hand, were deeply connected to 
food, and they must be where I 
got the bug. My grandfather was 
a Russian immigrant. One of the 
reasons I loved him was because 
he had a great sense of humor. 
And he fed me. You see, he owned 
his own butcher shop, and every 
Thursday after work he would 
come to our apartment bearing 
gifts: a big box of assorted meats, including chicken, steak, lamb 
chops, and liver. The first thing 
my mother did when he arrived 
was to open the prize package of 
“chop meat,” which was wrapped 
in brown butcher paper. Then 
we each scooped up two fingers 
worth of this raw beef, topped it 
with a sprinkle of salt, and eagerly 
swallowed it down. At two years 
old, I had no idea I was basically 
eating steak tartare, but I knew I 
liked its smooth, rich, deep primal 
flavor—the essence of beef. To 
this day, I consider steak tartare 
and a gin martini my “happy 
meal.”
As a kid, it was exciting for me to 
go to my grandparents’ apartment 
because my grandmother was 
always in the kitchen cooking and 
the smells were intoxicating. She 
was an amazing cook who made 
an unforgettable vegetable soup, 
stuffed cabbage, potato pancakes, 
and gingerbread men (with Red 
Hots for eyes and raisins for a 
smile). I took equal delight in any 
food they had sitting around, like 
the bowl of Wise potato chips or 
the Chunky chocolate candy bars 
on the cocktail table in the living 
room. I loved the combined tastes 
of the crispy, salty chips and the 
creamy, sweet milk chocolate loaded with crunchy peanuts 
and chewy raisins. They were 
ideal together, and it was my first 
experience with “complementary” 
tastes—that coalescence of sweet 
and salty that makes your taste 
buds sing like a soprano.
In my family, every occasion 
revolved around food. This 
included, but was not limited 
to, birth and death. Although 
I wasn’t entirely conscious at 
my own circumcision, there are 
two things I’m sure of. One is 
that it hurt like hell. The other 
is that they served whitefish 
salad. That’s just what my people 
do—clip the tip off a baby’s most 
sensitive body part, and then 
give everyone else some smoked 
fish in celebration. Frankly, given 
the way I was introduced to this 
particular delicacy, my fondness 
for whitefish salad surprises 
me to this day. (You’d think my 
unconscious mind would send 
me running the opposite way.) Yet 
even now, I consider a creamy, 
slightly smoky whitefish salad on 
a fresh, chewy New York bagel to 
be perhaps the best sandwich in 
the world.
I actually remember every meal 
I’ve had—the good, of course, Never Waste a Meal™
3but even the bad. In fact, the 
whole timeline of my life can be 
expressed through the foods I 
ate at every stage. It changed, 
naturally, as the sophistication of 
my palate changed. In camp, there 
was my first peanut butter and 
jelly sandwich. In the Puerto Rican 
rain forest on our very first family 
vacation, we had these amazing 
fried shrimp in the rain forest. 
Growing up, I always looked 
forward to the eggs over easy 
with toast and hash browns at the 
local coffee shop. In junior high 
school, it was those fat, rippled 
French fries at Nathan’s and the 
enormous chocolate chunks in the 
ice cream we had at a local place 
called Itgen’s. As a teen, I’ll never 
forget the absolute exhilaration I 
experienced the first time I tried 
a sausage and pepper hero at a 
street fair. The spaghetti with meat 
sauce and meatball heroes from 
the lunch ladies in high school 
made Wednesdays a particularly 
special day of the week. Then, of 
course, there’s the homemade 
falafel and tahini that my friend 
Alan’s mom made us in tenth 
grade, followed by the disgust that 
always registered on our physics 
teacher’s face when we came to 
seventh period reeking of garlic.Even my boyhood idols were 
connected to food. It’s not that 
I didn’t admire great baseball 
players, movie stars, and world 
leaders, like everyone else. But 
unlike other boys, there was 
no one I followed more closely 
than a guy named Graham Kerr, 
otherwise known as the “Galloping 
Gourmet.” I admit this wasn’t 
common behavior, like watching 
Charlie’s Angels  or CHiPs . There 
I was, ten years old and watching 
his daily TV program where he 
would whip up an elaborate and 
scrumptious French meal in front 
of a live audience. I think what 
drew me to it the most was that he 
had such a blast doing it (perhaps 
aided by the entire bottle of wine 
he managed to polish off before 
each half-hour show was finished). 
Every episode would end with 
Kerr inviting someone from the 
audience to share this marvelous 
meal he had just constructed with 
tremendous humor and panache. 
And each time, he wore that same 
sublime expression of pleasure 
on his face as he tasted his own 
masterpiece. His was a response 
of such supreme, otherworldly 
satisfaction.
Who wouldn’t want to learn to 
cook after that? He made it seem so alluring. So of course the 
desire to feel that way started to 
grow in me, and sooner or later, 
the tree was bound to bear fruit. 
For my parents’ anniversary, I 
decided to surprise them and 
replicate one of his meals. It was 
called crêpe des fruits de la mer , 
more commonly referred to as 
seafood crepes. I served it with a 
fresh, clean cucumber salad. My 
parents recall it being delicious, 
but I’m afraid the white wine 
sauce was way too sophisticated 
for my immature palate.
My parents divorced when I was 
thirteen. I realize that divorce is 
painful for most kids, but for me, 
it actually worked out pretty well, 
in one way at least. The divorce 
prompted my father to move to 
Manhattan, and my brother and I 
got to spend every weekend there 
with him. As I said, my parents 
were part of the generation that 
wasn’t interested in cooking, so 
naturally the man never once 
used the kitchen in his apartment, 
which was so tiny anyway you 
could hardly fit a bicycle in there. 
(Actually, that’s exactly what he 
did store there.) He had no idea 
whatsoever how to cook, so I 
guess it’s lucky he had no interest, 
either. The only alternative was Short Order Dad
4to take us out to eat. Fortunately, 
I was chosen to be the de facto 
designated dining consultant. 
To help me make decisions, he 
handed me Craig Claiborne’s New 
York Times  book of restaurant 
reviews and told me to pick a 
place to go as long as it wasn’t 
what he called a “clip joint,” his 
parlance for “ripoff.”
This was the perfect setup—a 
new place every night—and 
New York is not exactly short 
on great restaurants to choose 
from. This job introduced me 
to a whole new world of tastes, 
some sophisticated, some simple: 
my first chicken scarpariello at 
Forlini’s, sophisticated Chinese 
food at Shun Lee Dynasty, and the 
iconic thin-crust pizzas at the now 
defunct Rocky Lee’s. Psychologists 
might suggest that food was a way 
to ameliorate my emotional pain, 
but I prefer to think of ameliorate 
as “a meal you rate.”
Then I moved on to college in 
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which 
was a culinary wasteland at that 
point with one exception—the 
“Greekers ,” the name for the 
local hot dogs served with yellow 
mustard, chopped onions, melted 
cheese, and some mysterious, but oddly tasty, brown sauce with 
unidentifiable lumps. I would 
always have two, accompanied 
by a bag of BBQ potato chips, all 
washed down with cold Yoo-Hoo 
chocolate drink. It’s the kind of 
meal you can best appreciate 
after you’ve spent an evening 
consuming vast quantities of 
punch spiked with 190-proof 
grain alcohol. I can’t figure out if I 
long for those days or if I’d rather 
never relive a single one.
After college I moved into 
Manhattan and went into the 
advertising business, which 
added immensely to my eating-
out experience. Because I worked 
on big-budget accounts, it was in 
the interest of media companies, 
who wanted to sell our clients 
their TV ad time or space in their 
publications, to entertain us. 
So they took us to lunch almost 
every day, usually at one of New 
York City’s top restaurants. I had 
steak and lobster at the Palm, 
pasta primavera at Il Nido, and 
caviar and blinis at the Russian 
Tea Room. You name it, I ate it. 
For a time I was running four to 
five miles a day just to burn off a 
few calories. Even so, by the end 
of that year, I had gained about 
twenty pounds.My professional adventure as an 
international advertising executive 
had one more advantage: it 
took me around the world, and I 
can tell you firsthand that there 
are fabulous foods to be found 
everywhere. I amassed about 
three million frequent flier miles 
and ate in over three thousand 
restaurants with friends and 
business associates, because one 
of the first things you do in most 
any new locale is bond over food. 
In addition, I learned a lot about 
the differences in cultures and 
their cuisines from the warm and 
impressive people I met and the 
food we shared, which gives me a 
pretty rich perspective to share.
Among the many highlights 
I remember from overeating 
around the globe: just-baked 
empanadas  in Buenos Aires, 
biltong with gin and tonic in the 
African bush, conch fritters in the 
Caribbean, roast chicken in Paris 
that brought tears to my eyes, 
killer moules frites in Belgium, 
steaming and succulent porchetta 
with crackling skin on freshly 
baked bread in Italy, the joyful 
revelation of grilled hearts of palm 
in Brazil, roasted and shredded 
duck in hot homemade tortillas 
in Mexico City with tequila and Never Waste a Meal™
5sangrita, reindeer (yes, reindeer) 
prepared every way imaginable 
in Sweden, sweet stone crabs in 
Miami, and breathtaking barbecue 
oysters in Northern California that 
make me want to move there.
I had always enjoyed cooking, 
but I really wanted to excel at 
it, anticipating that at some 
point I’d want to go into the food 
business. By the time I enrolled in 
a professional cooking program 
at night, I had already been in the 
advertising business for about 
fifteen years. I chose classical French training because of its 
structure and discipline. The 
class met three nights a week 
after work and lasted five to six 
hours a night. We chopped, sliced, 
sautéed, braised, and roasted all 
manner of French food, which 
we would sit down to enjoy at 
the end of the session. I loved 
every second of the learning, 
the training, and of course, 
the tasting. I did my required 
externship at the fledgling Food 
Network, assisting producers in 
preparing the cooking segments 
on the nightly live show hosted by Robin Leach (of Lifestyles of the 
Rich and Famous fame).
But I have to say, that of all my 
food-related experiences, nothing 
is greater or more profoundly 
rewarding than feeding my family 
and friends. These are my favorite 
people in the world and I do my 
best cooking for them. Now my 
mission is to share the joy of 
making great tasting meals with 
you and the people in your life. 
And to bring the fun to food.Short Order Dad
6The Reason More Men Don’t Cook
Cooking for my family has 
turned out to be one of the 
most rewarding and bonding 
experiences of fatherhood, so I 
am surprised at how many men 
still actively avoid the kitchen. 
After all, when it comes to outdoor 
grilling, we men seem to be in 
our element. I mean, what guy 
doesn’t get a thrill out of throwing 
down coals, dousing them with 
lighter fluid, and setting them 
ablaze? Why is that such a rush? 
Is the exhilaration of witnessing 
flames drilled into our DNA? Or is 
it simply that inhaling the sweet 
scent of charring meat takes us 
back to our caveman ancestry?
How is it that while we are 
masters at the grill, we seem to 
be intimidated by the stove? In 
my opinion, these are the reasons 
men can’t stand the heat in the 
kitchen:1. Recipes are like driving 
directions—and we all know 
how guys respond to those. 
We need to understand basic 
concepts first and then work 
out the rest on our own.
2. Men don’t like unfamiliarity. 
In fact, we cannot tolerate 
the state of “not knowing.” 
So, unless you were lucky 
enough to have a mother 
or father who took you into 
the kitchen and taught you 
the way around, these are 
uncharted waters. It’s like 
being lost in the jungle. (See 
reason 1 for why we can’t get 
out of the jungle.)
3. Men are terrified of being 
judged incompetent. Not only 
about cooking; it applies to 
pretty much every aspect 
of life. It’s a fate worse than 
being denied sex (but not as bad as being judged 
incompetent at sex).
4. Fear of failure. Cooking is 
a brand-new endeavor for 
many of us and it’s possible 
that we won’t be any good at 
it. If there’s one thing men 
hate, it’s failure. For me, I’d 
like to be able to do yoga, but I 
feel like the village idiot in one 
of those classes when I can’t 
“bow to the sun.” While others 
stand on their heads with 
grace and ease, I would twist 
and contort like a Bavarian 
pretzel in a pool of my own 
anxious sweat.
5. Bros are often commitment 
phobic. But cooking doesn’t 
take nearly as much time as 
foreplay. Believe me, you can 
whip up an orgasmic omelet 
in the same time it takes to 
toast a frozen waffle.You Can Stand the HeatNever Waste a Meal™
76. And ultimately, there’s the 
anxiety that dares not speak 
its name: fear of the feminine. 
Though a majority of the 
world’s top chefs are still 
men, somehow, dudes still 
associate oven mitts with elbow-length gloves. Frankly, 
it seems far more acceptable 
for women to assume 
masculine roles than it is for 
men to assume the feminine. 
If cooking appeals to you, 
you need to get over the association that it’s women’s 
work. It’s Mario Batali, Gordon 
Ramsey, and Jamie Oliver’s 
work too, and they are 
definitely not women.Short Order Dad
8Cooking is creative.
There are two distinct parts to 
the food experience. One is the 
eating; the other is cooking. 
On the eating side, which is 
generally passive, we often tend 
to grab what’s easily available, 
whether it’s from the can, out of 
the box, or on a menu. But on the 
cooking side, which is active, we 
have the opportunity to deviate, 
elevate, and add excitement to 
our eating experience. And it 
doesn’t take a lot to do—just a 
little know-how and some basic 
principles, which I’ll teach you in 
this book.
Generally, guys open a cookbook 
and what they see is a recipe with 
a list of ingredients; of course, 
this looks complicated right 
away. But it doesn’t have to be 
that way. Ingredients can be your 
friends—if you know how to work 
with them. Whether it’s Indian 
or Italian, savory or sweet, using veggies or meat, the kitchen is a 
studio and food is the palette.
You can take simple, raw 
ingredients, and by mixing them 
together in a certain fashion and 
proportion, and then generally 
applying fire to them—voilà, 
you transform them into a work 
of art. You are limited only by 
your imagination and your own 
willingness to experiment and 
play. Everything you eat that is by 
now totally familiar didn’t exist at 
one point. Someone, somewhere 
had to be the first to ground up 
steak to make hamburgers, slice 
potatoes and fry them in oil to 
make French fries, scramble eggs 
to make an omelet, bake cookies 
with chocolate chips in them, put 
tomato sauce and cheese on top of 
bread and call it pizza. These were 
all acts of creation. Unless you’re 
into the raw food movement—
people buy sprouted brown 
gaba rice and eat it as is—then almost every single thing you 
put in your mouth was at some 
time “created.” Why can’t you be 
a creator, too? Once you learn 
the basics of cooking, you can 
envision greatness everywhere 
you look. Even Elvis Presley, 
famous for his music, was 
inventive enough in the kitchen to 
come up with fried peanut-butter-
and-banana sandwiches. Perhaps 
not to everybody’s taste, but they 
say his friends all loved it.
There are two different kinds of 
cooks: Those who work from a 
cookbook and those who fly by the 
seat of their pants. Many people 
wouldn’t even think of whipping 
up dinner without a cookbook. 
Personally, that’s not who I am. 
I might start with a recipe and 
read it for inspiration, ideas, or 
general concepts, but then I close 
the book, put it away, and go to 
work. However, even if you are 
more comfortable cooking from The Many Benefits of CookingNever Waste a Meal™
9a recipe, you can still improvise 
and adjust the dish. But to do that, 
you have to become familiar with 
certain concepts and techniques. 
If you cook intuitively, as I do, the 
whole experience allows you to 
choose from a realm of foods and 
to combine then in any way you 
want; in other words, to invent. 
Isn’t that the essence of creativity?
Nobody is going to take you out 
back and shoot you if you don’t 
stick to a recipe strictly; what you 
do with one is up to you. As I said, 
though, you need to understand 
some basics first before you can 
be creative and still come up with 
a meal that tastes good. There 
is such a thing as overdoing it. 
For instance, you really wouldn’t 
add mayonnaise to beef stew. 
Ultimately, the flavors have to work 
together. But that’s learnable. My 
advice: start small, play around, 
and feel free to make mistakes. 
Who knows? You might be the 
guy who invents the next Buffalo 
chicken wings, fettuccine Alfredo, 
or Caesar salad. But to create, you 
gotta get into the kitchen and learn 
your way around.
Cooking is rewarding.
Sure, there is a great sense 
of accomplishment in making something out of nothing, like 
turning even the simplest eggs 
into a masterwork of scrambled 
goodness. But aside from the 
accolades you’ll get for your 
brilliant new sandwich concoction, 
it’s the pure pleasure of working 
with ingredients that can be 
exciting. Just handling them 
is delicious. Think about how 
beautiful vibrant yellow and 
fire-engine red peppers are, or 
violet-colored Japanese eggplant, 
or the vivid green of fresh spring 
peas. When you were a child, 
remember the feeling of wet sand 
as you built a sand castle—how 
good it felt? It’s the same with 
mixing up a mound of meat with 
your hands to make meat loaf. 
How about the smell of food: 
fresh bread right out of the oven, 
onions caramelizing slowly in 
melted butter, an apple pie with 
cinnamon being baked? Just close 
your eyes and imagine eating 
your favorite food in the world. 
Food is pretty to look at, sensual 
to touch, intoxicating to smell, and 
naturally, a joy to eat. You’ll find 
that making it isn’t work at all; it’s 
kind of sexy.
Food is fun.
Most guys like to work with their 
hands. Some guys tune cars, and some love to work with wood, 
whereas others like to grow 
plants out of the soil. I enjoy 
cutting, chopping, and slicing 
vegetables and meat. Some guys 
like to paint walls, pitch tents, or 
play guitar; I like to paint sauce 
on ribs, smear roasted garlic on a 
just-grilled baguette, rub savory 
spices into supple meat, sprinkle 
seasoning on crispy, hot potatoes, 
and blend the perfect margarita. 
Some men are excited about 
tools, whether it’s a new buzz saw, 
pitching wedge, or fishing tackle; I 
exult in the latest nonstick pan or 
citrus juicer. Some like the crisp 
crack of a baseball off a bat; I get a 
thrill from the sound of the sizzle 
as meat hits hot oil. Some seek 
the scent of the surf; I savor the 
smell of onions slowly sautéing 
in butter. Some like to shop at 
Home Depot; I’m a kid in a candy 
shop at a restaurant supply store. 
The whole experience of cooking 
is exhilarating. Yes, I think you 
should “play with your food.”
Clearly, food is more to me than 
just a basic necessity of life. 
As I said, I believe in a simple 
philosophy: Never waste a 
meal ™. Whether it’s finding 
a slice of heaven in a slice of 
pizza or experiencing sexual Short Order Dad
10satisfaction from a slab of steak 
or even savoring the simple 
pleasure of a peach or sensing 
bliss from the burnt bits of 
barbecued brisket, “never waste 
a meal” means that three times a 
day, every day, you should revel in 
the food you eat.
Cooking is a bonding experience.
Cooking for others is a gift, but it’s 
especially gratifying when it’s for 
the people you care most about. 
Dads would do anything for their 
kids. Like most fathers, I would do 
anything for mine . . . except make 
one more trip to Disney World. One 
of the things I do for them every 
day is prepare their meals. That’s 
why they’re the ones who named 
me “Short Order Dad.” And when 
they enthusiastically polish off a 
plate of something I’ve made and 
tell me how much they enjoyed it, 
I am as triumphant as if I just won 
the lottery. Lamentably, just not as 
rich. There is no pleasure greater 
than bringing pleasure to those 
you love. I do my best cooking for 
them and it comes effortlessly. 
And that’s because it’s not work—
it’s love.Cooking is good for your sex life.
Food is not just the way to a 
man’s heart, for it works even 
better on a woman’s. Developing 
some cooking chops can make 
your girlfriend, partner, or wife 
very, very happy. She is far 
more likely to appreciate even 
a periodic attempt at preparing 
her a meal than she would your 
taking another trip for fast food or 
nuking up a container of frozen 
beef Stroganoff. It is attractive to 
mothers, especially, when you 
show that you care. They find it 
sexy when you cook for your kids 
too. And you know where that 
leads.
Cooking is healthy.
It lets you manage what goes 
into your body and your kids’. 
How important is it to you 
what your kids eat? You don’t 
need extensive research to tell 
you that most parents want 
their little ones to eat better, 
healthier foods. “Eat your 
vegetables” has been a popular 
refrain since Adam and Eve. 
But serving vegetables to kids today is more complicated for 
a couple of reasons. One is that 
kids seem to have an innate 
aversion to vegetables and other 
healthy foods. They’re just born 
into despising broccoli. (That 
can change: see page 173.) 
Secondly, we live in a fast-food 
culture driven by the cheap 
and the convenient, rather 
than the wholesome and the 
nutritious. So no one should 
be surprised that childhood 
obesity is an issue. There is, 
however, one solution to both of 
these problems: prepare their 
meals yourself. It’s amazing 
what you can do to cauliflower, 
for example, to render it great 
tasting. Plus, you get the extra 
advantage of sitting down 
together with your family for the 
meal. That’s more than just a 
luxury these days; it’s incredibly 
important to their well-being. 
Research shows that kids eat 
healthier when they’re with their 
family. When they’re out with 
their friends, they overeat and 
they consume more crap, which 
only contributes to the wave of 
obesity.11
Never Waste a Meal™I’m a pretty typical guy. I like 
women. I enjoy sports. And 
I’m good at having mindless 
fun. But the difference is I know 
food. Although the number of 
women working and the number 
of men cooking is at a historic 
high, too many still don’t get into 
the game at all, while others 
are only attempting the most 
basic and low-level tasks, like 
boiling something in a plastic 
bag that looks like wet garbage 
or microwaving a TV dinner. 
That’s where this book comes in. 
You don’t have to become a great 
chef (although you probably 
could). And you certainly 
don’t have to be perfect; that’s 
Martha Stewart’s job. My hope 
is to provide you with a level 
of competence to create your 
own culinary successes so 
that you’re able to experience 
firsthand the satisfaction of 
serving good eats to the people 
you love.I’ll offer basic instructions and 
simple recipes. I’ll show you 
how to get the most flavor with 
the least effort and the fewest 
ingredients. That’s especially 
important to us guys because 
we don’t like things fussy or 
froufrou. (Frankly, I don’t even 
know what froufrou  means, or if 
I’ve even spelled it correctly. It just 
sounds girly.) The point is that my 
approach is to keep things basic 
and simple, yet still make it good.
My job is to offer encouragement, 
particularly to those who don’t 
know what they’re missing by not 
preparing the occasional meal. (At 
the very least, when you cook, you 
earn the right to have someone 
else clean up your mess.) I believe 
the kitchen is your playroom and 
you have complete permission to 
play in it. Sometimes you’ll screw 
up, like we all do. In fact, you need 
to. First of all, you can’t really 
learn if you don’t make mistakes. Second, that’s where half of the 
fun comes in. Even if you can’t 
recover when it seems like all is 
lost, it’s okay to give up on this 
round and order pizza. Your effort 
will still be appreciated. And 
there’s no such thing as bad pizza.
Unless you’re being 
paid to cook, don’t 
be afraid to make 
mistakes.
I’ll also show you the tools of 
trade. Guys love tools, whether 
they’re from the hardware store 
or the sports store. (Chances are 
that whenever you see someone 
wearing a tool belt, nine times out 
of ten, it’s a guy. Women generally 
wear much better looking belts.) 
Some guys are handy with the 
tools of plumbing, gardening, and 
painting. Others can tune their 
own car or piano. But for some 
reason, men see the tools of the Making the Kitchen a PlayroomShort Order Dad
12kitchen as a completely different 
animal, not really masculine. 
But why should that be? A tool 
is a tool. Think of it this way: 
you’re already using some of the 
fundamental tools of the sport 
(and some techniques too) for the 
barbecue grill as you will indoors. 
So it’s not that much of a stretch 
to bring your game inside and familiarize yourself with the tools 
of the kitchen.
And while you’re at it, if you’re 
going to make the kitchen a 
playroom, bring the tunes. 
Whether Beethoven or Beastie 
Boys, the “Boss” or the Beatles, 
Ed Sheeran or EDM is your thing, 
get a sound track going while you cook. Make music a part of 
making dinner . . . and chop to the 
beat.
“Food is music to the 
body, music is food to 
the heart.”

How to Build a PantryYou don’t literally have to build a 
pantry. This is a cooking book, 
not a primer on carpentry. And 
doesn’t pantry  seem like such a 
wussy word anyway? How about 
cabinet  or cupboard , or even a 
closet for foodstuff . The idea, in 
any case, is that there are certain 
items you should keep on hand so 
you can always throw something 
together that’s appetizing to eat.
You’re going to want to have 
foods that are packaged in cans, 
boxes, and containers for a long 
shelf life. The ideal list should 
be composed of ingredients that 
immediately add flavor impact 
to anything else you might have 
lying around, so that’s where 
various condiments and sauces 
come in handy. You’ll also want 
to include foods that can be 
transformed directly into a meal, 
like pasta, even when nothing 
else is available in your home. 
And although it’s not technically your pantry, there are a number of 
suggestions here for what to keep 
in the refrigerator as well.
• Condiments: soy sauce, hot 
sauce (try sriracha, and Korean 
chile paste gochujang  is cool 
too), mustard (Dijon would be 
good), ketchup, Worcestershire 
sauce
• Oils:  good olive is 
indispensable for dressing 
and drizzling, peanut is good 
for cooking, as are “neutral” 
oils (like canola, grapeseed, or 
safflower), whose absence of 
flavor and higher “smoke point” 
is their advantage (i.e., they 
perform well over higher heat)
• Sweet and sour: vinegar, 
honey, maple syrup, jam, or 
jelly. Nutella, because Nutella. 
Chocolate chips (not necessarily 
to cook with, but to pop into 
your mouth occasionally)
• Cans:  tomatoes (whole, 
peeled, or chopped; Italian San Marzanos are lovely, if available), 
beans, tuna fish, tomato paste
• Boxes:  Pasta, rice, stock 
(chicken, vegetable, and/or 
beef), kosher and/or high-
quality (Maldon) sea salt!
• Other: olives, capers, nuts, 
peanut butter, raisins, bread 
crumbs, aromatics (such as 
onions, garlic, and carrots, 
which last pretty long), and 
potatoes are always good to 
have around
• Refrigerator:  eggs, cheese 
(such as Parmesan and 
cheddar), bacon, butter, 
tortillas, and lemons!!!
• Freezer: peas, spinach, breads, 
bagged fruits (for smoothies), 
pizza (for when you mess up)
• Dried herbs: such as oregano, 
thyme, rosemary, tarragon
• Dried spices: such as 
cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin, 
paprika, chili powder, curry 
powder, cayenne, peppercorns, 
red pepper flakesCHAPTER TWO
How to Build a PantryShort Order Dad
14Here’s the thing: you don’t 
go into any new endeavor 
without first having to learn some 
of the basics. I don’t know much 
of anything about hang gliding, but 
you can bet I wouldn’t be giving 
it a whirl unless I first had some 
idea of what I was doing and how 
to do it. Exhilaration aside, I have 
very little interest in free-falling 
through midair before smashing 
face-first into a mountainside. 
It’s somewhat the same when it 
comes to cooking, albeit much 
less dangerous. The point is that 
there are a few simple ideas you 
want to understand before you 
proceed.
Before we dive into the essential 
techniques, there’s one 
fundamental rule that I strongly 
believe and follow. In fact, if I 
have a mantra in cooking, it’s 
this: get the best ingredients 
you can . And don’t screw ’em 
up too much . Nothing has more impact of the taste on your food 
than the quality of the ingredients 
you put into it. And, the better 
the ingredients you start with, 
the less you need and want to do 
with them. For example, there 
are many ways I will show you to 
prepare delicious meat and fish, 
but it’s true that an outstanding 
piece of steak requires nothing 
more than fire and a little salt to 
be mouthwatering, and a piece of 
raw tuna, snapper, or yellowtail 
with a dip into soy sauce alone 
can be ethereal.
“Get the best 
ingredients you can. 
And don’t screw ’em 
up too much.”
In almost everything we eat—
indeed, in every aspect of life—
there is a range that runs from 
poor to extraordinary. Just as 
there is standout steak and sushi, so too are there disappointments. 
And what makes one relatively 
simple dish vastly superior to 
another is what was used to make 
it and how it was made. We can 
practice the making part, and even 
get really good at it. But as far as 
the ingredient part—get the best 
you can. Sometimes best might 
mean the freshest; other times 
it might be the more expensive. 
Most of the time, though, it simply 
means knowing what to look for 
when you go shopping.
Choosing Ingredients
There are some cases where 
particular ingredients will make 
little difference to the final 
product. For example, there are 
numerous brands of expensive 
butters now available on the 
market. Some are imported. 
Some have a higher percentage 
of fat, which is purported to make 
a higher quality butter. Feel free 
to sample fancy butters and When Picky is Good:  
Ingredient Shopping15
How to Build a Pantrysee if you discover a discernible 
difference yourself. However, 
in general, your cooking is 
going to be perfectly fine with 
normal, everyday butter. (Land 
O’Lakes Unsalted Sweet Butter 
is considered the standard 
among most cooks.) The only 
advice I’d give here is to buy the 
unsalted variety because salt 
is an extremely important taste 
component, so it is essential that 
you control the amount of it in 
your cooking.
Olive oils, on the other hand, 
can make a significant difference 
to the end product. Extra-virgin 
olive oils do cost more than 
regular olive oil, but they are 
worth it because they taste better. 
And when you are making a 
dish with few ingredients, each 
ingredient stands out more, so 
you’re going to want to work with 
the good stuff. Fresh tomatoes 
and mozzarella that are topped 
with nothing more than salt and 
olive oil call for the best tasting 
olive you can afford. It can either 
elevate the dish, or render it 
dreary. There is no one “best,” 
so the only way to determine 
quality levels is to taste and 
compare. Most grocery stores 
now stock a pretty good variety, and often specialty food stores 
provide a little sampling station 
for tasting. There are terrific olive 
oils available here from all over 
the world, especially from the 
Mediterranean, Italy, Spain, and 
France. From the supermarket, 
I like the Monini and Columela 
brands.
What’s an Extra Virgin? The 
difference between extra-virgin 
olive oil and regular old olive oil 
is that extra-virgin is obtained 
from the first pressing of the 
olives. (You’ll often see the words 
First Cold Pressed  on the bottle 
label.) As a result, it has a more 
pronounced, pungent flavor than 
ordinary olive oil does. Does that 
make a difference? And is it worth 
the price premium? The short 
answer is yes. And when the olive 
oil is a central component of a 
dish or a sauce, you should use 
the best you can. When you’re 
making spaghetti with nothing 
more than oil and garlic, for 
example. Same thing when you’re 
dipping a crusty piece of baguette 
into a little bowl of it.
Vinegars: The chances are that 
you’re using the same vinegar 
over and over. I know people 
who pour balsamic vinegar on top everything they eat. You 
need to know that there is a 
mesmerizing variety of vinegars 
out there. For example, there’s 
the nutty-tasting sherry wine 
vinegar, champagne wine vinegar, 
apple cider vinegar, rice wine 
vinegar, and vinegars flavored 
with herbs. In the category 
of “you get what you pay for,” 
there is aged balsamic vinegar, 
which can run you upward of a 
hundred bucks a bottle, but whose 
sweetness and syrupy texture is 
incomparable on top of freshly 
sliced strawberries or a chunk of 
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for 
example. The point is, go explore 
and taste different vinegars if 
you can, because each has its 
own characteristics that can have 
a profound impact on the dish 
you’re making.
Fruits and vegetables are 
almost always preferable to 
purchase fresh rather than the 
canned and frozen products. 
They taste better. Their texture 
is better. And they haven’t been 
altered in any way—as they might 
when canned or frozen—which 
makes them more nutritious, too. 
Peaches in a can are mighty tasty 
(generally because they’re stored 
in sweet syrup), but if you’ve Short Order Dad
16ever had a peach at its peak 
of ripeness in midsummer, its 
heavenly juice dripping from your 
chin, you know what I’m talking 
about here. Go fresh whenever 
you can; it will make your meals 
better.
Of course there are some 
exceptions, too: frozen peas 
are terrific, frozen fruit is ideal 
for kids’ smoothies and dads’ 
daiquiris, and I use canned beans 
often in my kitchen. And most 
chefs agree that canned tomatoes, 
especially from the San Marzano 
region of Italy, make a sauce as 
good, or sometimes better, than 
fresh ones. But whenever you can, 
get your fruit and veggies fresh, 
in their natural state, and as close 
to the source as you can. Fresh 
produce, in season, continues to 
be a revelation. Just-picked corn 
on the cob is so sweet you can 
enjoy it raw. As are fresh berries, 
pineapple, asparagus, cherries, 
greens, basil, and so many others.
Potatoes: There are many types 
of potatoes, but for cooking 
purposes, all you generally need 
to know is that they fall into 
two categories—starchy and 
waxy—and that some varieties 
work better for certain dishes than others. The starchy ones 
(like Idaho/Russet) are ideal for 
baking because they get light and 
kind of fluffy when cooked. They 
also make good fries. The thinner, 
smoother-skinned “waxy” kind 
of potato, often red, yellow, and 
round, are good for boiling and 
steaming and ideal for soups 
and dishes like potato salad 
because they hold their shape 
well. For mashed potatoes, I 
like Yukon Gold for their creamy 
taste and texture. To bake, I’ll 
take Idaho. I like the way they 
can be simultaneously soft on the 
inside, yet crisp on the outside. 
Fingerling potatoes are kind of 
smallish, which means they don’t 
take as long to cook, so they come 
out very well in a sauté or roasted 
with olive oil. Potatoes also come 
in a rainbow of colors, like purple, 
which makes for some very pretty 
food.
Beef: The US Government 
grades steak, so clearly there 
are varying levels of quality that 
are determined by flavor and 
texture. USDA Prime is the best 
(only about 2–3 percent of all beef 
achieves this superior rating); 
USDA Choice comes next (most 
of the higher quality grocery 
stores carry this); and then comes USDA Select (which is generally 
found everywhere else). Some 
steaks are aged for many days 
to improve their tenderness and 
intensify their flavor. The good 
news is that steak does not have 
to be prohibitively expensive to 
taste wonderful. In fact, some of 
the most flavorful cuts can also 
be the least expensive, like a 
skirt steak or short ribs. But you 
need to know how to best prepare 
those to coax out the most flavor 
possible, which we will cover in 
the chapter on techniques.
Poultry: I’m no fan of the popular 
supermarket brands of chicken. 
I find them bland and rubbery. 
And if you’ve seen the alarming 
documentary  Food, Inc. , you 
might not want to eat mass-
produced chicken ever again. 
However, if you can get your 
hands on a kosher, organic, or 
free-range bird, they’re generally 
better. You can instantly taste the 
difference.
As for turkey, I’ve had perfectly 
fine results with the good old 
frozen kind. Kosher turkeys 
have already been brined (which 
means soaked in a saltwater 
solution), so they come with 
built-in flavor. I think duck is totally 17
How to Build a Pantryunderappreciated and underused 
by the home cook, but I am a great 
fan of it, particularly cooking the 
breast. Most duck breasts are 
sold frozen, and if you buy them 
that way, make sure what you’re 
buying is boneless with skin, and 
raw, not smoked or precooked. 
Again, I prefer fresh, in which 
case you’ll be looking for a Pekin, 
Moulard, or Muscovy duck breast.
Fish and seafood: Fresh. 
Fresh. Fresh. Few things are as 
unappealing, even disgusting, 
to eat when they aren’t fresh. 
The best idea is to get it from a 
fishmonger in a fish or seafood 
store, or to buy it from a market 
with very high turnover that 
receives their deliveries daily. 
In fact, don’t be afraid to ask 
someone in charge when the 
fish you’re planning to buy was 
delivered. One of the best ways 
to tell if fish is fresh is—are you 
ready for this?—when it doesn’t 
smell like fish. That’s right. Fresh 
fish should be free of smell, or 
perhaps have a mild ocean-like 
odor. Use your nose. If it doesn’t 
smell good, it won’t improve with 
cooking and it won’t taste good.
Although the advantage to 
buying fish whole is getting freshness and taste at the 
best price, it is much easier to 
cook boneless fillets or whole 
pieces of fish called “steaks.” If 
you do buy whole fish, look for 
bright, clear eyes—neither dull 
or hazy—and skin that’s moist 
and shiny, with firm flesh. When 
purchasing fillets and steaks, 
look for moist flesh and skin 
that is shiny and resilient. If the 
color is dull or browning, don’t 
buy it.
Cheese: One could write an entire 
book on cheese, but that won’t be 
me. It is far too large a category 
to comment on in detail, yet there 
are some basic principles to 
know. There are hundreds of types 
of cheeses, which are generally 
categorized as follows:
• Fresh: Smooth, creamy, and 
mild tasting, like ricotta, feta, 
mozzarella, cottage, and cream 
cheese.
• Soft: Camembert, Brie, goat 
cheese.
• Semisoft: These have a rind 
and range in taste from sweet 
and buttery (Edam, Pont 
l’Évêque) to more aromatic 
(Epoisses).
• Semi-hard:  Provolone, Gouda, 
and Jarlsberg are examples.• Hard:  Cheddar, Parmigiano-
Reggiano, Gruyère, and 
Manchego are some of the best 
known.
• Blue: These cheeses (Stilton, 
Roquefort, Gorgonzola, and 
Maytag Blue) have blue “veins” 
running through them, which 
gives them a sharp, salty (and 
acquired) taste.
The more that the cheese is the 
star of a dish, as opposed to 
a supporting player, the more 
you’ll probably want to invest in 
the best version of that cheese 
you can. For example, pizza with 
basic grocery store mozzarella 
is fine, but is improved by 
freshly made mozzarella. Grilled 
cheese sandwiches with slices 
of American will do, but can be 
upgraded significantly by choosing 
a cheese with character.
Unless you’re feeling lazy and 
cash-rich, grate your own. The 
grated Parmesan that comes 
in a cardboard container will 
never match the flavor you get 
from freshly grated Parmigiano-
Reggiano. Although Parmigiano-
Reggiano is a more expensive 
investment, you don’t have to 
use as much of it because it has 
a rich full, flavor. Other than for Short Order Dad
18pure convenience, it doesn’t 
make sense to buy already 
grated cheese for which you pay 
a premium when it is quite easy 
to grate yourself, and it will be 
fresher, too.
Different cheeses, naturally, serve 
different purposes. Cheddar, 
Swiss, Muenster, provolone, 
jack, and mozzarella are all good 
choices when you need cheese 
that melts well. As is good old 
processed American. For grating, 
hard cheeses like Parmesan, 
Pecorino, and Grana are ideal. For 
straight up enjoying with a glass 
of wine, I’m always happy with a 
chunk of Gruyère or Parmigiano-
Reggiano, known as the “King of 
Cheeses.”
Wine for cooking: Here’s the 
rule: don’t cook with any wine 
you wouldn’t drink. That means 
never buy “cooking wine” in the 
supermarket. Wine adds flavor 
and depth to many a dish. Most 
of the alcohol itself evaporates 
and what’s left behind is the 
concentrated character of the 
grape. That could be sweetness, 
richness, tartness, earthiness, 
or fruitiness, depending on the 
wine, the rest of the ingredients, 
and when in the cooking process it is added. When you’re using 
it as the cooking medium or 
vessel, like pears poached in 
red wine or mussels steamed in 
white wine, wine goes in at the 
beginning. When it’s being used 
to “deglaze” or make a sauce, 
wine goes in at the end. But 
whether it’s a traditional boeuf 
Bourguignon  (beef braised in red 
wine), classic coq au vin (chicken 
cooked in wine), or just a splash 
of vino in your tomato sauce, wine 
adds a dimension of flavor and 
sophistication like nothing else.
Although I wouldn’t go so far as 
to suggest you buy an expensive 
bottle of wine to cook with, do 
purchase a wine that you would 
gladly serve with the meal. In fact, 
it is not unusual to use the same 
wine in cooking that you will be 
drinking. For example, I steam 
clams in Pinot Gris while my 
guest and I are enjoying a glass of 
the same.
Pasta: Nowhere in this book will 
I instruct you in how to make 
your own fresh pasta. (Perhaps 
I will show you in the next book, 
when you’ll be ready.) That’s 
because of what I call the effort to 
enjoyment ratio.  Specifically, that 
refers to the relationship between the amount of time and effort it 
takes to make something and the 
pleasure it yields. So in the case 
of making your own fresh pasta 
noodles, the degree of effort and 
time necessary to get it done well 
(coupled with your investment in a 
pasta making machine that you’re 
not likely to use all that often) will 
not deliver sufficiently more value 
than buying a box of pasta from 
the supermarket shelf. To be clear, 
fresh pasta is fantastic to eat due 
to its silky, supple, and luxurious 
mouthfeel. But you can order it in 
a restaurant or purchase some 
directly from a store that makes it 
fresh rather than attempt to make 
your own. For the most part, you’ll 
do very well with standard boxed 
pasta, particularly if all you plan 
to do is dump a bottle of premade 
marinara over your noodles. (But 
don’t do that; I’ll show you how to 
make your own on page 149.) As 
for the stuff that comes in the box, 
as far as I can tell, it’s all pretty 
much the same. Barilla, Ronzoni, 
and DeCecco all make good 
products.
Be aware that different shapes 
of pasta—long, short, thick, thin, 
ridged, smooth, curved, and with 
crevices—should be matched 
with certain sauces to obtain 19
How to Build a Pantrymaximum results. There is a 
reason you always see linguini 
with clam sauce on a menu. 
It’s that the right shape blends 
harmoniously with its sauce, the 
wrong one leaves something to 
be desired. The more delicate 
fresh pasta goes best with more 
subtle sauces, whether they’re 
made with vegetables, seafood, 
or meat, which are often butter-
based and enriched with cream. 
Dry, boxed pasta is more hearty 
and substantial, so it can better 
handle the bolder, thicker, and 
chunkier sauces. For example, 
penne works well for a simple 
tomato sauce, and rigatoni would 
be ideal with meat sauce. The 
long, thin pasta, such as spaghetti 
or capellini, pairs well with olive 
oil based sauces. The thicker 
fettuccine and tagliatelle stand up 
nicely to cream sauces, as does 
the corkscrew shaped fusilli. Just 
remember that there should be 
harmony between your pasta and your sauce. In the recipe section, 
I’ll help do the matching for you.
Speaking of pasta, let’s head back 
to the principle with which we 
started the chapter: “get the best 
ingredients you can. And don’t 
screw ’em up too much.” Italian 
cuisine, in general, provides 
many good examples of how one 
can make a seriously delicious 
dish with a few simple, quality 
components that require minimal 
cooking and handling. Take 
spaghetti aglio e olio , for example. 
It’s a classic pasta dish made 
with three primary ingredients: 
spaghetti, olive oil, and garlic (to 
which you will eventually add 
salt, pepper, and grated cheese). 
When it’s made properly, with very 
good olive oil, these three simple 
ingredients combine together to 
become, as they say, greater than 
the sum of their parts. However, 
making it well takes a little 
understanding and practice. One has to know how to ensure that 
the pasta is “al dente,” meaning 
cooked to the proper texture so 
that it has a little chew to it. (Guys 
especially can appreciate that 
“soft” or “limp” are not favorable 
attributes; you must think of 
your pasta the same way.) And 
the garlic needs to be lightly and 
perfectly browned so as to release 
its full flavor without exposing 
its bitterness. Also, perhaps, 
how much of the pasta cooking 
water itself might be necessary 
to add back to the garlic oil 
“sauce,” so that it binds properly 
to the noodles and yields even 
distribution of sauce per noodle. 
No one wants some noodles 
naked while others are drenched 
in sauce. This is all relatively easy 
to do, but very important to the 
outcome of the dish. That’s where 
understanding technique comes 
into play, as well as knowing what 
not to do.21
Recipes for Disaster* (or What Not to Do)Now that you have your best 
ingredients on hand, here 
comes the other part of the 
equation: DON’T MESS THEM 
UP TOO MUCH. It’s obvious 
that you can screw up perfectly 
good ingredients if you don’t 
know what to do with them. 
However, whereas a lot of 
books will tell you what to do, 
I believe it is just as important 
to understand what not to do. 
My advice is clear: don’t try to 
do too much. In fact, generally 
speaking, the less you do with 
them, the better. What I have 
often found in my experience is 
that most of the mistakes that 
people make—and this goes 
for amateur chefs as well as 
professionals—come from the 
tendency to try to do too much. 
That goes for overcooking, over-
seasoning, over-saucing, too 
many ingredients, and too much 
handling. The DON’Ts are just as 
important as the DO’s.Life is complicated 
enough. Your meals 
shouldn’t have to be.
* There’s really no disaster in 
cooking. But you will surely 
minimize the chance for culinary 
catastrophe—particularly when 
cooking for an eager crowd—if 
you keep some of these thoughts 
in mind.
DON’T OVERCOOK: This is 
probably the most common 
mistake there is. Obviously we 
need enough heat and fire to make 
food taste good and to eliminate 
any potential concerns about 
bacteria that could arise from 
undercooked food. HOWEVER, 
overcooking food often ruins it. 
Overcooked vegetables become 
soggy and take on an unappetizing 
baby food texture. Moreover, it 
also leaches the vegetables of 
their nutritional value. Overcooked proteins—meat, poultry, seafood, 
and fish—get dried out, plain and 
simple. They get tough and lose 
their natural juice, which provides 
so much of the flavor. There comes 
a certain point in cooking beyond 
which you will have sucked out the 
entire flavor by overcooking. We’ve 
probably all had some experience 
eating food that was dried out by 
overcooking. For example, I would 
venture to say that three out of 
every four Thanksgiving turkeys 
served in this country are left in 
the oven for too long.
But it’s not just turkey. Overcooked 
shrimp gets rubbery. Overcooked 
fish is dry. Pasta becomes mushy. 
Casseroles lose liquid and turn 
dense when they dry out. Even 
desserts fail—for example, 
soufflés fall—when overdone. 
And scrambled eggs, too, lose 
their fluffiness when they’re 
cooked too long. I firmly believe 
that more people would be eating CHAPTER THREE

22liver, as polarizing as it is (people 
just seem to loathe liver), if it 
was served a little bit pink inside 
instead of being overcooked to 
the point where it tastes like, 
well . . . liver. Overcooked liver 
tastes metallic and minerally  and 
its texture becomes hard and 
rubbery.
Listen, I understand that people 
might be concerned about possible 
illness from undercooking 
CERTAIN foods, but that doesn’t 
mean everything needs to be 
cooked to death. I also understand 
that some people prefer their meat 
very well done (although I don’t 
understand why). Remember this: 
if food is too rare you can always 
return it to the fire. But once you 
overcook it, you can’t go back and 
recapture the taste, texture, and 
vitality that you’ve lost.
DON’T OVERSAUCE: Very simply, 
this is the act of drowning food in 
sauce. I imagine people do this 
because they think the sauce is 
the star. Au contraire, mon frère . 
It’s just the opposite. Other than 
with certain pasta dishes, your 
main ingredient is the star and the 
sauce should be the supporting 
player.Sauce and gravy are meant to 
embellish our food, to enhance 
a dish’s flavor, to highlight your 
ingredients, not hide them. 
This applies to salad dressing, 
pasta sauce, gravy, au jus, or 
mayonnaise. Look, I like a good 
gravy as much as the next guy, 
but if I want soup, I’ll order soup. 
Too much sauce obscures the 
main ingredient and changes the 
flavor and character of a dish. It 
makes food heavy and soggy. A 
cream sauce or cheese sauce can 
deaden and overwhelm what’s 
underneath them. Ever have so 
much mayonnaise in a chicken 
salad sandwich that you can’t 
taste the chicken? The same rule 
holds with salad dressing, which 
is similar to a sauce because 
it ties all the salad ingredients 
together. In cooking school, it 
was a huge no-no to overdress 
a salad, and yet it’s done all the 
time in restaurants. Not only does 
it make the ingredients soggy, it 
covers their true taste.
Another example occurs in 
eating sushi. Some people insist 
on dousing the fish with soy 
sauce, which is naturally very 
salty. But when you’re paying 
that much for raw fish that’s not 
a flavor you want to mask. If you like soy sauce so much, you’d be 
better of dumping it on a bowl 
of plain rice than overwhelming 
your sushi with it. (By the way, 
you should not be dipping your 
sushi rice in the soy sauce, only 
the fish part.)
DON’T OVER-SEASON: Salt 
is more than good. It has been 
called the world’s most essential 
mineral. In fact, no ingredient is 
more important to bringing out 
the flavor of food than salt.
The human tongue is constructed 
to respond to four tastes: they 
are sweet (sugar), sour (lemon), 
bitter (think coffee, beer, dark 
chocolate), and salt. These are the 
sensations that excite the tongue, 
salt being the most common. In 
recipes, when you read the words 
“season,” as in “season to taste,” 
it generally refers to salt and 
pepper.
I happen to be a proponent 
of what is termed “to season 
aggressively.” That is, I use salt 
and pepper pretty liberally, and 
will actually “season” with them 
throughout the making of a recipe, 
not just when it’s complete. So if 
I’m sautéing some carrots, celery, 
and onion in preparation for a 23
Recipes for Disaster* (or What Not to Do)dish, I will “season” those, and 
then also sprinkle salt and pepper 
on whatever other components 
are added along the way. However, 
too much of a good thing is still 
too much, and too much salt 
can render a dish inedible. Note 
that salt levels are intensified as 
liquids reduce, so be conscious 
of that when adding salt to any 
reduction.
DON’T USE TOO MANY 
INGREDIENTS: This is a common problem in home cooking and at 
restaurants too: there is simply 
too much going into a dish and too 
much going onto the plate.
“Good food is simple 
food.”
—Jean Anthelme 
Brillat-Savarin
One of the greatest food writers of 
all time, Jean Anthelme Brillat-
Savarin, put it best when he said, “Good food is simple food.” When 
you think about your favorite 
foods, I bet most of them are 
pretty simple.
Too many ingredients in a 
dish often detract from the 
main ingredient, taking focus 
away from the food you want 
to concentrate on. They can 
distract the palate, masking the 
clarity of a flavor rather than 
enhancing it. A raw oyster, for 
example, is a thing of beauty 
SALT
Taste is entirely subjective. But what’s certain is that nothing is more effective at bringing out the taste in 
food than salt. There are four common varieties: iodized table salt, kosher salt, sea salt, and fleur de sel  
(a type of sea salt). They’re all basically sodium chloride, so chemically, there is little difference between 
them. In fact, chemists think that anyone who would spend big bucks on all the fancy salts available 
these days are nuts. (But how often do you share nuts with a chemist?) However, there are significant 
differences in terms of where they come from and how they’re processed that not only affects their texture 
and shape, but importantly, how each interacts with food.
Many recipes that call for salt are referring to table salt. However, most cooks prefer to cook with 
kosher salt because its coarser grains make it easier to use and disperse, particularly when adding salt 
to foods with your fingers. And its “flaky” texture makes a better “crust” on meats or fish. It also tends to 
taste less salty because the fine grain a single teaspoon of table salt contains more salt than a tablespoon 
of kosher or sea salt. Sea salt comes from evaporating seawater.
Fleur de sel  is a type of sea salt that is harvested by hand; its high mineral content often makes it 
smell of the sea. Sea salts are best used to sprinkle on food at the last minute for a salty crunch.
FYI: If you oversalt a soup, drop a cut up raw potato into it to absorb the salt. Cream will whip better if you 
add a pinch of salt. And egg whites will beat faster and higher if you add a pinch of salt.Short Order Dad
24whose essence-of-the-sea taste 
could easily be enjoyed alone. 
It might be highlighted with 
a splash of lemon, perhaps a 
dash of hot sauce or a vinegar-
based mignonette sauce, but it 
doesn’t need more to reveal its 
flavor. Furthermore, too many 
ingredients give you a greater 
chance of messing things up. Of 
course there are many exceptions 
to this rule. You can’t make a 
decent paella or jambalaya, for 
example, without a whole load of 
ingredients. But this book is for 
people who don’t regularly make 
their own paella. Remember, 
we’re here to get the most flavor 
with the fewest ingredients and 
the least effort ™.
“The ambition of 
every good cook must 
be to make something 
very good with the 
fewest possible 
ingredients.” 
—Urbain Dubois
To be clear, I’m not suggesting 
that you can’t make extraordinary 
food with a ton of ingredients. I am 
saying that you don’t need a ton of 
ingredients to make extraordinary 
food. The point is that there are too many dishes made with too 
many ingredients that often don’t 
improve it, but complicate it 
unnecessarily. This “everything 
but the kitchen sink” approach 
to cooking more times than not 
diffuses the attention of your taste 
buds to the point where it’s hard to 
discern what you’re eating.
My experience is that a 
successful dish should focus 
on a main component and 
use the other ingredients to 
enhance its flavor. Think of it as 
a football team; there is only one 
quarterback who leads the team. 
Let’s use shrimp as the example. 
The shrimp is the quarterback, 
and we need the rest of the 
squad to help carry us into the 
end zone of shrimp scampi. The 
offensive line is the butter, the 
fullback handles the garlic, the 
receivers will bring the white 
wine and lemon juice, while the 
halfback completes the play with 
his parsley, salt, and pepper 
moves. The quarterback calls the 
play and the whole team works 
together to score a touchdown!
Most taste. Fewest 
ingredients. Least 
effort ™.Just as importantly, who wants 
to cook with so many ingredients 
anyway? A lot of ingredients 
generally means a lot more 
steps in the cooking process, 
which can be more complicated 
to manage. It means a lot of 
measuring and a lot of pans, too. 
When I see recipes that require 
too many more than seven or 
eight key ingredients, I either 
skip them or try to find ways 
to re-create them with fewer. 
Ideally, the fewer ingredients 
I have to work with, the better. 
Sure, more can be better. And 
while you should definitely 
enjoy the occasional beef 
Wellington and other complex 
fare that takes fifteen to twenty 
ingredients to make, leave that 
work to the professionals for 
now. I bet that when you think 
about your favorite foods, most 
of the time they’re pretty simple.
DON’T OVERHANDLE: The closer 
you get to food in its natural 
state, the better. The more it’s 
handled, the more you alter the 
food’s natural goodness. Think 
about freshly picked strawberries. 
They’re delicate little creatures. 
You can slice them and you can 
cook them, but you’re not going to 
meaningfully improve upon them 25
Recipes for Disaster* (or What Not to Do)from when they’re at their peak of 
natural flavor.
Guys like to play, and although I 
encourage playing with your food, 
you must avoid the temptation to 
do more than needs to be done, 
particularly if you are relatively 
new to cooking. Few foods are 
improved by more handling. You’ll notice this often when it comes to 
cooking over fire. People feel the 
need to turn food over constantly 
and move it around incessantly. 
Not only is that unnecessary, it’s 
actually detrimental, because it 
doesn’t allow the food to develop 
properly and often causes 
precious moisture to escape. As 
a general rule, you should let one side cook all the way, and then flip 
it over only one time. And, as any 
baker will tell you, overworking a 
dough can make baked goods too 
dense and chewy.
Before we start cooking, let’s talk 
tools.Short Order Dad
26Let’s be honest: you’re willing 
to spend a thousand bucks on 
a set of good golf clubs despite 
your handicap. You bought that 
hundred-dollar Nike softball 
glove for your weekend league. 
So if you want to be considered 
a decent cook, you’ve got to buy 
some serious gear. And unlike the 
clubs or the glove, an investment 
in the kitchen makes you instantly 
better.
Make the Cut
The place to start is with good 
knives, beginning with a high-
quality chef’s knife. Just like 
that new graphite racket, the 
most important consideration is 
how comfortable it feels in your 
hand. Look for high-carbon, 
stainless steel, one-piece 
construction, usually eight to ten 
inches long. But don’t hesitate 
to buy a six-inch version if it 
feels better. Remember, it's not the size of your sword, 
but the manner in which you 
use it. Wüsthof, Henckels, and 
Global are well known, but 
more expensive brand names, 
whereas Victorinox offers 
excellent choices for much less.
After the chef’s knife, the paring 
knife is probably the next one to 
have. It does all of the smaller 
cutting work that the chef’s knife 
doesn’t. That said, I probably use 
a “utility” knife as much as any 
knife I have. Running somewhere 
between four and six inches, a 
convenient midpoint between a 
chef and a paring, and can be 
used for all variety of slicing, 
dicing and trimming.
Finally, a good serrated knife 
would be ideal to have if you’re 
going to be slicing a lot of bread. 
Or cake. Or tomatoes.Take the Heat
Now, upgrade your cookware. 
There are two things to know 
about pots and pans. One is that 
there is no perfect material. The 
second is that thickness is the 
name of the game. Yes, you can 
scramble an egg on grandma’s 
hand-me-down tin pan, but 
to boost your game, get some 
quality pieces blessed with heavy 
bottoms. Begin with a good-size 
sauté pan. Cast-iron works well 
and it’s inexpensive. I love the 
way it holds heat and maximizes 
crispiness, and that it can be 
transferred directly from stove top 
into a waiting hot oven. The thing 
is it’s pretty heavy, which might 
make it somewhat impractical 
for everyday cooking. (And make 
sure you have an oven mitt 
because that handle gets HOT.) 
Aluminum is fine if you choose 
a heavy gauge (try Calphalon). 
The same holds true for stainless Tool Talk 
(It Helps to Have the Right Gear)27

• Tongs . Grabbing, holding, and 
pushing are penalties in most

• Kitchen scissors (or 
“shears”) . Underappreciated,

chicken, to snip fresh herbs, 
and also comes in handy to 
open that corrugated box that 
FedEx just delivered.
• Vegetable peeler . One of 
those $4.99 numbers. Until 
you have a sharp one, peeling 
potatoes will always seem like 
a prison job.
• Pepper mill . If you’re still 
using store-bought pre-ground 
pepper, it’s time to man up and grind your own. It’s a 
game-changer.
• Microplane grater.  A 
versatile, handheld gizmo used 
to grate fresh cheese, lemon 
peel, or nutmeg. Best to avoid 
your fingers, though, as they 
leave a distinct aftertaste.
• Whisk . Stainless steel. Your 
sauces should be as smooth as 
you are, lover boy. Now beat it.
• Instant-read thermometer . 
Why worry about undercooked, 
salmonella chicken or 
overdone, dried-out roasts? 
Just stick this little scorekeeper 
in your beef or bird and you’ll 
know precisely where you 
stand between well done and 
rare.
• Spatula . Seems obvious, 
right? Try the offset variety, 
cantilevered from the handle, 
making it particularly easy to 
manipulate inside a curved 
pan. Or splurge on a flexible 
one if you plan to cook a lot of 
fish.
• Strainer . Sure, you’ll need a 
colander to drain your pasta, but 
a small, fine-mesh strainer very 
often comes in handy for more 
than just cleaning cannabis. 
Like lemon juice, for example.
• Blender . Some jobs simply 
call for a power tool. This is the one you’ll want for sauces, 
soups, dressings, and perhaps 
most importantly, killer frozen 
margaritas.
• Oven mitts . Good ones that 
protect your delicate little 
paws up to 500 degrees or 
more. Nothing stings quite like 
scorching skin. (Plus it’s much 
harder to cook with only one 
good hand.)

basic techniques you’ll want to 
understand so you can get in 
there and play.29
Let’s Talk Technique: 10 FundamentalsYou could be a great cook. That 
starts with understanding 
some of the basics. These are ten 
essential techniques you should 
know about. Even if you don’t 
master all of them, learning any 
one of these techniques can be 
the key to turn you on to cooking. 
You will be able to make dishes 
and create tastes you were never 
able to before. And that’s with just 
one technique; imagine what’s 
possible now that I’m going to 
show you ten of them, which 
you can learn one at a time, or 
try several at once. Look, not 
everybody takes to every kind 
of cooking method. I discovered 
from my own cooking school 
experience that baking didn’t 
really do it for me, but there are 
plenty of people who are thrilled 
to be making cupcakes and pastry 
cream every day. Great. I loved 
the flames of fire under a pan. 
The sound of sizzling meats and 
poultry was music to my ears. And making sauces for them 
excited me. So, when a job called 
for searing, sautéing, or preparing 
something like a duck breast or a 
pork loin in a skillet on the stove, 
that was for me. Start by finding 
the techniques that are most 
interesting to you.
There are those who say that 
the invention of cooking actually 
drove the evolution of mankind. 
I don’t know about that, but I’m 
pretty sure that the discovery of 
fire certainly drove cooking. So, 
remember that fire is your friend. 
All due respect to the raw food 
movement (talk about three words 
that just should not go together—
RAW & FOOD & MOVEMENT), 
there is nothing that transforms 
food more or better than heat. 
It changes food’s color, texture, 
form, and flavor. Think about the 
multiple effects of heat on meat: it 
shrinks, it gets darker, it softens, 
and it turns real tasty. Cooking fruit makes it sweet and soft. 
With heat, certain other foods will 
blend together, like fat, flour, and 
liquid combine to make gravy.
“Cooking is the 
signature feature of 
the human diet, and 
indeed, of human life. 
It’s the development 
that underpins many 
other changes that 
have made humans so 
distinct from other 
species.”
—Harvard Professor 
R ichard Wrangham
Let’s begin with perhaps the most 
important principle.
1. CARAMELIZATION
In short, it’s the browning of food. 
Scientifically, caramelization is the CHAPTER FOUR
Let’s Talk Technique: 10 Fundamentals
Short Order Dad
30process of applying heat to sugar 
and converting it (by “browning 
it”) into caramel. Now this might 
come as somewhat of a surprise, 
but almost all foods—meats, 
fruits, and vegetables alike—
contain some natural sugar. 
With sufficient heat, starting at 
about 310°F , sugars break down, 
resulting in a brown color and 
a rich flavor. Caramelization, in 
other words, is the reason why 
everything from fried onions to 
grilled steak to dulce de leche  
tastes so damn good.  
There may be a whole bunch 
of fancy words to describe the 
caramelization process—for 
example, it’s technically called the “Maillard reaction”—but who 
gives a pork butt? All you need to 
know is that browning anything 
from an apple to chicken skin will 
result in better color and richer, 
more concentrated flavor. At its 
very simplest, caramelization is 
basically what makes food taste 
good. It’s what makes bread look 
like toast and turns potatoes into 
golden brown French fries. Of all 
the benefits that fire brings, this 
is surely one of the greatest. It is 
responsible for everything from 
the taste of perfectly charred 
steak and crackling chicken skin 
to caramel itself. And if you’ve 
ever held a marshmallow over 
a campfire, you have already caramelized something and are 
very familiar with its benefits.
The only utensils you need to 
caramelize are those that allow 
foods to come into contact with 
sufficient heat, but with little 
moisture: a sauté pan or skillet, 
a roasting pan for the oven, or a 
grill. In other words, you won’t 
get the caramelization effect from 
steaming or boiling.
It is not hard to do, either. If you 
want to practice caramelizing, 
simply slice an onion, any way 
you want. Add enough butter or 
oil to a frying pan, skillet, or sauté 
pan to cover the surface of the 
Sucs (pronounced suke)
When you brown meat you will undoubtedly notice some brown material accumulating and adhering to 
the bottom of your pot or pan. These caramelized bits are good. They’re called sucs . They’re loaded with 
flavor. And that flavor is the basis of many an excellent sauce. Your job, when it comes to sucs , is twofold: 
one is to make sure that you don’t burn the stuff. So lower the heat the second you see that your sucs  
might be in danger of burning. Or before that. The other is to deglaze. That is, using liquid to release the 
sucs  and form the foundation of a sauce, gravy, or jus.
The best sucs  are dark-golden brown, and the result of a few key steps. 1) Heat your pan and your 
lubrication (oil) before adding any ingredients. 2) Do not overcrowd the pan. Overcrowding is a problem 
in schools; it is also a problem in a pan because it creates steam and liquid rather than sucs . 3) Try not to 
leave too much exposed space between ingredients in the pan because that leaves greater opportunity for 
burning. Best to make sure you use a pan that is the right size for what you’re cooking, or cook in batches. 
No problem.31
Let’s Talk Technique: 10 Fundamentalspan. (Let’s say two tablespoons.) 
Put on a medium flame, add 
onions, a pinch of salt, and give an 
occasional stir. Check back every 
few minutes to watch how they’re 
changing color. First they’ll soften. 
Then you’ll start to notice as they 
become more translucent. Finally, 
over time, they’ll begin to brown. 
When they reach the shade of 
brown you find appealing (browner 
= better and burnt = bad), 
congratulate yourself, because you 
have just successfully caramelized 
an onion.
Drop it on your burger, mix it into 
your eggs, or serve it on top of 
mashed potatoes. In fact, do with 
it whatever pleases you now that 
you are officially a caramelizing 
professional. It is a technique you 
will use over and over again with 
fruit, vegetables, and proteins like 
meat and poultry (not to mention 
sugar, marshmallows, nuts, fruits, 
toast, and more). Furthermore, be 
aware that when you caramelize 
meats and poultry, the residue that 
remains in the pan (the sucs ) is 
the basis of a truly excellent sauce.
2. DEGLAZING
Deglazing is a fancy term for the 
technique that takes the browned 
bits left in the bottom of the pan from caramelizing and dissolves 
them with liquid. These deposits, 
called sucs , which remain in the 
pan after proteins like meat or 
poultry is cooked, are loaded with 
flavor. (Even the words “browned 
bits” have me salivating.) The 
benefit of deglazing is to gather up 
all that flavor so it can be used to 
make a great sauce or gravy.
Once the cooked protein and 
excess fat are removed from the 
pan, liquid is added—such as 
water, stock, cream or alcohol—
thus allowing you to scrape, 
dislodge, and dissolve these 
dark, supercharged pellets of 
flavor from the bottom of the pan, 
thereby extracting all the flavor 
possible. It is common practice 
to add aromatic vegetables—
like onions, shallots, garlic, 
scallions—to your pan BEFORE 
YOU ADD THE LIQUID, allowing 
them to cook briefly, just long 
enough to release their flavor, 
which you will happily smell. This 
adds another dimension to the 
liquid mixture you’re making.
Deglazing the pan is the first step 
of any one of a number of things 
you can do with this flavorful 
liquid, from using it as a sauce 
itself to making it the base of a more complex sauce. You can 
season the liquid and serve it 
just as is, in which case you will 
have made a quick, flavorful 
basic sauce known as a jus, as in 
chicken au jus. You can thicken 
it by adding some starch (like 
flour) or smooth out the flavor and 
texture by whisking in cold butter. 
You can also thicken it naturally 
by reducing the liquid over heat, 
which will create a more intense, 
concentrated flavor.
It is worth noting that you want 
to remove excess fat before you 
start deglazing. Who wants greasy 
gravy? Too much fat is undesirable 
because it coats the tongue and 
obscures flavors. Although much 
less frequently employed, it is 
also possible to “deglaze” a pan 
using vegetables instead of liquid 
IF they are watery-type vegetables 
such as onions, celery, or spinach. 
Their water content will have the 
same dislodging effect.
For your first attempt, you 
might try this:  remove a 
beautifully brown chicken from 
the roasting pan you’ve cooked 
it in, strain off the excess fat in 
the pan, and over heat, stir in a 
minced clove of garlic and cook 
until fragrant, about a minute. Short Order Dad
32Then add a cup of water and stir 
around vigorously, making sure 
you scrape up all the brown bits in 
the bottom until they are dissolved 
into the liquid. A wooden spoon is 
best. Keep stirring until the liquid 
is uniform. It’s official: you have 
just deglazed. Next, taste to see if 
it needs any salt and pepper. You 
can pour this flavorful mixture 
over the chicken as is, and serve 
chicken au jus, or you can add 
a variety of other elements to it, 
from mustard to herbs to butter, 
and more. You could also keep 
cooking it until it reaches a thicker 
consistency. You can strain it 
before using so it contains no bits 
of anything floating in it. Ahhh, 
there you go—not only have you 
deglazed a pan, you have just 
completed the first step toward 
entering the Sauce Making Hall of 
Fame. You rock star!
3. REDUCTION
Reduction is the process of 
cooking a liquid mixture to thicken 
it and intensify its flavor, which 
is accomplished by the magic of 
evaporation. The key benefit of 
reduction is a more concentrated 
flavor from the liquid you are 
reducing. Learning how to do this 
very simple technique will open 
a whole new world of cooking for you because it allows you to make 
sauces, gravy, syrup, and more. 
You will automatically become a 
better cook because your dishes 
will have more flavor, better 
taste, and a more sophisticated 
flair. Let’s face it: many times the 
sauce makes the dish. Who wants 
to eat a plain plate of noodles? 
Some dishes just aren’t the same 
without sauce. That’s why this 
technique expands your cooking 
prowess immeasurably.
The reduction method is 
commonly used to make 
gravies, sauces, and syrups 
by reducing different liquids—
for example, stocks, wine, or 
milk—depending, of course, 
on what you’re making. 
Whereas other methods of 
making sauce might require 
the addition of thickening 
agents, such as starches like 
flour or cornstarch, the thicker 
consistency you get through 
reduction is accomplished 
without any additives. In fact, 
there are times that liquids 
are reduced to the thickness of 
“syrup.” The gooey consistency 
of caramel sauce, for example, 
is made with sugar and cream 
that has been reduced down in 
volume. Any decent wine sauce you’ve ever had has undoubtedly 
been achieved through reduction 
from the time it left the bottle. 
Reduction produces a richer 
tasting and smoother product.
As the cook, you control the 
consistency of the reduction, 
which can range anywhere from 
the thinness of apple juice to the 
thickness of a syrupy glaze like 
the caramel. That consistency 
depends on what you’re using the 
liquid for. As in the example I cited 
before, when roasting a chicken, I 
will deglaze the roasting pan with 
a cup of water and reduce that 
liquid down by about one half to 
produce a wonderful jus with the 
natural drippings from the bird. 
On the other hand, when making 
Thanksgiving turkey, I want a 
thicker gravy and a lot more of 
it, so I will start with about four 
cups of liquid and reduce it until 
it yields just one. It is important 
to remember that the more you 
reduce a liquid, the more you 
magnify the flavor(s) of what’s 
in it. So be careful with salt and 
sugar levels, because what starts 
out sweet and salty becomes even 
more so.
There is a direct relationship 
between the amount of liquid 33
Let’s Talk Technique: 10 Fundamentalsyou begin with and the heat 
required to reduce it to a desired 
consistency. A lot of liquid in a 
pan needs higher heat to reduce 
it and/or more time. The closer 
you get to a syrupy glaze, the 
more you have to moderate and 
keep your eye on the heat. You can 
use any stove-top pot to reduce 
liquids; just make sure that the 
pot is large enough to hold the 
amount of liquid you start with.
When deglazing a large roasting 
pan, like one used for turkey, I 
begin with the pan over heat on 
top of the stove and scrape up the 
brown sucs . (It can actually cover 
two burners simultaneously.) 
Then, once I have deglazed, I 
transfer the liquid from this pan 
to a smaller pot so that I can 
reduce the liquid over a single 
flame. Not only does that give me 
more control, but also allows me 
to add liquid and any necessary 
ingredients to build a sauce or 
gravy. If your only intention is to 
make a jus, that can be done right 
in the roasting pan and poured 
directly over your dish.
If you want to practice, try this: 
put a half cup of regular, generic 
balsamic vinegar in a saucepan, 
add a sprig of thyme, and simmer over medium heat until it gets 
as thick as maple syrup. There, 
you’ve just completed your first 
reduction. Not only will you 
see the texture change, but the 
reduction also accentuates the 
natural sweetness in balsamic, 
which creates a good topping to 
drizzle over vegetables, chicken, 
or fish. Taste a tiny bit of it on your 
next piece of plain grilled chicken 
or asparagus. Or swirl a little bit 
on the side of a plate as a design. 
There, now you’re a food stylist, 
too.
A reduction is simply 
done by cooking 
down the liquid in a 
pan until it reaches 
the volume and 
consistency you want.
4. BRAISING
Braising is a method of cooking 
that uses wet heat. You are 
simmering food in liquid, like 
water, wine, or stock, over a low 
heat for a long time, in a tightly 
covered pot. Braising has also 
been referred to as pot-roasting 
and is a similar method to 
stewing, but in stews the meat 
is generally cut into even pieces 
and cooked in enough liquid to cover. Nor is braising the same 
as poaching, which is a process 
of gently simmering food in 
liquid, and is generally used for 
“gentle” food, hence such dishes 
as poached eggs and poached 
salmon. Braising is characterized 
by long, slow cooking using an 
amount of liquid that covers about 
half to two-thirds of the main 
ingredient. Braising is most often 
used for tough cuts of meat that 
need to cook gently until tender. 
The most common types of foods 
that are braised are beef, pork, 
and chicken, as well as vegetables 
such as leeks, onions, and 
cabbage.
Even if you’ve never made it 
yourself, you’ve undoubtedly had 
braised food before in restaurants. 
You might recognize it from that 
feeling you get when you’re eating 
something so tender that it “falls 
right off the bone.” Most often, 
that experience is from a dish that 
has been braised, like braised 
short ribs of beef, the brisket at 
a delicatessen, or the osso buco  
(braised veal shank, page 103) 
at an Italian restaurant. In fact, 
the popularity of this technique 
lends itself to the cooking of many 
cultures. If you can braise, you can 
make chicken cacciatore (Italy), Short Order Dad
34coq au vin and boeuf  Bourguignon  
(France), pork braised in soy sauce 
(China), and any number of other 
superb dishes. So braise away!
Braising is an excellent cooking 
method for four good reasons:
1. It is brilliant in bringing 
out the best in tougher and 
cheaper cuts of meat. When 
you’re working with less 
expensive meats, which are 
often tougher, the effect of 
moisture and heat over time 
breaks them down to become 
soft and fall-off-the-bone 
tender.
2. In successful braising, the 
liquid merges with and 
absorbs the flavors of the 
other ingredients, creating an 
excellent sauce. The beauty 
of it is that it requires no extra 
steps to make the sauce; the 
braising process itself makes 
the sauce. When you serve a 
dish that has been braised, 
it is served in a puddle of the 
braising liquid.
3. It’s super efficient because 
all the cooking is done in one 
pot. The classic vessel for 
this type of cooking is called a Dutch oven*, but one can also 
use either a stockpot or really 
any heavy-bottomed pot that’s 
large enough to hold all the 
ingredients, and has a tight 
fitting lid.
*Don’t be disgusting. Yes, I’m 
talking to you.
4. You get a double bonus: it’s hard 
to screw up and the results are 
usually stunningly tasty.
The steps for braising are 
remarkably easy. Let’s talk about 
meat. Meat is usually seared 
first in some hot fat to achieve 
the color and taste benefits of 
caramelization. That is known 
as a “brown” braise, whereas a 
“white” braise (i.e., no browning 
in advance) would more typically 
be used for fish or vegetables. 
Then, you will usually add 
aromatic vegetables, such as 
onions, garlic, carrots, and 
celery, after which the liquid is 
added. The pot is then covered 
and the liquid simmers over 
low heat for a fairly long time. 
I braise beef brisket (page 99), 
for example, for at least two 
hours. The cooking can be done 
on the stove top or in the oven, 
where the more even distribution of heat better prevents any 
burning, as long as you ensure 
that the liquid is simmering (i.e., 
meaning that it’s moving gently 
rather than vigorously). You 
can be fairly sure that it will be 
simmering if the oven is at 350°F , 
but if you want to be absolutely 
sure you can open the oven door 
quickly and check.
Fish can be braised as well, 
but because it’s more delicate 
than meat, it is usually done at 
a lower temperature and for a 
shorter time. You can, and should, 
also braise vegetables. In fact, 
one of my favorite dishes from 
cooking school was braised leeks, 
otherwise known by its fancy 
French name, poireaux étuvés 
(pwa-ROH ay-too-VAY) (see recipe 
on page 179). It was the first time I 
ever knowingly ate leeks and they 
were surprisingly sensational. And 
so simple to do. Braised in water 
with a dash of oil or butter and 
salt, they became sweet, creamy, 
and tender. Really delicious. 
Although cleaning the leeks is a 
slight pain in the butt—they can be 
dirty and sandy—it is well worth 
the effort. (If you want dirt in your 
food, eat it right from the ground.)  
Braised celery is also surprisingly 
tasty, but you can braise a lot of 35
Let’s Talk Technique: 10 Fundamentalsdifferent veggies, from artichokes 
and cabbage to tomatoes and 
turnips, to yield exciting results.
Now remember, magnificence 
can’t be rushed. Once you handle 
the simple pregame prep, 
which usually involves some 
slicing, seasoning, and searing, 
your ingredient becomes like a 
reluctant starlet who wants to be 
left alone—at least for a couple of 
hours. But that’s good, too, people.
Life is fast enough; 
dinner shouldn’t 
always have to be. 
5. ROASTING
Unlike braising, roasting is 
cooking entirely with dry heat, 
probably the earliest cooking 
method. These days, food is most 
often roasted in the oven, but 
can also be done on a rotisserie 
or even an open flame (for you 
campers and cavemen). The idea 
is to achieve even cooking on all 
sides, with the primary benefit of 
enhanced flavor, again through the 
magic of caramelization. Have you 
ever bitten into the crispiest piece 
of roast chicken or pork skin? 
Well, those fabulous little bites of 
pure palate pleasure come from proper roasting. And you now 
know that the by-product of the 
caramelization that remains in the 
cooking pan itself can become the 
basis for an extraordinary sauce.
Generally, roasting is ideal for 
poultry, of course, as well as 
more tender meats (“roasts”), 
potatoes and many other 
vegetables, such as cauliflower, 
squash, and Brussels sprouts. 
“Root vegetables,” such as 
carrots and parsnips, are 
particularly good candidates 
for roasting because the longer 
cooking time fully brings out 
their naturally sweet flavor 
(caramelization again!) and 
softens them, too. Nuts are 
another category of food that 
benefit mightily from oven 
roasting. Raw nuts are really 
good for you; roasted nuts—
cashews, almonds, peanuts, 
pecans, and the rest—are so 
delicious that they’re addictive.
Roasting is usually a slower 
method of cooking. The term “low 
and slow” refers to temperature 
and time when roasting. The 
benefit of slow roasting is that there 
is less loss of moisture, resulting 
in a more tender, “juicy” product. 
Also, you can’t really expect to roast a big old hunk of meat too quickly, 
or at too high a temperature. 
Otherwise, you’d end up with a too 
crisp exterior and rawness inside. 
Ideally, what you’re looking for in 
roasting is to achieve a beautiful 
brown, dark crust on the outside 
and a moist interior. In fact, it is not 
unusual for cooks to “sear” (that’s 
browning by exposing to high 
temperature) the outside of meat 
first prior to placing it in the oven to 
cook all the way through. (Although 
it had been commonly believed that 
searing would “lock in” moisture, I 
must report that is simply not the 
case. Moisture loss is an inevitable 
function of heat and time.) However, 
searing is ideal for browning the 
outside and developing flavor. The 
objective of roasting, in any case, 
is to retain as much moisture as 
possible while developing the 
desired texture and color.
I recognize there are people who 
prefer their meat well done and 
many of us like the taste of char, 
but as I might have mentioned 
before, the last thing you want to 
end up with anything you cook is 
something that tastes like a dried-
out shoe. Red meats such as beef 
and lamb are often roasted to 
“pink,” which means it might be 
medium, medium rare, or even Short Order Dad
36rarer. Safety dictates that you don’t 
use this practice with poultry, 
which is particularly susceptible 
to a certain type of bacteria, so it 
has to reach a certain temperature 
to be safe.
In roasting “managing the heat” 
is key. You don’t want to overcook 
or undercook. The objective is 
to retain as much moisture as 
possible with the right texture and 
a golden brown color. Because 
roasting is often done slowly over 
long times, it is not uncommon to 
baste the food with fats or liquids 
to maintain moisture that is 
naturally lost though evaporation. 
Roasted vegetables’ readiness 
can often be gauged by sight; 
for fish, you may have to do 
some poking around to ensure 
it’s cooked all the way through. 
However, the one surefire way to 
guarantee success for meat or 
poultry is to use a thermometer 
to measure internal temperature 
as the way to ensure it’s cooked 
safely all the way through.
There are lots of theories about 
what constitutes the right 
temperature. My opinion is that it 
generally doesn’t matter whether 
you start the oven with high 
temperature or low or keep it uniform throughout. What matters 
is ending up with moist meat and a 
golden brown surface at the same 
time. One way to achieve that is to 
start the oven at a very high heat 
and then to reduce the temperature 
accordingly. Another way, 
particularly in the case of meat, like 
a rack of lamb, is to “sear” or brown 
it before roasting it in the oven.
For equipment, all you need is a 
working oven and pan. (Although 
I have also roasted in cast-iron 
skillets plenty of times with 
particularly favorable results. 
It’s very effective at searing and 
crisping skin, but since it holds in 
heat and will be in direct contact 
with ingredients, you’ve got to keep 
your eyes on the goods to ensure 
that don’t get too crispy.) As far as 
recipes go, you pretty much always 
need to preheat your oven—that 
is, turning it on and getting it to the 
indicated temperature before you 
put your food in. Almost every recipe 
bases cooking times on a preheated 
oven. And since everyone’s oven is 
different and not always calibrated 
to exactly the number it says on 
your dial, it wouldn’t hurt to have 
an oven thermometer, or even 
better, to invest in an instant-read 
thermometer. For about fifteen 
bucks, this little tool will tell you instantly whether your meal is 
cooked perfectly or is perfectly raw 
inside.
Notes on heat:
• Always preheat the oven to the 
temperature you’ll be roasting 
at and have your ingredients at 
room temperature .
• Know that roasted meats will 
continue to cook even after 
they’re removed from the 
oven. This phenomenon, called 
“carryover cooking,” is due to 
the residual heat from all that 
time in the oven.
• Let your roast rest! Please. 
After all that time in the hot 
oven, recipes should always 
inform you to let roasted meats 
and poultry sit (for anywhere 
from five minutes to half an 
hour, depending on ingredient 
and roasting time) in order for 
the juices to regenerate and 
resurface. If you cut into a roast 
too soon, you will lose most 
of the moist interior you’re 
looking for. The longer it cooks, 
the longer you need to let it rest 
before carving.
• If you’re roasting a large cut of 
beef, it’s a good idea to tie it up 
with string before you put it in the 
oven. This will hold it together 
and promote even cooking.37
Let’s Talk Technique: 10 Fundamentals• Covering. Okay, I know I 
said clearly that roasting is 
UNCOVERED, but . . . if you’re 
roasting a turkey and the 
skin is starting to get a little 
too brown before the meat is 
cooked, one way to deal with 
that is to selectively cover the 
skin with aluminum foil while you continue cooking. That 
will allow the bird to continue 
cooking without ruining the 
skin.
• “Aromatic” vegetables, like 
onion, celery, and carrot, 
are frequently added to the 
roasting pan. They add flavor 
and moisture. Keep your eye on them, though, to ensure 
they don’t burn.
• Broiling, under your oven’s 
broiler, is not roasting. But it is 
quite effective for melty cheese, 
a crusty top, and a caramelized 
coating. Just pay attention —
that is, don’t leave the kitchen 
while you’re doing it.
Oven temperature.  My oven isn’t “calibrated.” Yours probably isn’t, either. That means there is likely 
a difference between my 350°F and yours. And that will affect cooking times. So you have to keep your 
eye on food as it cooks. The point is that cooking times are always approximate. The one surefire way 
to guarantee that your food is cooked properly is to invest about fifteen bucks in a digital instant-read 
thermometer. That way, regardless of oven temperature and settings, you can poke a piece of protein to 
instantly ascertain its degree of doneness. If you love it medium rare, you are not going to be happy with 
medium well.

6. SAUTÉ
Saut é literally means to jump  
in French. In food preparation, 
to sauté is to move or “jump” 
ingredients quickly in a pan 
over relatively high heat with 
a minimal amount of fat. The 
idea is to brown the food while 
preserving its moisture. So do as 
Van Halen would and go ahead 
and jump.
When using high heat, you don’t 
want burning, so you’ve got to 
keep the ingredients jumping. 
Because of the limited use of fat, it 
is a relatively healthy technique.
If you’ve ever watched a TV cooking 
show and have seen chefs flipping food around a pan, they’re sautéing. 
Until you become skilled at that, 
you might want to use a utensil 
like a wooden spoon to keep the 
contents hopping around. Sautéing 
is a fast way to ease flavor out of 
foods that can be cooked quickly, 
so it is most successful when used 
for vegetables and thin cuts of meat 
or seafood that lend themselves to 
a quick cooking technique. Thinly 
sliced chicken breast, shrimp, 
onions, and mushrooms are all 
good examples. The ideal result is 
that you will caramelize the outer 
surface of what you’re sautéing 
and simultaneously cook the 
inside sufficiently as well. In other 
words, you’ll be looking for a little 
browning.Sautéing is different from 
panfrying. In a sauté, the pieces 
of food are kept small and cooked 
quickly. Panfrying is done with 
larger ingredients (think pork 
chops) and cooked thoroughly 
on one side before being turned 
over to cook the other. Sautéing 
is not the same as searing either. 
Remember that in searing, you’re 
only cooking the surface of the 
food to brown it effectively. The 
cooking method that is closest 
to sautéing is stir-frying. The 
primary difference is that stir-
frying is an ancient Chinese 
method, usually done using a 
wok. They both use high heat 
and a little lubrication to cook 
small-sized ingredients quickly. Note: The government plays it safe, as it should. However, their suggested temperatures can lead to overcooked proteins at 
times. Therefore, just another reminder here that you might consider removing your meat or poultry from the heat source 
before it reaches the desired temperature (not eons before—but 5-10 degrees below the desired temperature will generally 
work). Remember that "residual" or "carryover" cooking will continue to cook the food—and raise its temperature—even 
after it has been taken from the heat, especially  for those proteins that are larger and have been cooked for a longer time.39
Let’s Talk Technique: 10 FundamentalsThe wok’s rounded pan facilitates 
the perpetual motion of the 
ingredients. Somewhat like a 
sauté, “sweating” is the term 
used to describe the technique 
of cooking aromatic vegetables 
over low heat in a little fat so as to 
soften them without letting them 
brown. It is often a preliminary 
step to making soups, sauces, 
and braises.
The five basic rules of sautéing:
1. Use a very hot pan. 
Remember, this is a quick 
cooking method.
2. Lubricate LIGHTL Y with fat. 
You’ll need lubrication even 
if you are using a nonstick 
skillet. You generally use fat of 
some sort, most commonly oil 
or butter, but not too much of it. 
This is not frying and you don’t 
want greasy; you’re looking for 
brown and crisp, not leaden.
3. Make sure your ingredients 
are dry. Otherwise too much 
liquid accumulates in the pan 
and again leads to soggy. 
The idea in sautéing is to 
eliminate some of the natural 
“water” from the ingredients; 
in this case, their water 
content is barrier to full flavor.4. Do not crowd the pan. 
Overcrowding in our schools 
is a problem; same in our 
sauté pans. Ingredients need 
direct access to the heat from 
the bottom of the pan. More 
than one layer of food in the 
pan and you get mush.
5. Do not cover the pan. The 
effect of covering is to steam, 
which leads to soggy. That is 
the opposite of what we’re 
looking for, which is crisp.
Utensils: For most sautés , your 
average, everyday frying pan will 
do. Or a skillet, or what they call a 
sauté pan. Although skillets with 
flat sides rather than rounded 
ones will keep more food inside 
the pan—rather than jumping out 
of it—pans with rounded sides, 
like woks, which are shaped like 
big bowls, facilitate the perpetual 
motion of the ingredients. 
Remember, if it’s not jumping, 
you’re not really sautéing.
If you want to practice: Different 
foods with different textures have 
different cooking times. However, 
in performing a sauté all the 
ingredients are thrown in the pan 
at once and they’re cooked quickly. 
Your sauté pan must be large 
enough to hold all of the food in one layer. The food has to be in direct 
contact with the heat underneath 
it and in direct contact with the air 
above it; it can’t be covered by other 
food or a lid. That’s because we 
don’t want our sauté to be a failure, 
which it will be if we steam and 
stew the food rather than brown it.
Because we’re cooking quickly over 
high heat, you must keep moving 
the ingredients frequently, either 
by moving them around rapidly 
with a spatula or, by jerking the pan 
repeatedly to make the ingredients 
“jump.” The sauté technique 
involves gripping the handle of the 
sauté pan firmly, and using a sharp 
elbow motion to rapidly jerk the pan 
back toward the cook, repeating 
as necessary to insure that the 
ingredients have been thoroughly 
jumped. This is what you always 
see the TV chefs do, and with a 
little practice, you will be doing it 
yourself in no time. Although, in the 
beginning, expect that there will be 
food flying everywhere.
“The sauté is a 
method that should 
come most naturally 
to men because it 
requires repeated

Clarified butter is what you get when you remove the “milk solids” and water from regular butter. When 
those milk solids and water are (easily) removed, you are left with pure butterfat. The advantage of this 
clarified butter, especially as it pertains to sautéing, is that it can be used at a much higher temperature 
without burning or browning. Regular butter will burn at high heat because of those milk solids, whereas 
clarified butter has a much higher “smoke point.”
How to clarify butter:  You certainly don’t need to, but it’s easier than it might sound. Melt butter slowly 
over low heat and let it sit for a few minutes. No stirring. Then skim and discard all that white foam off the 
top and carefully pour the liquefied butterfat into a dish or container, leaving behind the “milky solids” in 
the bottom of the pan. (You could also strain the melted butter through cheese cloth or a coffee filter—I’ve 
even used a paper towel.) You want to end up with just pure golden liquid, no white bits. And by the way, 
it’s always better to cook with unsalted butter so that YOU can control the dish’s salt level. Incidentally, you 
can also buy ghee , the clarified butter used in Indian cooking. 
7. SEASONING
In general, seasoning is the 
process of using salt, pepper, 
herbs, and spices to give flavor 
to food. It should be pointed out 
that that the strictest definition 
of seasoning refers only to the 
addition of salt to a preparation. 
However, for the purposes of us 
home cooks, we’ll cover the whole 
category. When it comes to herbs 
and spices, recipes will specify 
amounts, but you will also notice 
that many recipes include the 
instruction to “taste and adjust 
for seasoning as necessary.” 
That seasoning refers to salt and 
pepper, an amount that varies by 
person depending on their taste.So this is a good moment to 
mention that no seasoning is more 
important than salt. More than any 
other seasoning in the world, salt 
is what brings out flavor in food. 
Most savory food, like meats or 
poultry, would have relatively no 
taste without salt. Why? There is 
nothing in the ingredient inherently 
that would trigger any of your 
taste buds, which are responsive 
only to sweet, bitter, sour, or 
salt. This should come as no 
surprise to anyone who has ever 
eaten. Just read the ingredients 
on food labels and you will see 
salt in almost everything, even 
foods you don’t think of as savory, 
such as desserts. Most cakes, cookies, brownies, cereals, etc. 
have salt in them for the same 
reason mentioned earlier—it 
brings out flavor in food. However, 
we Americans tend to go a little 
overboard on just about everything, 
and that includes salt, which 
causes high blood pressure. 
Consequently, salt overuse can 
actually become somewhat of a 
health hazard. Anyone who has 
a condition that will limit their 
salt intake will probably have to 
use salt substitutes and can also 
compensate by using herbs and 
spices; but as a cook, I have to 
admit that real salt is virtually 
irreplaceable in terms of its impact 
on food’s flavor.41
Let’s Talk Technique: 10 FundamentalsUMAMI
What is it that makes some foods taste really, really good? It could be umami, the “fifth taste.”
All of our lives we’ve been told that the tongue can discern four different tastes. Well it turns out all 
these years later that there’s a fifth taste your tongue can identify. It’s called umami. It’s almost like being 
told that Pluto is no longer a planet. Anyway, umami is actually a “savory” sensation. What’s savory? It’s 
that rich, deep flavor you get in your mouth from foods like cheese, and steak with mushrooms. You know 
that big explosion of flavor you get in your mouth when you take a bite of blue cheese? That’s because it’s 
an umami rich food. As is meat. As are oysters. And sautéed mushrooms, for example. All foods rich with 
umami.
Now, you may not have heard of umami before, but I can assure you that chefs have. That’s why when 
you go to a restaurant you often have a meal that leaves you wondering why you can’t cook like that at 
home. It’s because they know how to maximize the umami—or the taste quotient—of what you’re eating. 
But if you want to add some extra umami flavor to your cooking at home, it’s not that hard to do. When 
you make a vegetable soup, for example, add in a whole handful of shiitake or porcini mushrooms. When 
you’re making a sauce, it’s a good idea to put in some tomato paste because it adds a depth and richness 
of flavor. And any time you add soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce to a preparation, you’re bringing an 
element of umami to your meal.
If you don’t feel like cooking, then go out to a steak restaurant for an umami blast. Ever wonder why 
people are having such a good time at a steak house joint? Look at the menu. You start off with a shrimp 
cocktail, followed by a Caesar salad with anchovies and cheese in it. And a beautiful piece of steak with 
mushroom sauce. All umami-rich foods!
(Plus, that goblet of Cabernet doesn’t hurt either.)
Now that we’ve touched on salt, it’s 
time to talk about some of the most 
important herbs and spices. First, 
herbs are aromatic plants. Parsley, 
sage, rosemary, and thyme is more 
than just a song lyric; they are 
some of the most common herbs.
Herbs can be used either 
fresh or dried, depending on availability and recipe. They 
are mostly interchangeable in 
cooking—recipes tend to suggest 
use dried herbs in dishes that 
cook for a long time—but I could 
NEVER imagine a platter of 
beautiful tomatoes, served with 
a fresh mozzarella and drizzled 
with fragrant olive (with a pinch 
of salt of course) that was topped by sprinkle of dried basil instead 
of fresh. That just doesn’t fly. The 
point is that there is an ideal use 
for both; fresh herbs are usually 
preferred when consuming fresh 
food or for preparations that do 
not require long cooking, such 
as braising and roasting, when 
dried herbs serve the purpose 
well.Short Order Dad
42Like herbs, spices are also the 
aromatic by-product of plants. The 
primary difference is that spices 
are usually sold in seed or powder 
form and they are quite fragrant, 
or sharp flavored. The most widely 
use spices are pepper(corns), 
cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, 
bay leaves, cumin, and chile. 
Certain dishes are unimaginable 
(impossible, actually) without 
spices. It wouldn’t be much of a chili 
without chili powder or a very tasty 
gingerbread cookie without ginger. 
Entire cuisines are dependent on 
certain herbs and spices. What 
would a Chinese meal taste like 
without ginger, scallion, and garlic? 
Indian food without curry powder, 
Hungarian food without paprika? 
I don’t think so. Indeed, apart 
from salt, herbs and spices are 
what bring maximum flavor and 
pleasure to all that we eat.
 “Variety’s the very 
spice of life that gives 
it all its flavor.” 
—William CowperWhen Flavors Collide
As a general rule, certain herbs 
and spices pair well with certain 
foods. As a second general rule, 
certain herbs and spices clash 
with certain foods and with each 
other. I’ll never forget roasting 
a chicken in cooking school that 
I flavored with rosemary and 
tarragon. A no-no, apparently. 
My teacher tasted it and instantly 
pointed out that the rosemary, an 
herb de Provence , did not belong 
together with the tarragon, one 
of the fines herbes. (I told you 
French cooking is disciplined.)
In baking, it is common to see 
cinnamon and nutmeg used 
together, and sometimes allspice 
and clove, too. The so-called 
herbes de Provence  (thyme, 
rosemary, basil, bay, savory) are 
commonly combined in French 
food. Oregano, marjoram, and 
basil are big in Italian and Greek 
cookery. Then you have the 
intensely aromatic flavors of 
cumin, coriander, and cardamom. Their lively flavors wake up 
recipes from other parts of the 
world, but trust me when I tell 
you that they would not go well 
with dishes whose flavor profile 
is distinctly Italian, French, or 
American influenced. Or don’t 
trust me and judge for yourself.
In the beginning, you should 
follow recipes as they are 
intended, but over time and with 
a little more experience in the 
kitchen, I would encourage you to 
improvise and try new things. Just 
remember that when it comes 
to experimenting with herbs and 
spices, some work very well 
together and some don’t. Knowing 
how to season, what to season 
with, and what seasonings go best 
with what foods will make you a 
far better cook. And it’s not too 
hard to learn.43
Let’s Talk Technique: 10 FundamentalsThree Herbs and Spices That Will Instantly Improve Your Cooking
It is amazing how easy it can be to add a lot of flavor to food. That may sound obvious, but we often eat the 
very same food, prepared the very same way, over and over again. Yet, with the simple shake of a little 
glass jar, you can bring an entirely new and exciting taste dimension to your meals.
Here are three readily available herbs and spices that I use frequently to totally titillate my taste buds.
1. Ancho Chile Powder.  The word “chile” does not necessarily translate into “spicy.” Of course there 
are chilies that will blow your doors off, but there are also those that are mild, and others that are 
even considered kind of “fruity.” The ancho chile is one of those, not hot, but with a mellow hint of 
raisin. You can buy and cook them whole, but I suggest you use the already ground powder. (Available 
in many supermarkets.) You’ll have to decide for yourself, but to me it brings an earthy, fragrant New 
Mexican accent to foods. Sprinkle it on chicken pieces before roasting or season raw shrimp with it 
(and salt) and then sauté in a little olive oil with sliced garlic, finishing it with a squeeze of lime and 
fresh chopped cilantro. Nothing wrong with that. Not only delicious, the powder adds an appetizing 
rust color to your dish.
2. Smoked Spanish Paprika.  Also called piment ón, it’s very much in vogue these days among the 
foodies, which is understandable because it’s the simplest way conceivable to bring a rich, smoky 
(Spanish) flavor profile to your palate. You could use it in so many ways, adding it to whatever might 
be enhanced by its smokiness, such as meats, potatoes, eggs, and dressings. I pour it over a batch 
of chickpeas, out of the can and rinsed. I add olive oil and salt and toss ’em into the toaster oven at 
425 for just long enough to get it slightly crisp on the outside, but still soft and chewy inside, about 
10–12 minutes. These things disappear before dinner and, for what it’s worth, I hear they’re good for 
you, too.
3. Herbes de Provence.  Don’t let the fancy French name fool you; you can buy a bottle of it at most 
supermarkets, and the stuff rocks. Why? Because Provence is in the southwest of France, home 
to some of the most delicious food in the entire world, mainly due to its locally grown ingredients. 
In the case of herbs, that translates into rosemary, fennel, thyme, savory, basil, lavender, chervil, 
and marjoram. It’s fantastic, actually, because rather than having to measure and shake out eight 
different bottles into your recipe, you can have it properly blended and ready to go from just one. 
How to use? We love its flavor on roast chicken, potatoes, and added into the morning eggs. Use it on 
fish and vegetables, to fancify your vinaigrette, or on anything you wish to grace with a breath of the 
French countryside. I think you’ll be happy.Short Order Dad
44Other Seasoning
There are other “seasonings” 
aside from the saline (salty) ones. 
And there are many ways to 
incorporate their varied flavors and 
accents into cooking. There are 
the acids (vinegar and citrus, for 
example), hot seasoning (peppers, 
peppercorns, and the likes), and 
saccharine seasonings (such 
as sugar and honey, common in 
baking). There are also plenty 
of condiments, from mustards 
and horseradish to ketchup and 
Worcestershire, and flavorful fats 
(infused oils) that you will use to 
excite your palate.
8. BOILING, BLANCHING, and 
POACHING
These three methods all involve 
cooking that uses the action of 
liquid, most often water. They 
all require that ingredients are 
submerged in the water. The 
difference between the three is 
the intensity of the boil and the 
duration of the cooking. Boiling, as 
we remember from grade school, 
is when fresh water (at sea level) 
is heated to 212 degrees. When 
it becomes very vigorous, cooks 
call it a rolling boil. When very 
gently bubbling, it is referred to 
as simmering. Blanching is the 
use of boiling water to prepare 
foods, usually vegetables, often before cooking them further 
by another method. Blanching 
is a quick process; you’re not 
looking to cook something to 
death, but rather to remove its 
firm rawness, and in the case of 
green vegetables in particular, to 
maintain its vibrant greenness 
(which actually requires that you 
place your blanched veggies into 
a bowl of ice water in a process 
called “shocking”). For instance, 
you might briefly blanch broccoli 
to soften it before sautéing it olive 
oil. Poaching is the process of 
gently cooking food in simmering 
liquid (whether water, stock, milk, 
wine, etc.) For example, you might 
poach pears in water and sugar 
(or red wine) to make a simple, 
sweet dessert (see page 213).
Boiling  can be used to cook 
most anything. It is a particularly 
efficient way to cook firm or hearty 
food such as meats, potatoes, 
shrimp, chicken, vegetables, 
beans, and even peanuts. And of 
course, there’s no other way to 
cook pasta. The challenge with 
cooking in boiling water is that 
you can overdo it, in which case 
you end up with limp, soggy, and 
tasteless. You can boil the taste 
right out of food and destroy its 
texture. Pasta, for example, is 
ideal when al dente, meaning that it still has a little bit of a chew to it. 
No one really wants noodles that 
are slimy and gummy.
Poaching,  on the other hand, 
is a delicate cooking method, 
which is why it is most commonly 
associated with eggs and salmon. 
If you tried cooking soft-fleshed 
fish in boiling water, it would 
disintegrate. But when you’re 
looking for that perfect runny 
yellow yoke for your eggs benny, 
poaching is the way to play. And 
if you’re really feeling decadent 
(or very thin, or very rich) you can 
even poach in butter or olive oil.
Court-Bouillon
In cooking school, they call it 
a Court-Bouillon  (core-boo-
yone). To me, it’s basically 
highly flavored water that 
you’d use to poach fish or 
vegetables. It’s an effective 
way to bring fresh flavor 
to light food. You’d simply 
infuse water with some 
combination of aromatics 
(garlic, onion, etc.), herbs, 
and perhaps wine or vinegar. 
Boil and reduce to a simmer 
and you’ve got yourself a 
tasty broth to cook with.45
Let’s Talk Technique: 10 FundamentalsThe beauty of blanching is that it’s 
simple, fast, and effective. Try it 
with some nice fresh string beans: 
place them in a well-salted pot 
of boiling water until they soften 
a little, but still maintain some 
crunchiness. Immediately strain 
them into a bowl filled with water 
and ice. By shocking them, you 
will notice that their color stays a 
vibrant green. Now, go ahead and 
give them a quick sauté in butter 
or in olive oil, drop in a handful of 
sliced almonds, and you’ve just 
made string beans almondine. 
But if you want to get lucky, call it 
by its fancy French name, haricots 
verts aux amandes.
What about steaming? Another 
way to cook with boiling liquid, but 
the food is not actually submerged 
in it. But be very careful: steam 
can be as hot as boiling water.
9. FRYING
Frying is, quite simply, cooking 
food in oil or fat. It is one of the 
oldest cooking methods known 
to man. Although almost every 
culture has its version of fabulous 
fried food—tempura in Japan, fish 
and chips in England, schnitzel 
in Germany, Italy’s fritto misto , 
Israeli falafel—America is the 
reigning Super Bowl champion of frying. And with good reason: 
it’s what makes everything from 
French fries to fried chicken 
taste so damn good! When you 
consider the popularity of the 
frying method, it even transcends 
meat and potatoes and goes right 
into dessert as well. Beignets in 
New Orleans, zeppoles and funnel 
cakes at street and county fairs, 
and doughnuts sold on almost 
every main street in America are, 
of course, all versions of deep-
fried dough.
There are various forms of 
frying, of which deep-frying and 
panfrying are the most widely 
used. Frying methods basically 
differ based on the amount of fat 
required as well as the vessel in 
which the food is fried. Whichever 
the method, cooking in very hot 
fat produces both an amazing 
taste and texture. Frying is not 
the easiest technique to master 
due to the number of variables 
involved—i.e., types of fats, 
different methods, and cooking 
times. However, when done well, 
frying gives you everything you 
want from food. It gives you the 
taste (from caramelization) and 
it gives you the texture, that is, 
crispy on the outside, yet soft and 
fluffy on the inside in the case of a doughnut, or juicy on the inside 
in the case of fried chicken. (I 
suppose you could also add gooey 
inside in the case of the deep-fried 
Three Musketeers bar.) Frying 
is why we love foods like French 
fries, clams, shrimp, onion rings, 
Chinese egg rolls, calamari, green 
tomatoes, and hush puppies so 
much. Oh, and don’t forget potato 
chips and tortilla chips, too!
Deep-frying is exactly what it 
sounds like—ingredients are 
totally immersed in hot oil. 
Think French fries at Mickey 
D’s. Obviously this method uses 
the most oil because the food 
is completely surrounded by 
it. It is an ideal method to cook 
potatoes, chicken, and foods 
that are “battered” or “breaded,” 
like seafood (clams and shrimp) 
and vegetables (eggplant or 
artichokes). When deep-frying 
is done right, you end up with 
crispness, of course, not soggy 
and leaden from oil. Panfrying is 
different because you use enough 
oil to cover about a third to half 
of the ingredient you’re cooking. 
With this method, you cook one 
side of an item first, usually in 
some type of frying pan, and then 
it’s turned over to cook on the 
other side. Panfrying is ideal for Short Order Dad
46ingredients like pork chops and 
certain fish because it leads to 
really nice browning of the food. 
Stir-frying is a third frying method 
worth mentioning just briefly. It is 
a useful technique that’s actually 
very similar to sautéing, but based 
on Chinese wok cooking, which 
employs a rounded pan to stir and 
toss finely chopped food over high 
heat for quick cooking. It uses just 
enough oil to provide sufficient 
lubrication and it requires that 
the ingredients are moved around 
continuously around the pan. 
That’s what a wok was built for, to 
facilitate the perpetual motion of 
ingredients over high heat to get 
them just cooked and crisp. When 
you think of Chinese food, you 
can understand how stir-frying 
would be effective for anything 
from thinly sliced proteins like 
meat, chicken, and seafood to 
vegetables and even (fried) rice.
Because all frying methods 
employ fats in varying amounts, 
let’s cover some of the basics 
about fats. As you know, there 
are many different types of oils, 
such as olive, vegetable, corn, 
peanut, canola, and safflower, 
to name just a few. Different oils 
impart different flavors and have 
different smoke points, which simply means they smoke up at 
different temperatures. Therefore, 
certain oils are better for certain 
uses. Whereas olive oil might be 
fine for light sautéing or low heat 
cooking, peanut oil, vegetable oil, 
and sunflower oil are better for 
high-heat frying. Also, olive oil 
adds a lot of flavor to foods, so it would be wonderful when frying 
artichokes, for example. Canola 
oil, on the other hand, is neutral, 
and is preferred when the item 
being fried would not benefit 
from the taste of the oil, such as 
doughnuts. As mentioned before, 
you can also fry in “clarified” 
butter (see sidebar on Clarified 
Butter) and lard (animal fat), 
which produces some great taste 
and texture, but is generally 
frowned upon for reasons of 
health.
What about health? You’ve all 
heard about good oil and bad 
oil. Hydrogenated oil clogs the 
arteries, so you want to avoid 
those. Oils such as olive oil, 
canola, and other plant-based oils 
are said to be heart healthier. A 
lot has been said about horrors 
of frying food and in this country, 
and we do have the tendency to 
overdo it. But that doesn’t mean 
we can’t enjoy French fries every 
once in a while. Unless you want 
to die young I wouldn’t advocate 
deep-frying at every meal. But 
I certainly wouldn’t advocate 
avoiding it altogether because it 
also adds immeasurably to quality 
of life. I mean, what’s life without 
French fries? Or fried chicken? Or 
doughnuts?How to Tell When Oil 
Is Hot Enough to Fry
If you don’t have a 
thermometer designed 
specifically for oil, here are 
three tricks to see if the oil 
is at the right temperature 
to fry:
1. Place the handle of a 
wooden spoon, or a 
chopstick, into the oil 
and watch for bubbles 
to collect around it.
2. Drop an unpopped 
popcorn kernel into 
the oil. It will pop 
when the oil is at the 
right temperature to 
deep-fry.
3. Put a cube of bread in 
the oil. When it sizzles, 
it’s ready. 47
Let’s Talk Technique: 10 FundamentalsSo go ahead and fry, baby, fry! In 
moderation.
10. BAKING
They taught us baking in cooking 
school. I don’t remember getting a 
particularly good grade. Because I 
didn’t. Although I prefer the intuitive 
nature, spontaneity, and the flames 
that constitute savory cooking, I can 
also attest to the fact that baking is 
a beautiful thing. So if you get into 
cooking, you might find yourself 
interested in baking, too. I’m pretty 
positive that fresh baked cookies 
are superior to store-bought. 
(Although I’m not as certain they’re 
always as good as bakery bought.)
Compared to cooking, baking is 
a totally different animal. (Well, 
actually, there’s no animal involved 
at all, unless you count animal 
crackers or elephant ears.) 
Why? Because baking is very 
much about science. Specifically, 
chemistry. As such, one aspect that 
sets it apart is specificity. Whereas 
most of the recipes I present here 
leave room for improvisation, 
variation, and seasoning options, 
baking is characterized by more 
exact measurements and timing. 
I mean that breads and cakes 
don’t rise to the occasion, literally, 
if you haven’t used the precise ingredients, measurements, and 
proportions called for by a recipe. 
I would also contend that for the 
most part, not only is baking more 
methodical and disciplined, it is 
generally more time-consuming 
and leaves more to clean up. As 
you might realize by now, those are 
not a few of my favorite things. But 
they do lend themselves to a lovely 
weekend activity. And baking is 
great to do with kids.
Baking also requires an entirely 
different set of skills, techniques, 
tools, and ingredients.
As for tools, among some others, 
you’d probably want to have 
baking pans, electric mixers, 
mixing bowls, a rolling pin, and a 
pastry brush available. (Of course 
you’ll need measuring cups and 
spoons, but you should have 
those anyway.) Some of the more 
common ingredients you’ll find 
listed in baking recipes include 
eggs and extracts, various baking 
flours and powders, alternative 
sweeteners and fats. The array of 
spices you would likely encounter 
include allspice, cardamom, 
cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and 
nutmeg. And don’t forget a whole 
mess of chocolate, I hope.Even the terminology used in 
baking is different. Perhaps even 
a little kinky. I’m not referring 
to weighing, sifting, folding, 
and decorating. Baking is filled 
with words that seem to run the 
gamut from sexy to downright 
dangerous. Greasing. Kneading. 
Melting. Piping. Whipping. And 
Creaming. I can’t tell if they’re 
making a cake or a porn movie.
I can’t tell if they’re 
making a cake or a 
porn movie.
Although it’s not my preferred 
technique, I know some dudes 
who love it. There is no question 
that baking your own bread from 
scratch and watching it transform 
into a piping hot, crusty, chewy loaf 
of goodness is not only a thrill, it is 
really good eating. And you might 
already know how gratifying it is to 
call those brownies you make for 
the bake sale “homemade.” Just 
because I’m not as turned on by 
parchment paper, pastry bags, and 
pie weights as I am by fire, filets, 
and frankfurters, doesn’t mean 
you might not be. In fact, in the 
chapter on Sweet Things you’ll find 
a few of the simple items I bake 
and that you might want to attempt 
as well.49
The Thing about Recipes  (and How to Look at Them)CHAPTER FIVE
The Thing about Recipes  
(and How to Look at Them)
One of the first things you learn 
when you cook for a while is 
that recipes are necessary and 
important, yet not always perfect or 
flawless. Nor will they all be to your 
liking, either. Our taste buds are 
different. What one person finds too 
salty, another may perceive as not 
seasoned enough. Naturally, the 
same goes for too oily, too spicy, 
and too anything, for that matter. 
That comes with the territory.
Judy Rodgers was an influential 
American chef who was quoted 
as saying, “Recipes do not make 
food taste good, people do.” It’s 
true that two people can follow 
the exact same recipe in the same 
way and end up with completely 
different results. It’s also the case 
that the quality of the ingredients 
you begin with have a significant 
impact on the final product. 
Fresher produce will almost 
always be superior to canned. 
Better meat makes a better burger. Higher quality oil matters. 
And so on. That holds true for 
almost any ingredient at all. Which 
is why I’ve always advocated . . .
Get the best 
ingredients you can . . . 
and don’t mess ’em up 
too much.
That experience of writing this 
book was invaluable because 
it reminded me how much I 
like making food and feeding 
my people. And eating what 
I’ve made. There is not one 
recipe included that I wouldn’t 
be happy to cook again. It also 
served as a reminder of the 
inherent limitations of recipes. 
Recipes are guides, not unlike 
maps. They provide directions 
to a destination—however, that 
doesn’t mean it’s the only way to 
get there. Even your GPS gives 
you options. As you follow the directions and ingredient list I 
provide here, remember that 
nothing is more important than 
how something tastes to you and 
the people you’re cooking for. 
Which is why it’s so important, 
whenever possible, to taste what 
you’re making at each step of 
the process along the way . It’s 
why most recipes, from time 
immemorial, always include 
some version of the words “taste 
for seasoning” and directions to 
“adjust to taste” accordingly.
The process of writing this book 
also recalled something I was 
taught in cooking school by 
my excellent teacher, James 
Peterson, who himself went on to 
write extraordinary cookbooks, 
including Sauces , considered to 
be the “bible” on the subject. He 
taught that you read through a 
recipe to glean basic information. 
What will the cooking method 
be? A sauté, a braise, or a roast, 
Short Order Dad
50for example. How much time 
will be involved? To shop for it, 
to prep, to cook. And of course, 
what are the key ingredients? 
To that he added the question 
of what, if any, substitutions or 
alterations we’d be making. The 
recipe was a starting point, but 
no savory recipe was necessarily 
considered to be entirely set in 
stone. There is usually some room 
for adjustment, refinement, and/
or adaptation. Admittedly, there are 
certain recipes that do require a 
stricter adherence to the formula, 
especially when it comes to the 
more precise measurements and 
specific ingredients used in baking.
There are other considerations 
that affect recipe results. My oven 
is likely calibrated at a different 
temperature from yours. My pans 
might not distribute the heat from 
a flame the same way yours do. 
Or we have a different perception 
of what “medium high” heat looks 
like. Especially if you’re using 
electric and I have a gas flame. 
Or we’re cooking at different 
altitudes. Or rather than being at 
room temperature, maybe your leg 
of lamb was still quite cold on the 
inside when you put it in the oven. 
Any of which means that foods 
might not cook for exactly the same amount of time indicated. 
That’s why you see estimated 
cooking times in recipes.
When it comes to measurements, 
my large lemon  might release a 
whole lot more juice than your little 
one. Or my medium onion  may not 
be the same size as yours. And 
just what constitutes a “handful,” 
especially if our hands are different 
sizes? In these cases, I’ll always try 
to include a measurement that does 
the job (e.g., 1 teaspoon lemon juice, 
¼ cup onion) for the sake of clarity 
and consistency. But as you can see, 
there is often some wiggle room.
You should also understand the 
role of substitutions. If you, your 
family, or your friends absolutely 
detest cilantro, for example, 
simply remove it from a recipe. 
Better yet, as herbs are generally 
interchangeable, replace it with 
another fresh herb you prefer. 
If you’re sensitive to salt, use 
less than what’s called for, and 
consider readily available salt 
substitutes. You’re not a garlic 
lover? Don’t sweat it. Use onion, 
shallot, or leek instead.
What about the number of 
servings? Recipes usually indicate 
how many portions they make. That would be fine if there was 
one standard serving size for 
every type of food that we all 
agreed upon. But I’m guessing 
that my dainty daughters don’t 
consume the same humongous 
portions as your sons who play on 
the varsity football squad. So that 
rack of ribs that I suggest serves 
two could probably serve one very 
hungry eater. Or feed four folks if 
presented as an appetizer instead.
Recipes are your road map. 
Over time, and with a little 
experience, you will become an 
expert navigator. Most recipes 
are somewhat forgiving and 
flexibility is fine. So if something 
tastes better to you a certain 
way, go for it. As I said from the 
beginning, the idea is for you to 
find the dishes that you can not 
only master, but even go ahead 
and make your own. And unless 
you’re being paid to make the 
meal, don’t be afraid to make 
mistakes.
No Stylists Were 
Harmed In The 
Making Of This Book
To prepare for the book’s 
photography, I made all one 51
The Thing about Recipes (and How to Look at Them) hundred recipes over nine days. I 
had no help in the kitchen. I did  
all the cutting, chopping, cooking, 
and plating myself. So . . . no 
stylists were harmed in the 
making of this book. To be fair, 
however, my ace photographer 
Josephine Rozman (Jo Ro) has 
both a great eye and a wonderful 
aesthetic, so I’m sure the plates 
you see pictured here do look 
better than they would if you 
came over to my place for dinner 
on an average evening. Jo and I 
decided on how to best present 
the food—using my own plates, 
by the way—and all the photos 
were shot in my living room, using 
only natural light. Even though 
I’ve never been big on “plating,” as 
they call it (I’m much more about 
the taste than the look of the food), 
I did it this way not only to be 
cost-efficient (i.e., cheap), but so 
that readers could see what these 
dishes should look like without 
relying on experts, stylists, studio 
lighting, and retouching to make 
them look perfect.
A Note on Intuitive Cooking
Note to my fellow males: It 
has long been a historical 
generalization or perhaps a truism 
than men don’t like maps or 
following directions. Although that might not be true, it is true for me. 
Which is to say that I will glance 
at a recipe to get a basic idea of 
what’s required, then I’ll go off and 
make it my own way. Indeed, much 
of what I make these days is what 
I call “intuitive” cooking. By that I 
mean that I might survey a recipe, 
see a concept I like, and apply 
those principles to ingredients I 
already have on hand or those that 
look good at the market on that 
day. Intuitive cooking also applies 
to making substitutions in recipes. 
So if you’re making biscotti with a 
recipe that calls for dried cherries 
(page 225) then of course you can 
use other dried fruit in its place. 
Unless almonds, for example, are 
absolutely mandatory to a recipe’s 
final result, feel free to substitute 
other nuts with a similar (hard) 
texture. You’ll see a few recipes 
here marked “intuitive” that are 
especially good and easy to adapt. 
That’s my way of inviting you to use 
your intuition.
Since I’m very big on taking 
advantage of whatever leftovers 
I have on hand, intuitive cooking 
comes into play regularly. My eggs 
puttanesca (page 63) is a creation 
based on the Italian pasta dish 
of the same name, but adapted 
instead for breakfast. My oatmeal brûlée (page 71) was born out of 
that delicious crack of caramelized 
sugar atop the classic French 
dessert crème brûlée. I’ll admit 
that intuitive cooking comes 
more naturally once you’ve had 
more experience in the kitchen. 
Therein lies the intention behind 
this book. Take what I’ve learned, 
practice it yourself, and feel free 
to use your own intuition as you 
see fit. Let the recipes serve as a 
guide, of course. But once you’re 
comfortable with some of the 
basics, have at it. Worst case is 
that you’ll mess it up, learn how 
not to do it, and order that pizza 
instead.
P .S. Just try not to experiment 
too much when using expensive 
ingredients. Remember . . .
“Mess up oatmeal, not 
veal.”
Salt.  All recipes included here 
assume kosher salt. Not only is 
it easier to apply by hand, but 
iodized table salt can have a 
slightly bitter taste. That’s why 
many chefs cook with coarse 
kosher salt rather than table 
salt. For a few bucks a box, you 
should too. Kosher salt grains 
are larger than table salt, so be Short Order Dad
52aware that measurements have 
to be adjusted if you use table 
salt. (Use less volume indicated 
in the recipe.) Of course, if you’re 
sensitive to salt, use less. You 
can always add. And remember 
to season at each stage of the 
cooking process, rather than just 
at the end.
Oil. You will find many recipes 
that call for oil, sometimes to cook 
with, other times to add atop a 
finished dish. Here’s a general 
rule I follow: When the oil is a 
key component of a dish, by all 
means, use the best quality olive 
oil you can. For cooking with oil, 
as mentioned previously, olive is 
fine for quick sautés, whereas 
the neutral oils are better for high 
heat cooking and frying.
Herbs and spices . Some people 
despise cumin, others can’t tolerate 
garlic. Cilantro is another of those 
polarizing herbs that certain folks hate. So by all means skip it— not 
the recipe —and use parsley or 
some other herb instead. Disliking 
a single ingredient doesn’t 
preclude you from making that 
dish. (Although I’d argue that 
guacamole without cilantro is not 
guacamole.) Naturally, this holds 
true for any herbs or spices you 
simply can’t stand. There is always 
an alternative.
Keeping It Clean
Chefs know that it’s easy to add 
taste appeal by using plenty of fat 
and salt. Most of my recipes try to 
be conscious about calories. There 
is no deep-frying; there’s not too 
much cream, mayo, or butter. I try 
not to use too much salt or sugar. 
I’m not being preachy. I’m not 
advocating for the abstemious. I’m 
merely exercising some restraint 
so as to minimize unnecessary 
caloric intake while still ensuring 
the food tastes great.The Taste-to-Effort Equation
The most taste with the fewest 
ingredients and the least effort ™. 
It all starts with the recipe, which 
indicates how many ingredients 
you’ll need, how many steps it 
will take, how much time you’ll 
need, and the overall degree of 
difficulty involved. In fact, I’ve 
developed my own kind of internal 
measuring system. It’s somewhat 
imprecise, but the idea is clear: 
some dishes are worth the effort, 
others are simply not. Here’s an 
example: littleneck clams on the 
grill. You throw some clams on 
the grill, close the lid, and when 
the clams open—having steamed 
in their own salty juices—they 
are ready to eat. Voilà! And I’ve 
had people ask me for the recipe. 
Quite simply, perhaps one of the 
greatest single-ingredient dishes 
in the world . . . unless firing up a 
grill is considered too much effort.
The Taste-to-Effort Equation
 Low effort, Big Taste Lotta effort, Big Taste
 Totally worth it Not worth it  
   (unless someone else is making it)53
The Thing about Recipes (and How to Look at Them) When I see a recipe with so many 
ingredients my eyes start to glaze 
over, I lose interest. That said, 
there are some recipes with only 
a few ingredients that can still be 
complicated to prepare. One such 
I’ve included here is the Serious 
Chocolate Cake (page 232). Melting 
chocolate is easy, but whipping 
eggs over heat until they reach the 
right thickness is a technique that 
requires a certain level of knowhow 
and patience. Then there’s folding, 
greasing, water baths . . . etc. 
Doable, but not necessarily simple. 
The result, however, is an intense 
and decadent chocolate cake, made 
without flour, that I think is worth 
doing.
I hope it’s obvious that I’ve only 
included recipes that are worth the effort. I’ve seen plenty of 
recipes that I’d never bother 
making. Not because I don’t 
like the dish. But because, why 
bother? Like mango chutney. 
Too many ingredients. Too 
complicated. Too much time. And 
perfectly excellent from that jar 
in the supermarket. That is not 
the case with tomato sauce or 
vinaigrette, both of which I urge 
you to make rather than purchase.
RESULTS MAY VARY
Never have truer words been 
spoken, particularly when it 
comes to recipes. One of the 
things you learn from experience 
along the way is that two people 
may follow the same recipe in 
the same way, using the same 
specifications called for, and end up with different results. And 
not due to their level of skill, 
either, but to some of the factors I 
mentioned earlier. But mostly the 
ingredients themselves. Brilliant 
local tomatoes from a farm stand 
at their peak of perfect ripeness 
will beat off-season store-bought 
ones all the time, especially for 
recipes where tomatoes are a 
central ingredient. Remember, 
the recipe is your starting point 
and most helpful guide. You will 
get the optimal results by using 
ingredients when they’re at their 
best.

This has become increasingly popular everywhere you look, and with good reason. Avocado is nutritious, 
creamy, and delicious. Kids and grownups alike love it, whether in guacamole or, in this case, on a slice of toast. 
The key is to get a nice ripe avocado, one that yields a bit to the touch when you apply pressure to it. You can 
keep it simple with just a sprinkle of salt, or add pistachios, a slice of tomato, red pepper flakes if you like a little 
spice, a slice of turkey or prosciutto for added protein, or anything else that delights you. Whatever you do, don’t 
tell the kids it’s loaded with health.

I just inhaled one myself. Extremely appetizing and satisfying, it’s essentially scrambled eggs mixed with a few other zesty 
ingredients wrapped inside a soft flour tortilla. Cheese seems like a must, maybe a few veggies, and perhaps a breakfast 
meat. No one wants to spend a ton of time cooking in the morning, so the trick is to use what’s on hand and pretty much 
ready to go without a lot of prep. For example, already shredded or sliced cheese is an obvious time-saver. Nothing wrong 
with last night’s leftovers, chopped up, whether vegetables, potatoes, or whatever. This is all about variations; you decide 
what makes it “super” in yours. That soft tortilla filled with a splendid mélange of your favorite breakfast foods is a great way 
to start the day and a delight to eat.
Note:  I like to “toast” the tortilla for a few seconds over an open flame to add a little blast of char to taste, but it’s not at all 
necessary.
Something just occurred to me: If you happen to have any salami on hand, you might chop and toss some right into the 
hot pan as your starting point. There was a famous old Catskills comedian by the name of Alan King who co-wrote a book 
entitled, Is Salami and Eggs Better Than Sex?  Just thought you should know.

This dish is inspired by the famed Italian spaghetti alla puttanesca , which, to be frank, translates into whore-style spaghetti . 
Long story. You might not want to mention that to the kids, either. In any case, it’s a way of bringing a ton of flavor—AND any 
leftover pasta from the night before—to the morning’s eggs. I’ve eliminated the garlic and anchovies that would normally 
go into the pasta version; this is breakfast, after all. But you won’t miss them. It’s that good. As always, feel free to throw in 
whatever other sensible scraps you might find in the fridge—that is the very nature of this whore’s dish.
Short Order Dad
64At some point, my kids 
starting requesting a 
smoothie every day at breakfast. 
From their perspective, it was 
about being sweet and delicious. 
From mine, it was an ideal way to 
get a whole lot of fruit into their 
bellies. The trick is to be able to 
do that without adding a bunch of 
unnecessary sugar. All you need 
is a blender. There are literally 
millions of possible combinations 
and permutations, so allow your 
own preferences to guide your 
experimentation.
Here are some suggestions from 
my experience.
1. You’re going to need 
some kind of liquid to 
blend everything together 
harmoniously. (Unless you 
have one of those super-
duper blenders that can 
make ANYTHING, including 
marbles, smooth.) Or UNLESS you use a fruit that 
liquefies immediately. Case 
in point: watermelon, which 
I’ve been using a lot these 
days for that very reason. 
The advantage of using 
watermelon is that it exudes 
so much liquid that I don’t 
have to add any juice at all—
which almost always contains 
sugar—before I blend in, say, 
a handful of frozen fruit. (One 
to two cups of watermelon 
provide plenty of juice, by the 
way.)
2. Your liquid of choice can be 
any juice, some form of milk 
(regular, almond, coconut, 
soy, etc.), or even water can 
be used. About 4 ounces per 
smoothie will usually suffice.
3. Fresh fruit or frozen works 
equally well. One advantage 
of the frozen option is that 
the fruit is ready to go, so you don’t need to rinse, peel, and 
cut it. Just plop it right into the 
blender. I like to use frozen 
berries, peaches, pineapple, 
and especially a handful of 
cherries. (With berries, at 
some point you’ll notice seeds 
stuck in your teeth. You could 
strain—I don’t—or floss 
instead.)
4. Can you add veggies? Of 
course. Avocado works, and 
adds a creamy thickness; 
most greens work, too, but 
they can be a little bitter, 
which needs to be balanced 
by the sweetness of the fruit. 
So if you include kale, for 
example, try compensating 
with frozen cherries.
5. What about yogurt? For 
sure. Not only for health and 
creaminess, but also to offset 
the natural sweetness from 
the fruit.Killer Fruit Smoothies:  
10 Things to Know65
Wake Up, It’s a Beautiful Morning6. How about peanut butter? You 
know it. Or almond butter. Not 
so much with fruit juice, but 
ideal when using the milks.
7. Speaking of sweetness and 
peanut butter, when we feel 
like something other than 
fruit only I make a smoothie 
with (unsweetened) almond 
milk, peanut butter, cocoa 
powder, and banana. It’s 
awesome, but I find that it 
still needs a hit of sweetness, 
so I add a spoonful of agave 
syrup. Honey would be fine 
as well. But try it as is first because it might be sweet 
enough for your taste.
8. Ice is fine to add, too, 
especially when you’re not 
using frozen fruit. No one 
wants a hot smoothie.
9. Pro tip: When you do go “all 
fruit,” a squeeze of lemon 
or lime juice actually works 
to accentuate the fruit’s 
sweetness.
10. Turns out there were only 
nine things. (Unless you 
count the idea that most every fruit-based smoothie is also 
conveniently converted into 
an adult beverage with the 
inclusion of vodka, rum, or 
tequila. This is strictly FYI; 
I’m certainly not advocating 
it for breakfast anyway. If 
interested, however, know 
that you might have to adjust 
the citrus/sweet balance 
with either fresh lemon or 
lime juice and your preferred 
sweetening agent.)Short Order Dad
66
Frittata (intuitive)
Frittata is the funky and fanciful name for an omelet-like dish filled with savory tidbits and baked so that it 
becomes like a quiche without a crust. Aside from its deliciousness, the best part for me is the number of 
variations possible, allowing you to use leftovers and/or other remnants you might find in the fridge. That 
includes virtually any kind of vegetable, potato, meats, cheeses, and herbs. As such, this is an “intuitive” dish 
in which eggs become the palette for your imagination. You can use leeks, mushrooms, asparagus, prosciutto, 
rice, goat cheese, salmon, potato, jarred red peppers . . . almost anything you have goes. (You can even use 
leftover pasta for your frittata di pasta !) The only caveat is not to overload it with too many goodies—five at the 
most—and, as always, don’t overcook it, either. You want it to be a little fluffy rather than dried out. By the way, 
it’s good for any mealtime, either hot or at room temp.
Notes:
1. Use an oven-safe pan that you can transfer from the top of the stove into oven. And remember that the larger the pan, 
the thinner the frittata, and the more quickly it will cook.67
Wake Up, It’s a Beautiful Morning2. My basic recipe follows, but I repeat: make it yours. The thing to know is that I like using all already cooked ingredients 
because it’s quicker and easier. However, if you choose to use raw ingredients (like bacon or sausage) you must cook 
them first and then remove from the pan to add back in later.
3. About the cheese: you can opt for different types of cheese depending on the texture you prefer. Cheddar and jack melt 
well; goat, feta, or ricotta make a creamy frittata; Parmesan offers a lot of taste, but neither meltability nor creaminess. 
You can surely use more than one type, and you can even put some on top of the frittata and finish it under the broiler 
for a minute or so to get a cheesy, crispy top.

OPTIONAL: ½ TEASPOON HERB OR SPICE OF YOUR 
CHOICE (E.G. OREGANO, CHILI POWDER, ETC.)
½ TEASPOON SALT, OR TO TASTE, AND PEPPER
PREPARATION
1. Pre-heat the oven to 400°F .
2. Lightly beat together eggs with the milk 
(if using) and salt and pepper. Stir in the 
grated cheese and set aside.
3. In a 10–12 inch ovenproof skillet, melt 
butter or oil over medium-high heat. 
Add the onions and peppers and cook for several minutes, stirring frequently, 
until soft and beginning to brown. Spoon 
in diced potato and bacon, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, stirring all together for a 
couple of minutes until everything is hot.
4. Evenly distribute ingredients across bottom 
of the pan and pour in the egg mixture, 
distributing it to coat everything. Cook on 
the burner for about a minute or until you 
see the edges begin to set, i.e., look like 
they’re beginning to get a little firm. Then 
insert the skillet into the oven and keep an 
eye on it, watching for it to get somewhat 
firm, but don’t let it get too brown . That 
might take about 8–12 minutes or so, 
depending on size and thickness. When it 
seems to be almost fully cooked, you can 
sprinkle cheese on top and place it under 
the broiler for just a minute.
5. Carefully remove the frittata from the 
skillet with the help of a spatula, onto 
a cutting board . . . or cut wedges out 
of the pan. But whatever you do, don’t 
scratch that pan!
As mentioned, this stuff is good nice and hot, and perfectly fine at room temperature, too, even days later if you keep it in the 
refrigerator.69

Wake Up, It’s a Beautiful MorningINGREDIENTS
1½ TABLESPOONS BUTTER
4 SLICES OF PINEAPPLE CUT INTO ROUNDS (CORE 
REMOVED)
1½ TABLESPOONS SUGAR
PANCAKE BATTER FOR 4 PANCAKESPREPARATION
1.  Melt butter in a big ol’ pan that you can 
put in the oven, like cast-iron. Lay down 
the pineapple in a single layer. Sprinkle 
with sugar. Let cook over medium heat 
for a couple of minutes, until you smell 
greatness. Pour favorite pancake batter 
over the top. Place in 375°F oven for 
10–12 minutes until it’s puffy, browned, 
and caramelized underneath.
2.  Remove carefully and top it with real 
maple syrup, maybe a hit of powdered 
sugar. Feed people. Notice joy.Pineapple Upside-Down Pancakes
More of weekend thing, but this is a big hit. The nice part is that you can either use fresh pineapple and your 
own pancake mix made from scratch OR use pineapple slices right out of the can and pancake mix from a box. 
(Like I did. Just as good.) Either way, take my word on this: it’s really hard not to like pineapple slices that have 
been caramelized/candied and incorporated into pancakes. You can make these individually or, if you’re serving 
a few folks, I’d suggest making one big pancake in a pan that can go in the oven . . . and have enough to serve 
four people. Don’t fret if you make more than you need; it’s fine the next day, even cold.

It Ain’t Stuffed, Either
Truth be told, I don’t make this often, but when I do I’m always blown away by how good it is. Then again, what 
could possibly be bad about combining creamy peanut butter with the sweet, fluffy goodness of French toast? 
Nothing. There’s more than one way to do it, and as you know by now, I’m opting for the less complicated. That 
means that instead of stuffing two slices of bread with peanut butter, you blend the peanut butter directly into 
the egg mixture, drop in a couple of other flavor accents, and then soak your bread and cook it up as you always 
would. This stuff rocks!

Apps and Snacks (Good for the Kids or Great for the Date)Go-to Guacamole
You MUST make your own guacamole. It will be 100 times better and fresher than what you can find already prepared in a 
grocery store. And you get to decide precisely how you like it. Smooth or chunky. Spicy or not. With or without other added 
ingredients, like tomatoes, for example.
Some things to know:
1. I am not a proponent of tomato in guacamole, a commonly added ingredient. For one thing, the star of this dish is 
obviously the avocado, and to me anyway, tomato detracts from that. For another, one of the great Mexican chefs I know 
(Betty Vasquez) told me, “Never add tomatoes.” That’s good enough for me.
2. As for the onion, you can use it as is, or you can give your chopped onion a quick rinse under cold water—then dry 
well—if you’d like to take some of the “bite” out of it.
3. My personal preference is a serrano chile pepper to a jalapeño because it’s a little bit hotter and fruitier, but jalapeño is 
perfectly fine. And don’t worry about the seeds so much; most of the spicy heat actually comes from the white pith (or 
“ribs”) of the pepper. (By the way, in case you don’t know: when you cut hot pepper,  keep your hands away from your 
eyes.  Wash hands well, wear gloves, do whatever it takes . . . but realize that if you accidentally rub your eyes while you 
have pepper on your fingers, plan on crying for the next hour.)
4. Don’t overdo the lime juice. People have a tendency to go too heavy with it. Start with a little, taste, and you can always 
add more. Same with salt.
5. Of course you can buy tortilla chips, BUT, here’s an option to consider: buy a package of corn tortillas instead, and put 
them in the oven—let’s say 375ºF—until they’re crispy. There, you’ve made your own!

or so. 
4. Remove them while hot. They’ll get crisp 
and crackling as they cool, so let them 
do that before diving in.Nuts of Glory  
(Roasted, Spiced, and Glazed)
I love a good nut.  Especially one that’s salty and spicy with a hint of sweetness. I will actually choose one 
cocktail bar over another if they offer superior nuts. Who doesn’t want superior nuts?
The concept is simple:  Roasting makes a marked improvement to basic raw nuts. You can even do this in a 
toaster oven. The spice mixture can be blended to your taste specifications. For example, I like chili powder, 
cinnamon, and smoked paprika . . . but you can just as easily use cumin, curry, cayenne, or whatever else 
floats your boat. Just don’t burn the nuts, which I seem to do about 50 percent of the time.
Pro Tip:  Remember that not only does sweet stuff burn easily, it also sticks to the bottom of the pan. So if you 
want an easier cleanup, lay down a sheet of parchment paper in the roasting tray.

1. Lightly rinse livers, remove any fat or 
membranes you see, and slice them into 
separate “lobes.” Pat dry well with paper

medium-high heat, and place the livers 
in one layer without crowding them. 
Cook for 2 minutes on one side until 
they’re browned, then turn them over 
and cook another minute or 2 on the 
other side until browned. Check for 
doneness. They should be slightly pink 
inside.Fry Me a Liver  
(Simply SAUTEED Chicken Livers)
Let’s face it, chicken livers have an image problem. They’re one of those polarizing foods that people either love 
or hate. I’m a lover. (If you know what I mean.) I firmly believe that more people would be enjoying them if they 
were served a little bit pink on the inside rather than being cooked to the point where they taste like, well . . . 
liver. When overcooked, liver becomes metallic and minerally tasting. Again, the key is to know when to pull 
it from the pan. Although that will depend, as always, on the size of the livers and the heat beneath them, my 
suggestion is to cook plump ones for maybe 3–4 minutes on medium high heat and then take one out and check 
for readiness. You’re looking for a well-browned exterior, with just a touch of pink peeking through from the 
inside. Great as a shared appetizer or good for a small meal with couple of eggs or a few tomatoes and slice of 
baguette.

Then you can top it off with any one of a number of options, from the simplest—rubbed with garlic, painted 
with olive oil, a touch of coarse salt—to everything from tomatoes, beans (like that white bean dip on page 83),

You’ve got to try this. Everyone loves pizza and there’s something exciting about making and customizing your 
own. This one’s especially quick, easy, and rewarding. The surprise element is the use of a flour tortilla as 
the “dough.” Why? It uses essentially the same predominant ingredients as a regular pizza dough—flour and 
water—and produces a crackling thin crust. All you really need is some sauce and cheese . . . plus a skillet you 
can stick under the broiler in the oven for a minute to two. Have fun choosing whatever (quick-cooking) toppings 
you love.89
Apps and Snacks (Good for the Kids or Great for the Date)Pizza
If you don’t happen to be into super-thin crust pizza, allow me to suggest this alternative: pick up a 
premade pizza dough, frozen or not. Even better, buy one directly from your neighborhood pizza maker. 
Seriously, if your pizza shop will sell you dough, go for it. If that’s the case, the ingredients above are still 
valid, but the proportion and process will fundamentally change.
If you buy a pizza dough you’ll need to spread it out. You can cook in a baking pan/sheet, or directly 
on a pizza stone or one of those perforated nonstick pizza pans. If it’s the baking pan, lightly lubricate it 
first with oil. Then, using some combination of a rolling pin and your own hands, spread the dough as 
far as possible to the edges of the pan. If you have good dough, it is often quite elastic, which can make it 
challenging to spread. Get the dough to room temperature first , and be patient, but try not to handle the 
dough too much because a) you will tear it and b) it will get tough rather than chewy. And you want chewy. 
So the more you can stretch the dough before you lay it in the pan, the better. I’d pre-bake that dough for 
a few minutes until it starts to firm up. Only a few minutes, and you’ll smell it. Then add the sauce and 
toppings and cook on very high heat until crust is browned, cheese is melted, and toppings are cooked!91

I’ve been making this classic for a while and it’s always a hit with the crowd. Plus, it’s only two ingredients , both 
of which are bought at your local supermarket. Although pigs in blankets are meant to be small, I bake these 
huge, encasing an entire kielbasa in all the dough it takes to envelop it, before cutting it into bite-size pieces

Is this even a recipe? I vacillated over whether or not to include because it seems so obvious and simple that I 
feel a little guilty. Yet . . . when we went to an Italian restaurant not too long ago, this is exactly what they brought 
to the table instead of the usual bread and butter. And you know what? It was so good. Especially for me, 
because I don’t even love cucumbers and don’t include them in my salads. But when you have a good firm one, 
and you remove the seeds (easily accomplished with a spoon), then cut it into nice, large chunks, douse it with 
a good splash of quality olive oil, and sprinkle it with sea salt . . . you have a revelation. One that’s crunchy, tasty, 
and healthy. They’re best good and cold.
*Those long “English” or “hothouse” cucumbers are particularly good for this because their seeds are so small 
they don’t have to be removed. Regular cukes are just as good, but I think better when the seeds are removed. 
So peel them, cut them in half lengthwise, and simply scrape out the seeds using a spoon.97

greens. Maybe some gremolata  (page 
208). Plus a glass of Côtes du Rhône  for

Three ingredients to greatness. (Four if you count pepper. But come on, who’s counting pepper?) You could buy 
lamb on the bone, which is ordinarily the better way to go because bones bring flavor. But I’m going the lazy 
route here by using boneless because I think it’s even less work. In fact, I don’t even bother unrolling the lamb 
and removing anything that looks inedible—fat, sinew, or gristle—which you might do if you’re not too lazy. And 
if you feel like doing another few minutes’ work, and you have some fresh garlic and rosemary on hand, stuff 
’em in there, too.
Note:  This is one of those dishes that’s perfectly scrumptious on its own (see page 96), yet you can always bring 
a little something extra to the table. Literally. Gremolata  (page 208) is an assertive mixture of parsley, lemon 
zest, and garlic, and if you favor big flavor, a little bit of it on top of a nice piece of lamb could be mighty fine.99
Red Meat, Pig, and Poultry (It's all good in small doses)World’s Best Beer-Braised  
Brisket of Beef
This delicious and simple recipe transforms an ordinary piece of meat into an extraordinary meal. And there are 
10 good reasons to do it.
 1. It is easy to make. (And hard to screw up.)
 2. It’s inexpensive.
 3. It requires only one pot.
 4. It produces its own glorious gravy.
 5. It makes your house smell really, really good.
 6. It’s at least as good the next day. (“It makes a nice sandwich.”)
 7. It can feed a lot of people.
 8. It’s an extremely adaptable recipe.
 9. Everyone loves it—kids and grown-ups alike. (Vegetarians, not so much.)
10. Most important, it’s mouthwateringly delicious and fall-off-the-bone tender. And there’s not even a bone.
Yes, my friends: say hello to Beer-Braised Brisket of Beef. The name brisket  itself may not be sexy, but the dish 
is. You need only a few things to proceed:
• Large pot with a tight-fitting lid that’s big enough to house the hunk of meat you’re about to cook. It is 
generally called a stockpot or the more interesting sounding Dutch oven.
• The meat, onions, garlic, some type of tomato product, and beer. Salt, pepper, and oil also come into play.
• A little bit of patience; magnificence can’t be rushed.
Here’s the process, broken down:
The amount of brisket obviously depends on how many eaters; figure about ¾ pound uncooked per person, 
but I’d encourage more because leftovers rock. The onion and garlic add a lot of flavor, so I use plenty of both, 
particularly the onions, which benefit from long cooking to become sweet and soft. By “tomato product” I mean 
some form of canned tomato. It can be whole tomatoes, crushed, pureed, or tomato paste, any of which will add 
color and taste to the mix. Don’t tell anyone, but I’ve also used ketchup successfully.Short Order Dad
100The beer is used to “braise” the meat, which means slow cooking in liquid. With sufficient heat and time, 
the alcohol will cook out of the beer but leave behind a rich flavor. So you might want to splurge on something 
fuller bodied, like an amber beer. But if you prefer to make this without beer, you can easily substitute beef or 
vegetable broth and still achieve delicious results. (Red wine works, too.)
The bit about patience. Once you handle the simple pregame prep, which involves some slicing, seasoning, 
and searing, your brisket becomes like a reluctant starlet who wants to be left alone—at least for a couple of 
hours. But that’s good, too. Life is fast enough; dinner shouldn’t have to be.
Now for the game plan:
SERVES 6
1. GET YOUR INGREDIENTS
1 BEEF BRISKET (ABOUT 3 POUNDS)
2 GARLIC CLOVES, PEELED AND SLICED THIN
1 TABLESPOON SALT AND GROUND BLACK PEPPER TO TASTE
2 TABLESPOONS VEGETABLE OIL
2–3 BOTTLES LAGER OR AMBER BEER (CAN SUBSTITUTE WITH 3–4 CUPS BEEF OR VEGETABLE BROTH)
4 LARGE ONIONS, PEELED AND SLICED
10-OUNCE CAN CRUSHED TOMATOES OR 1 SMALL CAN OF TOMATO PASTE
½ TEASPOON CAYENNE PEPPER OR HOT HUNGARIAN PAPRIKA (OPTIONAL, BUT NICE IF YOU LIKE A LITTLE KICK)
2. MAKE THE BRISKET
• Pat the brisket dry. With the tip of a sharp knife, make slits in both sides of the meat and stuff with thin 
slices of garlic. The more you like garlic, the more slits you’ll make. Season each side very generously with 
⅔ of the salt and pepper.
• Heat oil in a large, heavy bottomed pot over medium high flame. When hot, brown the brisket on both 
sides, lowering heat as necessary so as not to burn. You’re looking for a nice brown color, not burnt. (And 
remember, don’t burn the sucs collecting in the bottom of the pot.)
• When browned, add beer, onions, remaining salt, tomato product, and cayenne if you’re using. There 
should be enough liquid to cover about ⅔ of the brisket. If you need more liquid, you can also use broth 
to supplement the beer. Stir and bring mixture to boil, then lower the flame so that broth remains 
“simmering,” i.e., not vigorous, but still moving gently. Cover the pot. (You can leave it on top of stove OR 
place in a 350°F preheated oven.)
• Cook until meat is very tender but not totally falling apart, at least two hours. More is fine. Just make sure to 
check along the way to ensure that you still have sufficient liquid in the pot to partially cover the meat. Add 
more if necessary.101
Red Meat, Pig, and Poultry (It's all good in small doses)• Remove brisket to a carving board and cover it with aluminum foil. Now look at the remaining oniony broth/
gravy and decide if you like what you see or you would like it to be thicker. If there is a lot of liquid, you can 
reduce it considerably by putting it back on the stove top, at a higher temperature, and reduce with heat 
until it reaches the consistency you desire. That could take a good 20 minutes IF you have a lot of liquid in 
the pot. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding more salt or pepper if necessary. Then slice brisket AGAINST 
the grain and top with onion gravy.
3. ADD THE FINISHING TOUCHES
Serve alongside something that will welcome all the sauce, like mashed potatoes, noodles, couscous, or a 
baguette and some bagged salad greens with a sprinkle of olive oil, lemon, and salt.
Once you understand the basic technique of searing and braising you can customize your own version with 
a variety of flavorful additions that excite you—40 cloves of garlic, herbs like thyme or a little rosemary, spices 
such as cumin, cinnamon, or curry powder, red wine instead of beer, dried apricots, or carrots and parsnips 
added during the last hour of cooking.
If you’re not in the mood for brisket, go ahead and braise short ribs. Or a shoulder of pork. The concept is 
the same: season and sear the meat, add aromatics like garlic and onion, and then cook slowly in a flavorful 
liquid until it gets as tender as you are tough. Now rejoice and eat meat!

2 SPRIGS THYME
2 BAY LEAVES
3 TABLESPOONS TOMATO PASTE
1 CUP CHICKEN STOCK (LOW SALT IS BEST)
CHOPPED PARSLEY, FOR GARNISH
PREPARATION
1. Preheat oven to 350°F .
2. Combine flour, salt, and pepper, dredge 
the shanks with the flour mixture, and 
shake off any excess.
3. Heat oil in large heavy ovenproof 
casserole or Dutch oven over medium-
high heat. Brown the veal in batches, 
on both sides. Remove it to a plate and 
continue until all the veal is browned. 
Use more oil along the way if you need.4. When veal is browned, drain any excess 
oil from pot. 
5. Pour in wine and cook over medium 
heat, scraping up the browned bits 
from the bottom. (This is not a test, but 
if you’ve been following along, I believe 
you know what those are called by now.) 
6. Stir in onion, carrots, celery, garlic, 
oregano, thyme, bay leaves, and tomato 
paste and give a swirl around. 
7. Now return the veal to the pot and pour 
in the chicken stock (should come about 
2/3 of the way up the veal). 
8. Add salt and pepper. 
9. Bring the mixture to a boil, then cover 
and cook it in the oven for about an 
hour until falling off the bone. Literally. 
That is, you can actually see the veal 
separating from the bone

in a bowl with sauce and veggies. 
11. Garnish with parsley. Great with risotto 
(page 154) and gremolata on the side 
(page 208).Osso Buco
Okay, you’ve made it this far, so here’s a recipe that’s just a tad ambitious. Not too complicated for the likes of 
you, but it calls for the most ingredients of any recipe in the book. Why? Because when osso buco is good, it’s 
great. And when you make it yourself, it’s even better. It falls off the bone, the sauce is killer, and it’s hugely 
impressive. The concept: dust the veal shanks with seasoned flour, brown them, add aromatic vegetables, and 
braise in wine and stock enhanced by tomato and herbs. Go ahead, you can do it.

3. Mix together mayonnaise and sriracha. 
Set aside.
4. Preheat the grill for high heat. Form the 
meat into four patties. (The chorizo is 
already salty, so no need to add salt.)
5. Grill burgers for 5 minutes per side, or 
until done to your liking. Split buns in 
half and toast briefly on grill.
6. Smear a dollop of sriracha mayo on 
buns, then place burgers onto buns and

Okay, to be honest, this is a few more ingredients than I would normally use or advise. BUT, I made it to enter it 
into some kind of contest and my own people enjoyed it a lot. Although it didn’t win the contest, it turns out that 
the judges never actually tasted the burger, they were just evaluating it by the photo I had sent in. They missed 
out; you don’t have to.
Note:  The chorizo in this recipe is the raw kind. (More likely to be Mexican than Spanish.) It is soft, unlike the 
firm type that’s already cooked or cured, similar to salami or pepperoni. And it often comes in links, in which 
case you would slice those open to remove the meat from its casing so that you can blend it with the hamburger 
meat. Therefore make sure you cook the burger well enough . . . and remember that you won’t have to pre-salt 
the burger meat because there’s already salt in the chorizo.SERVES 4–6, DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF

8. At this point they can be finished over a hot 
grill or placed back in the oven under the 
broiler until well browned on both sides. 
Either way, apply additional marinade on 
the ribs when you turn them over. 
9. Remove when sufficiently browned, 
brush with more marinade, and cut into 
individual ribs for serving. I’m thinking ice 
cold beer.MVP Ribs (Chinese-Spiced Baby Back Ribs)
If you enjoy the spare ribs at a Chinese restaurant you’re going to like these as well. It’s a simple two-step process I employ 
that yields finger-licking results. First you apply a dry rub and oven roast the ribs on low heat for a long time (“low and 
slow”). That gets them nice and soft. Then you brush them with a zesty marinade and finish them off on a grill or in the oven. 
In either case, these are a crowd-pleaser.
Note:  This makes more than enough marinade for basting and for brushing on ribs when they’re done. Since the ribs are 
cooked before applying the marinade there’s no need to worry about using the same marinade for sauce.

Among the thousands of different ways to make chicken, what sets this one-pot dish above most others is the rich 
creaminess of the sauce that results from the happy marriage of wine, garlic, and the chicken itself. And while the 41 cloves 
of garlic might sound like a lot, they get soft, mellow, and sweet during cooking. Perhaps best of all, braising is a most 
forgiving cooking method with formidable results practically guaranteed.

Red Meat, Pig, and Poultry (It's all good in small doses)Roast Chicken with a Lotta Lemon  
and Garlic Sauce
At some point you’re going to want to make a great roast chicken. Although it’s not complicated, to be totally blunt, it’s not 
always as simple as it sounds to get it just right, either. That may be why so many chefs and food professionals judge cooks 
by their ability to make a perfect roast chicken. What makes it perfect? Flavor, of course, as well as meat that maintains its 
juiciness and skin that crackles when you bite into it.
Although all you really need is salt, pepper, and heat, lemon and garlic add a lot of flavor and a TON of jus . Herbes 
de Provence  are a wonderful addition, but optional if you don’t have. Instead, you could certainly insert a few sprigs of 
rosemary, thyme, or tarragon directly into the cavity and allow their perfume to penetrate the bird.
Notes:
1. I’m big on high heat roasting because I want super crispy skin. So don’t be surprised if the fire alarm goes off. That just 
means that you have to keep your eye on the chicken as it’s roasting. If you see the skin getting too dark, you can either 
lower the heat and cook slightly longer, or cover the chicken with a lid (or foil), which I prefer, because that preserves 
the accumulated juices.
2. Herbes de Provence  is simply a blend of fragrant, dried herbs typically found in the southwest of France. Although 
readily available in supermarkets, you can easily make your own by mixing equal parts of any or all of these: rosemary, 
thyme, oregano, savory, and marjoram.
3. Get under the skin. What makes this chicken so flavorful comes from the lemon and garlic, some of which should be 
applied directly to the chicken meat underneath the skin. That requires that you loosen and lift the skin. Here’s how: 
With the breast side facing up, and entering at the bottom part of the chicken, left the skin away from the meat. Working 
slowly and gently—you don’t want to tear the skin—slide your fingers between the skin and the meat to separate as 
much and as far back as you can reach. In a way, you’re creating a pocket between chicken and skin.
4. The choice of cooking vessel matters. There will be some be some tradeoff between the amount of jus (juice)  that 
collects and the degree of crispy skin you can attain. I come out on the middle on this one. That is, I’m willing to 
sacrifice the crispy skin on the underside of the chicken (the thighs) in exchange for the quantity of jus. Therefore, I 
roast this breast-side-up only, in an enamel casserole-type dish that surrounds the chicken and allows juices to collect 
during cooking. An oval Dutch oven would be good as well (and I bet you could effectively use a glass Pyrex one, too). 
Although it could be argued that this is not true roasting, which is characterized by dry heat cooking exclusively, it’s 
not the definition I’m concerned about here. It’s the chicken. So . . . if you want a boatload of flavorful, lemony, garlicky 
juices in which to dip your chicken pieces, cook it in something that surrounds the chicken, thus allowing the liquid 
to accumulate. (A lot of which will eventually end up running down your chin.) If, on the other hand, you are more 
interested in attaining super crispy skin all over the bird, then roasting it on a flatter, open surface (or on a “roasting 
rack”) should evaporate a lot of the juices during cooking and allow all the skin to be more exposed to the dry heat that 
renders it crispy. In that case, just remember that to achieve even roasting and crisping on both sides, you’ll either need 
to turn the chicken over half-way through the roasting, or elevate the chicken on a roasting rack during cooking so that 
all the skin is exposed directly to the dry heat.

1. Heat the oven to 450°F . Rinse the

you dry it very well with paper towels.
2. If using, drizzle the chicken with a little 
stream of olive oil. 
3. Mix the salt, pepper, and herbs together 
and spread most of it all over and inside 
the chicken. Place most of the garlic in 
the cavity. Take the rest of it, together 
with the rest of the seasoning, and insert 
under the skin, as described above. 
4. Pour lemon juice and place lemon zest 
all over and around the chicken. Put the 
“used” lemon pieces into the cavity.
5. Roast for about 60 minutes or so, until 
the chicken is very crisp and the meat 
cooked through. (Remember the note 
above about covering if necessary.) The 
chicken is done when the juices from 
the thigh run clear. (To be safe, the 
government says that chicken is fully 
cooked at 165°F . That means to ensure 
juicy chicken, you should pull it out at 160 
and let the “residual heat” finish the job.) 
6. Let it rest for 15 minutes, then carve 
and serve proudly in the pan or on a 
platter. You might even want to serve the 
collected juices in their own gravy bowl.111

Chicken Parm is a lovable dish. The typical restaurant version can be kind of heavy, but my version is lighter 
and leaner because the chicken is baked rather than fried. Plus I avoid the usual time and mess of breading by 
sticking strictly to olive oil as the “glue” to adhere bread crumbs to the breasts.
Note:  Cooking time will depend entirely on the thickness of your chicken breasts.

Red Meat, Pig, and Poultry (It's all good in small doses)Honey, Soy, and Ginger Crispy  
Lacquered Chicken
Like most Americans, we eat a lot of chicken. So there’s a never-ending search to find new ways to make it. For 
me, that involves my usual formula:  the most taste, with the fewest ingredients and the least effort ™. In this case, I 
dedicate five ingredients to what they might call a Chinese flavor profile (soy, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, and Chinese 
five-spice). These are blended with honey and painted on the bird in order to end up with skin so crisp you can hear it 
when it cracks.
What you need to know:  The key again is Heat Management, riding that fine line between crisp and burnt. 
Because sweet stuff burns. When using sugar, or in this case, honey in the marinade, you must take extra care to 
avoid burning because sugars can burn before the underlying protein is ready. Although you could roast for a longer 
time on a lower heat, I find that the best way to ensure super crispy skin is to start with high heat. But you’ve got to be 
vigilant. So keep your eye on the prize as it roasts, baste it with marinade along the way, and turn down the heat when 
you see the skin becoming brown enough. You also have the option of covering the chicken—with a lid or aluminum 
foil—so that you can keep cooking without burning. You want to end up with a fully cooked chicken and a beautifully 
lacquered, mahogany-colored skin that cracks like thin glass.

1146. Cook another few minutes, return to 
skin side facing up, and finish cooking 
until skin is super brown and crisp 
and chicken is cooked through. (The 
government would like that to be

the juices from the chicken run clear, 
meaning that there’s no sign of redness

minutes.
Note:  All times are approximate but whole chicken will take the longest, butterflied will take less, and if using pieces only, 
those will cook the most quickly.

Red Meat, Pig, and Poultry (It's all good in small doses)Crispy Dry Rubbed Chicken Thighs 
(intuitive)
I have a thing for chicken thighs and a love affair with Costco, which sells them by the 32-pack. The good news is that they’re 
incredibly easy to prepare and pretty hard to screw up, which makes them an ideal playground for experimenting with your 
gustatory intuition. I always prefer bone-in and skin-on for the best flavor, and obviously the crispy skin, but you could opt for 
the boneless and skinless if you prefer. If so, you should know that they cook more quickly and they shrink a whole bunch 
during cooking.
You simply flavor them, amp up the heat in the oven, and let it fly . . . so to speak. In fact, if all you put on the chicken 
was a nice hit of salt and pepper, and let it roast until super brown and crispy, they’d be plenty good. Yet there’s so much 
more you can do to bring the flavor. That’s where the “intuitive” part comes into play. By playing with different seasoning 
combinations—or what chefs call “flavor profiles”—you can create unlimited varieties of wonderful taste sensations. For 
example, if I feel like a Mexican or Southwestern flavor I make a Latin spice blend that’s equal parts of chili powder, ancho 
chili powder, smoked paprika ( piment ón), and kosher salt. If I want it spicy instead I’ll douse the thighs with hot sauce. (I use 
Frank’s because it already has plenty of salt in it.) Feeling like Asian? I might use soy sauce, fresh ginger, five-spice powder, 
maybe Sichuan peppercorns. For Italian, I’d use garlic, oregano, maybe some red wine vinegar. It’s worth noting here that 
if you do use liquids for flavoring it can be slightly more challenging to get the intensely crisp skin that makes these thighs 
so irresistible. In that case, what I do is roast the thighs first for 15–20 minutes until they start to take on color, and then I’ll 
baste them heavily with the liquid-based flavoring. Or if I’m using only a dry rub I’ll cook them until crispy and apply a drizzle 
of honey or pomegranate molasses for those last few minutes of cooking. However, if you intend to fire them up over the 
grill, then go ahead and pour on the liquid flavoring up front . . . and baste along the way.
In any case, the point is that it’s your opportunity to play, to create your own palette of flavorings, and your own go-to 
chicken dish. (Also works with turkey thighs, although roasting time will be longer.)

PREPARATION
1. Preheat oven to 475°F . Season both sides of chicken well with the dry rub. Roast 
on baking sheet skin side up for about 15 minutes, turn over and keep cooking for 
another 15 minutes. (Or not. This is one of those where you could keep it skin side for 117
Red Meat, Pig, and Poultry (It's all good in small doses)the entire cooking time if the skin isn’t burning. In either case, just make sure that the 
skin gets nice and brown and very crispy. That’s where the action is.)
2. You can reduce heat at any point you see too much color on the chicken, or when your 
smoke alarm goes off. After 30 minutes, check for doneness. Your best bet is always 
the thermometer, where 165°F is your goal here, but you could also cut into the thigh, 
close to the bone, to ensure that there’s no pinkness. If more cooking time is needed, 
return to skin side up and cook until skin is well browned and crispy and the meat is 
cooked through. Total cooking time can vary between 30–50 minutes depending on the 
size of the thighs and the heat of your oven.
3. You’ll be tempted to dig right in, but let them sit and rest a few minutes before doing 
so. They’re also good cold the next day.

Feel free to sprinkle the pan with your 
favorite dried herbs (like rosemary, 
sage, thyme, or tarragon).
3. Roast turkey in oven, covering with 
aluminum foil if/when skin starts to 
get too crisp. Roasting time depends 
on size of the breast, and your oven; 5

(an instant-read thermometer is a most 
worthwhile investment if you don’t 
already own one) and then remove 
breast to a platter or serving plate.
4. While you allow the turkey to “rest” for 
20–30 minutes, add a cup of water to the 
vegetables in pan. Over low flame, stir 
it around, making sure to scrape up any 
brown goodness that has adhered to 
the pan. Taste and adjust the sauce for 
seasoning. Slice turkey and serve with 
pan juices (jus)  spooned over.Roast Turkey Breast
People look forward to their Thanksgiving turkey. So why do so few folks make it the other 364 days of the 
year? I imagine it’s because we see it as a cumbersome operation, appropriate only for a large gathering. But 
it doesn’t have to be, especially if you make the breast only. Follow these four easy steps and I promise you a 
terrific tasting turkey that you’ll be thankful for any day of the week. The key is to keep the white meat moist . . .

MAKES 4 BURGERS
INGREDIENTS
1½ TABLESPOONS OLIVE OIL
¼ CUP DICED ONION
1 POUND GROUND TURKEY (ORGANIC, IF POSSIBLE, 
AND NOT TOO LEAN)
¼ TEASPOON EACH OF SALT AND PEPPER
1 HANDFUL FRESH DILL, FINEL Y CHOPPED  
(ABOUT 3 TABLESPOONS)PREPARATION
1. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in skillet and 
sauté onions over medium heat until 
they’re soft, fragrant, and just beginning 
to lightly brown.
2. Remove from pan and let them cool.
3. Mix the turkey in a bowl with onions, 
salt, pepper, and dill and form into four 
equal size hamburger patties.
4. Heat skillet with remaining ½ 
tablespoon of oil and cook hamburgers 
on medium high heat, turning once, 
until browned and cooked through, 
approximately 8 minutes. Perhaps 
instead of ketchup consider topping it 
with cranberry sauce (recipe page 204).Let’s Talk Turkey . . . Burgers  
(with Onions and Dill)
I can’t be the only one who appreciates a good turkey burger. The problem is that they are often rightfully maligned for being 
dry and bland. That is easily rectified by amping up the flavor profile and adding a measure of moistness to ensure that you 
end with one that’s tasty and juicy.
The flavor part is not too difficult because you can incorporate a wide variety of ingredients to the ground turkey before 
you make patties and cook ’em up. Variations aplenty include using your favorite spices or herbs—anything from a good hit 
of fresh rosemary or dried tarragon to cumin, curry, chili powder, toasted fennel seeds, seasoned salt, or soy sauce and a 
dash of sesame oil for an Asian accent. Use your imagination to customize.
As far as the moisture quotient, I quickly sauté onion until soft and fragrant and add it to the ground meat along with 
some freshly chopped dill, salt, and pepper. Then I cook ’em up until golden in either a frying pan/skillet or on the grill. The 
onions and dill keep them from getting dried out and contribute a wonderful flavor.123

Ah, the tenderloin of pork. So lovely. Not hard to cook. But, as lean as skinless chicken breasts, it needs a little help to 
ensure that it becomes tasty and juicy rather than, well, tasteless and dry. Therefore, we’ll brine it first, then maximize 
its flavor potential by applying the salty seasoning mix of your choosing (another “intuitive” play) and make sure not to 
overcook it. You want to see some pink inside. As for the seasoning, as long as you use salt, you can create the rest on 
your own.
To cook, you could go all “top of stove” in a heavy gauge pan (like cast-iron), or roasted in the oven. Or do both—
whereby you’d sear it atop the stove and finish the cooking in the oven. I actually prefer that method because it 
produces a superior outside crusting and luscious light pinkness within. (You’ll need an ovenproof pan.)
The key is your internal temperature. Well, not your  internal temperature, the pork’s. Anyway, you’re going to 
want it somewhere in the vicinity of 145°F for medium rare and 160°F for medium. That means you’re going to have 
to pull it from the heat 5 degrees before  it reaches that temperature because it will continue cooking off the heat 
(residual cooking). You must also  let it rest before cutting.
Place the pork in the brining liquid, cover, and refrigerate for anywhere from a couple of hours to overnight. When ready to 
cook, make sure to dry the pork loin thoroughly.125
Red Meat, Pig, and Poultry (It's all good in small doses)PREPARATION
1. Preheat oven to 375°F .
2. Rub the loin with 1 teaspoon of oil and apply the salt mix all over.
3. Over high heat put a teaspoon of oil in ovenproof pan and sear meat well on both sides.
4. Place pan in oven and continue cooking until reaching the desired doneness/
temperature, approximately 15–20 minutes.
5. Remove to cutting board, cover, and let it rest for 10 minutes, then slice and be happy.
Brining
Tasty and tender is what you get when you brine, the process of soaking food in a saltwater solution that 
is often infused with other savory flavors as well. This saline bath moisturizes meats and poultry, and 
adding aromatics will impart a piquant dimension. It works particularly well for pork loin, which can 
become somewhat dried out when cooked. The basic ratio for a brining liquid is 20 parts of water to one 
salt, to which I then might add aromatics, pepper, herbs, and sugar.127

This is as succulent, saucy, and satisfying as it gets. A one-pot affair that uses an inexpensive cut of meat 
slowly braised beyond tender in a flavor-filled broth of beer suffused with Latin spices, this dish is great for 
a crowd. It is not a mole  by any means, which is a rich and complex Mexican sauce that typically requires 
MANY ingredients to make. Rather, it is an attempt to create a robust braising medium that incorporates a few 
of the flavorings one might find in a mole, such as chile peppers and cocoa. They key here is to brown all the 
meat well without burning the brown material ( sucs ) that will be accruing in the bottom of the pot. Again, heat 
management matters.
Notes:
Costco sells these Pork Shoulder Country Style Ribs Boneless. I don’t recall seeing them elsewhere. Don’t 
fret if you can’t find them, though; there are options. You can either get them on the bone or you can buy pork 
shoulder—with or without the bone—and use the same basic ingredients and technique.
Although you could purchase something like Goya Adobo or Sazón in the supermarket, I’d suggest that you 
just as easily make a Latin spice mix yourself. (If you do store-bought, make sure to add some chili powder 
for flavor and color.) I blend chili powder, ancho chile powder, smoked paprika, and salt. You can also add or 
substitute cumin, oregano, and chipotle chile powder, which contributes another smoky element. And you 
could just as easily use three or four whole dried chiles (e.g., ancho, chipotle, pasilla, etc.), which I actually toss 
directly into the broth. They’ll break apart over time; just remember to remove their stems either before or after 
cooking. They are a bitch to discover by accident in your mouth."
"Short Order Dad
128PREPARATION
1. While you heat oil in a large, heavy pot (like a Dutch oven), spread about ¾ of the spice 
mix all over and around the meat. (Reserve some for later in the cooking.) 
2. Brown the seasoned meat well on both sides, being careful not to burn the bits 
forming on the pan’s bottom. When all browned, drop in the onion and garlic and move 
them around until you smell them cooking. 
Note:  You could remove the meat to sauté the garlic and onion for a few moments until 
fragrant, but it’s an avoidable extra step if you can instead reposition the meat so that the 
“aromatics” are exposed to the bottom of the pan.
3. Dump* in the beer—reserving a swig for yourself—to cover ¾ of the meat. Now the 
ketchup, brown sugar, cocoa, and cinnamon go in, as well as the remaining spice mix 
IF you want a lotta flavor in there. Bring it to a boil, then reduce to simmer for a long 
while, 2–3 hours. You don’t have to worry about it falling off the bone because there 
is no bone. However, after two hours, the meat generally maintains some semblance 
of shape, whereas after three hours of cooking, it falls to pieces faster than Patsy 
Cline. (I’ll admit, that’s a pretty obscure reference.) In that case, it becomes more like 
a chunky pork stew . . . and works quite well served over pretty much anything or 
inside some warm tortillas, perhaps touched up with some avocado, shredded cheese, 
cilantro, and salsa or green sauce. How good does that sound?
* I do recognize that dump  is neither typical culinary terminology, nor particularly taste appealing.129

In planning a trip to Portugal I was most excited about finding and devouring clams with pork, a classic 
combination in Portuguese cooking. In my version, I combine small littleneck clams with Spanish chorizo 
(already cured, not uncooked), which lends a smoky counterpoint to the tangy dry white wine–flavored broth in 
which the clams are steamed open. It is an easy, yet impressive, start to any meal. It also makes for a complete 
meal when served with a simple salad. As for wine, the rule is never to cook with any wine you wouldn’t drink, 
but I’d even take it a step further: cook these clams with the very wine that you are going to drink. I’d suggest a 
nice Sancerre or Pinot Gris.
Note:  Clams should be individually scrubbed under cold running water or rinsed in three changes of water to 
get rid of any sand.

1389 Ways to Satisfy  
a Clam Frenzy
It started with nibbling, munching, even licking 
every clam I could get my tongue on.
It was coastal Maine, America’s very own heartland 
of clam, and I was on a clam bender.
In the midst of my mollusk frenzy, I took a moment 
to post an image to Facebook. It was of a large 
bucket of steamers. I was taken aback by the rapid 
response of my friend Julie, who commented, “Am 
I the only one who thinks clams are disgusting?”
No, she is undoubtedly not the only clam hater. 
So why was I so surprised? Because Julie is an 
Ivy League-educated, supremely gifted artist, and 
an otherwise lovely, open-minded soul . . . with a 
profound appreciation for the sea.
Therefore, I feel a responsibility to report on all the 
clammy wonderfulness that Julie is missing as a 
consequence of her inexplicable and wrongheaded 
aversion.
Fried clams . If there are three perfect fried 
foods in the world, the other two are chicken and 
potatoes. In the case of the clam, that is due to the 
textural sensation of the golden coating juxtaposed 
against the salty sweetness of the entrapped clam. 
However, caveat emptor : there are fried clams, 
and then there are fried clams. More specifically, 
fried clam strips, which use only a portion of the 
whole clam, yield an unworthy breading-to-clam 
ratio. Instead, what you want is the whole clam 
belly, well coated and properly fried in clean, hot 
oil, to produce the total joy that comes from the 
soft, seaworthy oozing revealed upon mastication. 
A squeeze of lemon is fine, and perhaps a tiny dip of homemade tartar sauce might enhance the 
heavenly happiness. But none for Julie.
Steamed clams . Here I refer to the soft-shell 
bivalves known as “steamers.” Best when served in 
the aforementioned bucket, they do require a little 
work before ingestion. That is, one must perform 
somewhat of a culinary circumcision by pulling off 
the small, black foreskin-like membrane that covers 
the neck of the clam. Don’t be put off by this quick 
and easy procedure, for when these plump-from-
the-sea sand dwellers are good and fresh, they want 
for nothing more than the briefest bath in the hot 
clam broth that accompanies their arrival for the 
purpose of removing any extraneous sand particles. 
Sure, you could also dip ’em into the warm melted 
butter, but when their succulent, bulbous bellies 
are at their eating peak, they’re so sweet that you 
shouldn’t even have to. And Julie don’t get none.
Baked clams . A.k.a. Clams Oreganata and Clams 
Casino . Some places will chop up clams and fill 
a large clam shell with a little clam and a lot of 
superfluous breading. Don’t go to those places. The 
experience you’re paying for is the whole clam, its 
own half-shell stuffed with fresh, seasoned bread 
crumbs, then placed under a burning hot broiler 
so as to render it browned and just crisp enough. 
Then, one sucks out the entire production at once, 
creating a cacophonous culinary crescendo of clam 
and crumb in your watering mouth. A proper baked 
clam is a thing of beauty—sweet, salty, crunchy, 
and a little chewy. Clams casino, by the way, 
include a little bit of bacon, adding another flavorful 
dimension to an already wondrous composition. 
Disgusting? Au contraire,  Julie.
Clam chowder . You’ve got your creamy New 
England variety and your tomato-based Manhattan 
version. Each has its proponents and detractors. 139
Adventures in SeafoodAlthough neither will hurt you, if I had to choose 
only one to warm the cockles of my heart on 
a dreary, damp, rainy day, it would have to be 
New England’s. Chock-full of moist potatoes and 
generous, fat chunks of quahog clams peeking out 
from a rich, velvety clam broth, often accented by 
the slightly smoky hint of bacon. Sorry, Julie, only 
tomato soup for you.
Clam pizza . They may not be too common to come 
by, but if you like clams, come by one. The clam 
pizza at Zuppardi’s in West Haven, Connecticut, for 
example, is made with just-shucked clams and a 
hint of fresh garlic on a perfectly blistered pizza 
crust. There is no cheese on this pie, nor tomato 
sauce. Rather, imagine something akin to a paper 
thin, piping hot bruschetta topped with gossamer 
clams and a sauce produced by the very liquid they 
release upon baking. Say what you might about 
clam pie; this is a work of gastronomic art. I’ve also 
had it with mozzarella and it is none too shabby. 
Alas, Julie won’t be having a slice.
Linguini with clam sauce . Nor will Julie 
be enjoying a perfect plate of al dente pasta 
populated by whole baby clams, aroused by garlic, 
swimming ever so lightly in a shallow pool of 
goodness produced by olive oil with perhaps a 
hit of butter that has been suffused by the juicy 
juice of the clams themselves. On behalf of all 
Americans—with the exception of Julie—I’d like 
to thank the Italians for this elegant contribution to 
civilization.
Clams in black bean sauce . Let us not leave out 
the Chinese when it comes to plaudits for excellent 
clam combinations. In this formidable pairing, 
one licks the clam from the shell and immediately 
notices its natural sweetness when set against the 
pungent black sauce. Julie will have to make do 
with the white rice on the side.Raw clams . Served “on the half shell,” this 
is pleasure of the pristine variety. Although 
littlenecks  have come to stand for a size 
categorization, their name is said to have derived 
from the source where they were originally 
cultivated, Little Neck Bay, in Queens, New York, 
where I coincidentally fell for my first love, Gina 
Maria Imbriola Theresa Camiletti. My second love: 
clams. Or, you might opt for the cherrystones , 
which are larger, thicker and chewier, but also 
delightful. In either case, they require nothing 
more than a light squirt of lemon and a touch of 
horseradish-studded cocktail sauce with perhaps 
a splash of Tabasco if you so desire. But please, 
not too much; it’s the clam you’re paying for, not 
the sauce. And what you get for your money is a 
symphony of slurping the sweet, saline essence of 
the sea. One must appreciate the natural goodness 
of a food with so much flavor, yet so little fat, carbs, 
or calories. Clams 8, Julie 0.
Grilled clams . Whole, rinsed, unopened clams 
are placed onto the grate of a hot barbecue, the 
grill covered. Almost miraculously, they will 
open themselves the second they are ready, 
about 4–5 minutes, depending on the heat of the 
grill and size of the clam. Once they do, you will 
remove them ever so gently so as not to lose one 
single eyedropful of the glorious liquid inside the 
shell—officially known as the clam’s liquor—in 
which they have just steamed. You will proceed 
to vacuum out the entire clam and its intoxicating 
broth into your awaiting gullet and marvel at the 
wonder of one of the very few foods in existence 
that require not one single other ingredient  to 
improve upon it. For my money, this is the very 
best one-ingredient dish in the world. Your friends 
will ask for the recipe, and you will think kindly of 
me. Except, of course, for Julie.141

Another seemingly fancy-sounding dish that you can do well with ease and in not a ton of time. The trick again 
is knowing when to stop cooking the scallops. Like shrimp, they can go from pretty perfect to pretty chewy in 
no time flat. That said, you might try practicing on a single scallop to get a sense of how long you need to cook 
it. Not to complicate it, but of course not all sea scallops (the bigger ones vs. the smaller bay scallops) are the 
same size. In every case, what you’re looking for is what is called just cooked through, which means they do 
not look raw on the inside, but they don’t look well done either. There is a middle ground, and that’s what you 
want—a slight hint of translucence. The rest of the cooking process is super simple. The finished product is 
sublime.

Ladle liquid over mussels and serve 
immediately. Pass the baguette.Mussels Marini Ère (in White Wine)
Something magical happens when shellfish release their natural saline juices into a winey broth infused with 
herbs, aromatics, and a touch of butter. Once you master this recipe, you’re going to want to make it frequently. 
Great for an appetizer or fine for dinner, too. Just make sure you have a baguette on hand to sop up all that 
luscious broth in the bowl. And a lot of napkins.

1 POUND LARGE SHRIMP , PREFERABL Y WILD, 
PEELED AND DEVEINED
2 TABLESPOONS ANCHO CHILE POWDER (USE 
REGULAR CHILI POWDER IF YOU CAN’T FIND 
ANCHO, BUT TRY TO FIND THE ANCHO)
4 CLOVES GARLIC, PEELED AND THINL Y SLICED
3 TABLESPOONS OLIVE OIL
SALT AND BLACK PEPPER TO TASTE
2 TABLESPOONS FRESH SQUEEZED LIME JUICE
LARGE HANDFUL FRESH CHOPPED CILANTRO 
(AROUND 3 TABLESPOONS)
PREPARATION
1. In a bowl, toss shrimp with ancho 
powder so that it is coated. Add garlic. 
This may be refrigerated, well covered, 
for several hours at this point.2. When ready to cook, heat olive oil in 
large skillet over medium high heat. 
When oil begins to shimmer, add shrimp 
in one layer. Sprinkle with salt and 
pepper.
3. When shrimp turns from translucent to 
that lovely red color, turn over and cook 
on the other side until just about done. 
This will only take a few minutes. Add 
the lime juice and toss until completely 
cooked.
4. Remove to plate. Check and adjust 
seasonings, including lime, then top 
with cilantro, serve, and enjoy.Ancho Chile Shrimp (intuitive)
This dish is a Short Order Dad staple in our home. If you love shrimp—or you see it on sale—try it this way. The beauty 
of ancho chile is that it imparts a faint fruity smokiness, not heat. And the dish is very adaptable: we eat them straight 
up, as an appetizer, or serve them over a bed of linguine as a first or main course. Or remove the tail altogether, slice 
the shrimp in half, and place them inside a couple of tortillas with melty cheese and a touch of salsa, toast both sides, 
and you’ve got yourself a killer quesadilla. In which case, don’t forget a margarita for the grown-ups (on page 241).
Note:  The trick with shrimp is not overcooking them. They become rubbery when you do.
Ancho Shrimp over Fettuccini
If you decide to serve this over pasta you’re going to need to use more oil and lime juice to serve as your sauce. 
So cook a pound of fettuccine, have more olive oil, lime juice, and cilantro available to dress the pasta, AND dice 
up a ripe avocado and toss that in as well. Good stuff.147

Make your own. Period. I cannot recall the last time I purchased tomato sauce in a jar from a supermarket. 
Maybe a thousand years ago. Why? Making your own is fresher, less expensive, pretty easy, and better. And 
all you basically need is oil, onions, garlic, and decent tomatoes that are perfectly good from a can. This recipe 
probably makes more than you need for a typical meal, but it freezes well and will come in handy not only for 
pasta, but for my chicken parmigiana (page 111) and meatball (page 123) recipes, too.

SuperBowls—Noodles, Soups,and Salads SERVES 4 TO 6
INGREDIENTS
6 OUNCES PECORINO ROMANO CHEESE, FINEL Y 
GRATED (ABOUT 3 CUPS)
1 POUND SPAGHETTI, LINGUINE, OR BUCATINI
1½ TEASPOONS SALT
1 TABLESPOON EXTRA-VIRGIN OLIVE OIL
1½ TEASPOONS COARSEL Y GROUND BLACK PEPPER
PREPARATION
1. Put cheese in a large bowl. Put a pot of 
water on to boil. When boiling, add pasta 
and salt and cook, stirring frequently. 
When pasta is just al dente, remove it by 
either draining it into a colander set over 
a bowl OR by using tongs. Either way, 
make sure to reserve 1½ cups of that 
cooking water!  Place drained pasta in 
a bowl.
2. Slowly whisk about a cup of your 
reserved cooking water into the grated Pecorino until smooth. Keep whisking 
as you add in oil and black pepper. Pour 
cheese mixture over pasta, and toss 
vigorously to coat all the pasta. You want 
the sauce to cling to the pasta and be 
creamy but not watery, so you can adjust 
the consistency with the remaining 
reserved pasta water.
3. Serve immediately, with additional 
Pecorino and pepper on the side.Cacio e Pepe
(Spaghetti with Pecorino Romano and Black Pepper)
My kids didn’t believe me about this one. As much as they adore pasta, they certainly didn’t think they’d like one with this 
much pepper . Alas, it is their favorite pasta in the world. Brought to you by the Italians, the sauce in this classic Roman 
spaghetti dish is composed of Pecorino Romano cheese, a ton of crushed black pepper, and a bit of the pasta cooking water. 
My strong suggestion if you make it is to use imported Pecorino Romano (it’s hard, aged, and salty) if you want the real deal.
To know: al dente literally means “to the bite,” which means that pasta should be cooked to the point where it maintains a 
little chewiness. NOT soft and mushy. So in making this dish, and all pasta for that matter, taste your pasta while it cooks so 
that you can pull it from the water while it still has some “bite” to it.

1 CUP CHICKEN OR VEGETABLE STOCK
LARGE HANDFUL PARSLEY, CHOPPED (2–3

¼ CUP PARMESAN CHEESE
RED PEPPER FLAKES (OPTIONAL)
PREPARATION
1. Preheat oven to 450°F .
2. Mix squash together with 2 tablespoons 
of the oil; sprinkle with salt, pepper, and 
nutmeg. Lay it flat on a baking sheet and roast until it’s tender and beginning to 
brown, about 15–20 minutes.
3. Bring a large pot of water to the boil and 
add a good bit of salt. Cook pasta until 
al dente, drain it,  and save a cup of the 
cooking water.
4. Meanwhile add remaining 2 tablespoons 
of oil to a pan over medium high heat 
and sauté onion and garlic for a couple 
of minutes until soft and just beginning 
to brown. Pour in the stock and bring 
mixture to simmer, then fold in the pasta, 
squash, parsley, cheese, and pepper 
flakes, if using. Stir to combine everything 
together. If sauce seems too thick you can 
add in some of the pasta cooking water, 
a little bit at a time. Adjust seasoning to 
taste. But really, you know that by now. 
Must I keep repeating myself?Pasta with Squash
Cutting squash can be challenging because of its thick skin (unlike some people I know). But it’s certainly 
doable. Alternatively, squash comes already peeled and cut in many supermarkets these days, so there’s 
a ready excuse to go the lazy way. Roasting, as we know, makes the veg soft and sweet, and a delightful 
component of this toothsome* pasta dish.
Notes:
1) This sauce goes best with a tubular shaped pasta like penne, ziti, or rigatoni.
2) To convert this from a side dish to something more ample, you might add prosciutto at the end. Cooked 
pancetta would not hurt you, either.
*In writing this, I felt that the word  toothsome  was appropriate, but wasn’t entirely sure what it meant. Hang on a minute, let 
me look it up. Okay, according to Google, here you go:
tooth·some ˈto͞oTHs əm/ adjective. (of food) temptingly tasty. “a toothsome morsel”
synonyms: tasty, delicious, luscious, mouthwatering, delectable, succulent;
More: tempting, appetizing, inviting; informal scrumptious, nummy, finger-licking, melt-in-your-mouth, lip-smacking, “a 
toothsome lemon tart”

1 TABLESPOON OLIVE OIL
1 TABLESPOON UNSALTED BUTTER
¼ CUP FINEL Y CHOPPED ONION (OR SHALLOT)
1 CUP (8 OUNCES) ARBORIO-TYPE RICE (ITALIAN 
RICE, SMALL ROUND KERNELS)
½ TEASPOON SALT (AND PEPPER TO TASTE)
¼ CUP GRATED PARMESAN CHEESEPREPARATION
1. Heat up the chicken stock in a pot over a 
low simmer.
2. Heat oil and melt butter in a skillet over 
medium high heat. When bubbling hot, 
add onion and sauté for a minute or so, 
until softened, not browned. 
3. Add the rice and salt, stirring and 
toasting the rice until it takes on just a 
hint of golden color (2 minutes or so). 
4. Spoon in one ladle of stock and stir 
around using a wooden spoon, until 
absorbed. Then add the next ladle and 
repeat the process until all the stock is 
absorbed. The rice should be creamy 
and tender at that point, probably 
around 12 minutes or so.
5. Take it off the heat, blend in the Parmesan 
cheese, taste and adjust seasoning, and 
serve at once. Notice smiles.Righteous Risotto
This is the only time I will use this word in the book , but yummy  seems to be the ideal description for this 
classic, creamy rice dish. To do it right, you should be willing to spend about fifteen minutes over the stove 
because in the ideal world you’d be adding stock gradually and incrementally to the rice as it is absorbed. But 
really, folks, let’s be honest: the world is not ideal. SO . . . if you’re feeling lazy and impatient (my default position) 
I suppose you could add the stock all at once and hope for the best results, but I can’t guarantee you’ll get them*. 
I’m not here to judge, just inform. What matters is that you get the right Italian rice, specifically intended for 
risotto. Arborio is the most common, but you might discover others. (Carnaroli, for example.) Also, you can find 
the end result in image form on page 102.
* An alternate way of doing this is to add 3 cups of the stock at the beginning, bring it to a simmer, cover the pot, 
and cook for about 10 minutes or so until most of the liquid has been absorbed. Then uncover and proceed as 
above, adding in that final bit of remaining stock and cooking before completing with cheese.155

There is something a little luxurious about a pool of thick, steaming, bright-green soup set in a white bowl. And 
there’s no reason to buy soup already prepared when you can so easily make a seriously scrumptious version 
yourself with minimal effort. Use frozen peas, which tend to keep their sweetness and vibrant color, even when 
frozen. The key to preparing this luscious and delightful first course is to gently “sweat” the carrot, celery, and 
onion base, and avoid “caramelizing,” or browning altogether. When ready to serve this fragrant and colorful 
soup, don’t just say pea soup. Instead, call it potage de petits pois  (pronounced PO—Tä ZH duh petty pwah).

PREPARATION
1. Remove all the skin from the chicken 
except for the wings. Clean and rinse 
the chicken well, inside and out.
2. In a large pot, lay the chicken with the 
large pieces of onion, celery, and carrots. 
Add the garlic cloves, the dill branches, and enough cold water to cover it all. Boil 
with lid on for about 45 minutes.
3. Remove the chicken as well as the rest 
of the ingredients with a slotted spoon. 
(Although you could certainly cut up and 
use these aromatic vegetables, their 
flavor has already been well absorbed 
into the broth.) DO NOT TOUCH THAT 
LIQUID. Just bring the heat down and 
allow it to simmer. If you notice any scum 
on the surface of the broth, spoon it off.
4. Remove the entire breasts from the 
chicken, and using two forks, finely 
shred all that white meat, and return it 
to the broth. If you’d prefer, you could 
also cut it into bite-size pieces, and you 
could choose to cut and add in the dark 
meat as well. (If not, hit it with a pinch of 
salt and pop it into your mouth for pure 
poultry pleasure.)
5. Also back into the simmering broth go 
that diced parsnip, turnip, and leek, 
together with some salt and pepper. Let 
it simmer for about 15 minutes. Adjust 
seasoning. Serve in bowls, topped with 
either finely chopped dill fronds or 
parsley or scallions.
6. Congratulations. You have made world-

This one requires a little prep work, but once you smell the aroma that fills your home as it simmers, I would ask that you 
think of me. (And then buy another copy of this book for a friend or family member, please.) The key, as always, is to get the 
best chicken you can. Take note that the onion, celery, and carrot in the ingredient list below will have two separate uses. 
Some of it goes into the initial cooking liquid to infuse the chicken broth, and then later in the process, the rest will go into 
the soup itself. Once you master this one, friends and family will flock. (Unlike this chicken, alas, which will no longer.) And it 
freezes very well, too, for that cold winter’s day.

4. Blend to thick and creamy with either

also be cooled and frozen.Potato Leek Soup ( Potage Parmentier )
It has often been said that there’s nothing like a thick and creamy bowl of hot soup on a cold day, right? Well, 
this one’s plenty thick, but uses no cream whatsoever. Instead, good old potatoes beautifully flavored by leeks 
provide the smooth and hearty bowl of goodness.
Note:  Always be super careful when blending hot liquids, such as soup. The steam heat can literally blow the 
lid off the top of a blender. So you need to vent. (Who doesn’t?) In this case, that means to remove the stopper 
from the blender top and cover it with a cloth before pulsing. Better yet, think about investing in one of those 
immersion blenders that goes right into the pot itself.
* Cleaning leeks: Cut off the hard, green outer leaves of the leeks (the softer, light green is okay) and trim the root end. Split 
the leek in half lengthwise and fan open under running water, washing it well inside to remove any and all sand or dirt.161

Anyone who is fortunate enough to live near a part of the country where tomatoes and corn grow locally looks

need to do much with them when corn and tomatoes are at their peak, but I like to add a third dimension of taste

such as cilantro or oregano. Sweet, juicy, and savory—it’s good eating. Especially next to some sizzling steak

basil. All good. And a great way to stimulate the appetite before serving something savory from the grill. 
(Speaking of which, grilling watermelon slices is a big idea. Try it, it works.)

164Salads
So often, salads are forgettable. I think that’s because they’re generally served as the precursor to 
something else we call the “main course.” Their ingredients are uninspiring, their composition haphazard, 
and their dressing either over- or under-whelming. A shameful waste of perfectly good stomach space.
Then there are the salads that pleasure your taste buds and stimulate your palate. So irresistible that 
you don’t want them to end. That is a sexy salad.
So what does it take to have one?
1. FRESHNESS. The components should be fresh, not canned or frozen. There are exceptions (marinated 
artichoke hearts, water chestnuts, beans), but very few. Straight-from-the-garden matters.
2. TEXTURE.  You need texture. I like the crispiness of romaine, but whatever lettuce you choose as your 
base, it should be supplemented by shredded vegetables that have crunch; carrots and purple cabbage 
are ideal. Croutons are fabulous when they’re homemade—if not, you’re eating stale bread. Nuts and 
seeds are a delight.
3. INGREDIENTS.  Not counting the lettuce, more than six or seven ingredients is generally overkill. 
Choose veggies (carrots, cukes, mushrooms, tommies), your protein (chicken, tuna, turkey), a 
corresponding cheese (blue, Parm, feta), and a little extra “something something,” like pine nuts. They 
rock; sunflower seeds are brilliant, too. Craisins don’t suck.
4. CHOP IT. I’m not sure what we did before they routinely started chopping salad. But I’ve taken a poll, 
and people want their salad chopped. Making it at home? You’ll want to own a “ double mezzaluna. ”
5. DRESSING.  Do not overdress. Drowning a salad is a cardinal sin. And unless you’re going with nothing 
but a wedge of iceberg and crispy bacon bits—perfect with blue cheese dressing—avoid the creamy kinds 
that tend to dominate. The dressing is not the star, but a supporting player. A simple vinaigrette allows the 
salad’s constituents to shine.165

If you can get your hands on juicy, pink grapefruit and perfectly ripe avocados, then consider combining 
them into this wonderful and good looking salad. Their best individual characteristics—the sweet and tart of 
grapefruit, the creamy richness of avocado—complement each other rather beautifully. The concept is simple 
and the dressing can be as well. The execution, however, does require a certain dexterity to cut and slice the 
elements properly so that you end up with clean grapefruit segments (without pits or the white pith) and slender 
avocado slices of roughly equal size. If so, you win.
Note:  Save whatever grapefruit juice you can as cut them, and add it to whatever dressing you use. You can 
always use a basic vinaigrette, or just splash a little olive oil and a touch of vinegar across the top.167

(or How to Titillate Your Tuna)
Tuna conjures up a number of images for me. It used to be that smelly stuff that came out of a can, sold as either Solid 
White or Chunk Light, in water or oil. Tuna has since graduated from those days to include the kind eaten raw at the sushi 
bar. Particularly sublime is the fatty variety that comes from the belly, the otoro . But you can feed a family of four for what a 
single piece of that costs. There’s also the seared tuna one often sees on restaurant menus, nicely charred and peppery on 
the outside, often served pretty rare on the inside. “Black & blue,” the chefs call it. Delightful.
Still the most popular is canned tuna, often blended with mayo and whatever else, generally served in a sandwich or 
scooped over salad. This is the tuna I recall from childhood. With disgust. It’s not that I didn’t like “tuna fish salad,” as they 
called it. It’s just that by lunchtime in school the sandwich my mother had made for me—with mayo, onion, and celery on 
white bread—was completely soggy, the tuna was warm, and it smelled, and looked . . . like cat food. All in all, a depressing, 
soaking wet, stinking mess . . . that I never ate. Thankfully she also put chips and a banana in my Superman lunch box, so at 
least I had something to munch on.
Well, I have new appreciation for tuna “salad” these days, perhaps nostalgic—but never enough to make it with onion 
and celery, my recollection still haunted by the mess in my third grade lunch box. Instead I throw in variety of readily 
available ingredients that bring flavor, texture, and excitement to yesteryear’s “tuna salad.” As I said, this is not your mother’s 
tuna salad. Although the secret ingredient*, ironically, was suggested to me by . . . my very own mother.

1. Clean and rinse the veggies well.

covered pan over medium heat with salt 
and whatever water clings to them from 
the washing. Three minutes or so is fine, 
or until they’re tender.
3. Drain and dry the pan.

turns just a slight nutty brown.
5. Add the greens and toss around for 
another couple of minutes.
6. Taste and adjust seasoning.
7. Add a squeeze of lemon, if you like.
8. Serve away.SautÉed Greens (Kale, Collards, or Chard)
I have no recollection whatsoever of eating fresh greens as a kid. Maybe string beans. But certainly nothing 
leafy. Even spinach came frozen. Yet if you go to the average grocery store these days you can find a wide array 
of leafy vegetables that I never even knew existed as a youngster. Kale, Swiss chard, collards, dandelion greens, 
mustard greens, and so on. Whichever you decide upon, I find that they’re at their best when simply prepared 
with olive oil, garlic, and salt. Maybe a squeeze of lemon.
Note: The directions below call for quickly steaming the greens before sautéing them. However, you can skip 
that and go directly to the sauté if you want. That works better for softer greens, such as spinach, but less well 
for those that are firmer, such as kale, which require a bit more cooking to soften.

Like many others, my kids had no interest in broccoli. Not steamed. Not roasted. No way. No how. Then 
something happened. I think it was at a pizza place. We ordered the broccoli with garlic and oil. And it came all 
soft and chopped up. And my kids ate it up. Loved it. So much so that we often start restaurant meals now with 
chopped broccoli instead of the usual loaf of bread. Who knew?
Note:  Save some of the cooking water . . . it might come in handy.
Note: Go right ahead and roast that broccoli if you want. It’s superb that way, too.175

both sides caramelize. You want them to be 
crisp and brown on the outside and tender 
within. That could take anywhere between 
15–30 minutes, depending on how much 
color you want. I think you want more.Righteous Roasted Vegetables 
(Cauliflower, Fennel, and/OR Brussels 
Sprouts)
Apparently they didn’t make these veggies back in the day because I don’t remember eating these, either. But I do recall 
those that came out of a can (carrots and peas seemed to be popular, and horrid) and others that were of the frozen variety 
(like peas, not terrible). I certainly didn’t eat cauliflower, fennel, or Brussels sprouts. That has definitely changed, due 
primarily to the revelation I had when learning about roasting them. Wow, what a difference! When caramelization kicks in, 
these vegetables get transformed into something delectable. And all you really need is some olive oil and salt. The basic 
recipe and process can be used for any root vegetable, which can be made individually, or combined with others.
Notes:
1) This is an “either/or” recipe, which is to say that you could make any of these individually or combine them. If combining 
you’ll want to cut all the veggies to approximately the same size so that they’ll be finished cooking at the same time.
2) Cauliflower can also be cut into thick slices they call “steaks” and roasted the same way. Or, and I’ve done this too (as you can 
see in the picture on page 168), you can oil, salt, and roast the entire head of cauliflower. It makes for a dramatic presentation.
You can serve them just as they are, and they’re not bad cold, either. They can also be dressed up with a splash 
of vinegar, a toss of crispy bacon bits, or a handful of toasted pine nuts, for example. Or serve with one of my 
many sauces—like red pepper, chimichurri , pesto, or gremolata —to elevate this dish even further.Short Order Dad

Roast Your Asparagus
Nothing quite says springtime eating like asparagus. Sure, you can get it year round, but the tastiest asparagus appears 
when the worst of winter is over and temperatures start to rise. Your best option is to try to locate some at a farmer’s market, 
but if you don’t have one nearby, be sure to ask the produce people in your supermarket when the asparagus arrived in the 
store and from where it came. Closer and fresher is what you’re looking for.
I generally roast asparagus these days because the caramelization they achieve from the oven makes them thoroughly 
delectable. And it’s quite easy too: Trim off the hard bottom part of the stem, which you can do by hand because they snap 
right where they’re supposed to. Then just give ’em a quick rinse, lay them in a single layer on a baking sheet, douse with 
olive oil, sprinkle on salt, and bake at 425°F until they get good and brown. Generally about 15–20 minutes.
Note:  Grated lemon zest on this before or after roasting is a win.
Who You Callin ’ Garbanzo, Chickpea?

(intuitive)
I dig me some chickpeas, also known as garbanzos, the little legumes packed with protein. Plenty of people pop ’em in 
salad, as they are, generally out of a can. Eh. For me, the real treat occurs when you roast (or toast) them. The heat not only 
develops their buttery, nutlike flavor, it gives them a slightly crunchy exterior that, combined with a tender, mellow interior, 
is an altogether winning combination. Easy-peasy to do, plus you can personalize them in innumerable ways, depending 
entirely on your own taste preferences. Ready?ˊ179

1. To clean leeks, remove any bruised 
leaves and trim the root ends, keeping 
the leaves attached. Discard the very 
fibrous upper dark green part, and 
halve the white to light green parts 
lengthwise. Completely rinse the leaves 
under cold running water, “fanning” the 
leaves to remove all dirt. Drain.
2. In a large sauté pan place leeks cut side 
down in a single layer. Add the liquid to 
about halfway up the side of the leeks. 
Season with salt and pepper to taste and 
add the oil or butter. Cover and simmer 
over low heat until the liquid has almost 
fully evaporated and the leeks are tender, 
20–25 minutes. (If necessary, add a couple 
of tablespoons of water at a time along the 
way to prevent the leeks from browning. 
Conversely, if the leeks are tender you can 
remove the cover to facilitate evaporation.) 
Do I really need to tell you what to do with 
them when they’re ready?Brilliant Braised Leeks ( Poireaux Etuv Es)
One of my favorite discoveries from French cooking school days was braised leeks, simply seasoned with salt, pepper, and 
olive oil or butter. Popular in French cuisine, the leek—along with onions, shallots, and garlic—is a member of the Alliaceae 
family. Now it’s also a member of my family. Though pungent, when slow-cooked and simmered, leeks become silky and 
sumptuous while developing a delicate sweet flavor. This classic recipe is easy to make, especially after you get past the 
rather tedious task of cleaning these dirt-laden vegetables. You’ll quickly realize that the fuss was well worth the effort when 
you take your first bite, however. A great way to impress your guests is to present the dish by its French name, poireaux 
étuvés . Serve them as a vegetable side dish to any roasted meat or seafood entrée. Or serve cold as an appetizer with my 
classic vinaigrette (page 194). Bon appétit!

“deglaze” the pan. 
5. Serve hot.Glazed Carrots
Although you could roast carrots like other root vegetables (see recipe, page 175), when you braise them simply with nothing 
more than water, oil or butter, and salt, they get soft, delectable, and naturally sweet. If you want to pump up the sweetness 
factor a bit, you can simply sprinkle on a touch of sugar. In that case, I suppose you could call them candied  carrots instead, 
a name change that I’ve learned is even more attractive to kids than glazed. Unless, of course, you’re referring to doughnuts.
Note:  Glazing is a good way to prepare any number of root vegetables, such as parsnips, turnips, celery root, and even baby 
onions.

PREPARATION
1. Preheat oven to 425°F .
2. Blanch (page 44) the string beans in 
boiling water for a couple of minutes 
to minimize their stiffness just a little. 
(They’ll also turn a vibrant green color.) 
You could skip this step and proceed 
directly to roasting them, but I find that 
this quick blanch helps to maintain a nice chew to the bean after roasting, 
rather than total crispness. (Come to 
think of it, you could also blanch or 
steam the beans until ready and skip the 
roasting step altogether.) When roasting, 
toss beans first with oil.
3. While they’re cooking, crispy  up some 
bacon. (I realize that crispy isn’t a verb, 
but it should be.)
4. Crumble it into chunky pieces, set it 
aside, and reserve the bacon fat.
5. To make the dressing, whisk together 
the gochujang, vinegar, and honey with a 
teaspoon or so of the bacon fat until well 
blended. (Because the gochujang is very 
thick, you can add more vinegar or oil 
or even a splash of water if necessary to 
thin it .) Mix in the cilantro if using. 
6. Top the string beans with the bacon and 
nuts, pour in a little dressing at a time 
(to taste), and toss the whole shebang 
together. Crazy good, am I right? Then 
take a bow, receive applause.Spicy Green Beans Gangnam Style
You might not have heard of gochujang yet, but it is becoming increasingly popular. If you like it a little spicy, 
this Korean hot chile paste is marvelous. I use it as the base of a pungent dressing for green beans, but it would 
work for many other veggies. Unlike your basic hot sauce, I find that there’s something about gochujang that 
is appealing even to those who normally shy away from the hot stuff. By balancing out the dressing with the 
addition of acidity to brighten it up and sweetness to work against the spice, you create a sweet heat that is 
pretty irresistible. Cilantro adds a dash of freshness and fragrance. Plus, when you top those green beans with 
crunchy bacon bits and a handful of nuts, you’ve got yourself a winner.

Baked Potato  Fries
I’m pretty sure that French fries would win the popularity contest for all-time favorite food in the world. I don’t 
even own a deep fryer, although you could put a lot of oil in any old deep pot and fry away. Instead, I cut potatoes 
into whatever shape feels right that day, coat them in olive oil, and toss ’em into the oven to cook until crispy and 
golden brown. They’re easier to make and much less fatty than the original way. And they’re good. Very good. 
I haven’t had anyone complain yet. Plus, you can flavor them with your favorite dried herbs and spices, like

PREPARATION
1. Peel the potatoes and grate them

or by the grating blade on the food 
processor, if you have one of those.
2. Squeeze as much liquid as possible out 
of them. A salad spinner is a start, plus 
you’ll need to squeeze a handful at a time—in paper or kitchen towel—and 
transfer to a dry bowl. Do not worry if 
the potatoes begin to discolor a bit, just 
make sure they’re well drained. Mix in 
salt, pepper, and grated onion or leek, if 
using, to combine.
3. Heat half the fat in a heavy-based frying 
pan over medium high heat until very 
hot. Carefully (as the oil will spatter) add 
a ladleful of potato at a time until all the 
potatoes are crowded in. Then press 
down by spatula or with a fork, molding 
and forming it into a flat cake that fits 
snugly into the skillet.
4. Adjust the heat so that it sizzles, 
but you do not  want the bottom 
browning too rapidly. Shake the skillet Potatoes ROsti
Some people might recognize this as the national dish of Switzerland. To me, it’s the world’s largest potato pancake. What 
makes it awesome is a totally crispy outside, covering a soft, creamy potato inside. Here’s another thing to love about this: 
No egg, no flour, no nothing. Just potatoes. Not that there’s nothing at all wrong with adding a little onion (or leek) if you have 
it around.
I don’t make these in the usual way, which would have you cook the potatoes first prior to frying. One step too many 
for me. Instead, I grate and proceed directly to frying. You have an option as to the type of fat you can use. Nothing at all 
wrong with oil or butter, or both, for that matter. But if you happen to get your hands on some duck fat (because you’ve made 
my seared duck breasts, page 106, and reserved the fat), go for the glory! Whichever fat you choose, the hotter it is before 
introducing the potatoes the better, for they will absorb less fat. But you’ll need to be very careful when plopping the potatoes 
in because they will splatter. Splattering hot oil is no fun for the entire family.
Oh, another thing: These can be made entirely on top of the stove or finished in the oven, in which case you’d need a pan 
that can be used for both. And it needs to be wide enough to hold a whole load of grated potatoes. Plus, and this is key, those 
potatoes need to be very—and I mean Sahara—well-drained and dried. Use a salad spinner, use paper towels, use a kitchen 
towel—or all three—whatever it takes to squeeze all of the excess moisture from the potatoes before cooking.̈185
A Little Something on the Sideoccasionally—you want the potatoes to 
stick to each other, not to the pan—and 
cook until the underside turns a deep 
golden brown, around 10–15 minutes. 
Using a spatula, carefully lift and check 
underneath to see that they’re good and 
crisp. At that point, slide a knife around 
the perimeter so that the potatoes are 
not stuck to the side of the pan.
5. Now comes the fun part. Don’t flip 
out, flip the potatoes. Position a plate 
facedown right on top of the potatoes. 
Holding it against the potatoes, invert 
the pan so that the potatoes slide 
out and you end up with the pancake 
sitting cooked side up on the plate. Got 
it? Good. Now spread the remaining 
fat around the pan and as soon as it’s 
hot, slide the potato cake back into it 
so that the crisp side is face up and 
the undercooked side is against the 
pan bottom. Well done. (You! Not the 
potatoes.)
6. Cook for another 10 minutes or so until 
the new bottom is also well browned 
and crispy. (The option here is that you 
could finish the cooking in the oven 
instead, in which case it should be 
preheated to 425°F , and the cooking time 
to complete will be about 10–15 minutes, 
depending on thickness.)7. If you have the nerve, carefully remove 
the whole pancake from the pan to 
present it on a platter. Alternatively, you 
could leave it in the (very hot) pan and 
slice or scoop into wedges directly from 
there. Maybe toss a little green herb on 
top, like chopped parsley or a spring of 
rosemary. (See, now you’re “plating.”) 
However you do it, you’re a hero. 
Perhaps even more so if you accompany 
it with my grandmother’s applesauce

Commonly sold from street carts, this combination of Mexican flavors makes corn tongue-tingling. The usual

correct food term. The key here is to get some char on the corn, which can be accomplished on the grill or in a 
grill pan. I like it with crumbly Mexican cheese, but you can also substitute other grated cheeses (like Parmesan) 
for a similar effect. Viva Mexico!
Note: There’s another way to play this that’s equally as enticing. After grilling the corn, slather it with a Mexican 
butter “composed” of lime and jalapeño for a kick (recipe page 209).191

I haven’t bought salad dressing in a bottle for as long as I can remember. And that’s a very long time. You’ll understand why 
there’s no reason to purchase bottled once you make your own. It’s as easy as combining oil with either vinegar or lemon 
and adding a touch of seasoning. There are a lot of variations possible, including the type of acid you use (vinegar, or lemon 
juice instead) to the type of oil (olive, canola, safflower, etc.), the choice of “aromatic” (shallot or garlic), and any additions you 
desire, like herbs or grated cheese or curry powder, for example. The proportion of oil to “acid” can also vary; some recipes 
call for as much as four times as much oil as vinegar—three-to-one is the standard, but others call for two-to-one. The point 
is that whatever ratio you use and whichever combination of flavorings you settle upon, you get to control the final product to 
your liking. Not only will you appreciate what you’ve made more than what you can find on a supermarket shelf, you’ll find 
this sprightly vinaigrette to be very versatile. Good not only on salads, but on grilled meat, fish, or vegetables.
Variations aplenty:  Once you master the basic technique, you can start to have some fun with any one of a number of 
different fats and/or vinegars. Balsamic, of course, but also try sherry wine vinegar or champagne wine vinegar. Among fats, 
walnut oil is one of the tastes to try as well. (I even deploy duck fat for the vinaigrette on page 106.) Experiment with different 
chopped herbs in your dressing, especially fresh ones like tarragon or basil.195

SALT AND PEPPER TO TASTEPREPARATION
1. Combine the shallots with the white 
wine and vinegar in a saucepan and 
gently simmer until almost  all of the 
liquid has evaporated. Add in the water, 
and if there’s any browning inside the 
saucepan wipe it away with a wet paper 
towel. (You don’t want it to discolor the 
final sauce.)
2. Over medium high heat add butter to 
the shallot mixture a little at a time, 
whisking constantly, until all the butter 
is incorporated into the mixture, and the 
texture is creamy. (Reminder: don’t let it 
boil.)
3. Add salt and pepper, then taste for 
seasoning. You can add a touch of 
vinegar if you think the sauce needs 
to be a bit brighter, or more butter if 
it seems too acidic. You can strain the 
sauce or not, depending on whether or 
not you want the shallots in the sauce. 
Use immediately over simply prepared 
fish.Beurre Blanc (White Butter Sauce)
Beurre blanc is one of those classic sauces you learn to make in French cooking school. It is a white butter 
sauce with acidity that plays perfectly against a piece of fish or with seafood. The key here is emulsification , 
which simply means that you need to whisk constantly and not let the mixture come to a boil until you produce 
one harmonious, blended sauce.Short Order Dad
196Beurre Noisette (Brown Butter Sauce)
This is some easy-peasy. Seriously, forget the recipe. Get a stick of butter—or half a stick—and start melting it 
slowly over medium heat, maybe a touch higher. Now keep going. As the water content evaporates, you’ll notice 
white solids coagulating on the surface. Turn the heat down and when that white stuff turns a pale brown, take 
the pan off the heat. Your butter has turned a bit brown, right? Good, you want that. And it smells pretty good, 
too? Kinda nutty. The smell, I’m talking about. Cool. I mean literally, let it cool down to warm before you hit it 
with a squeeze of lemon juice. (Half a lemon’s worth for half a bar of butter; the whole lemon juiced for a whole 
8-ounce bar of butter.) Congrats. You’ve just made your first beurre noisette  (“hazelnut butter”).
How to use it? Over simply prepared fish, or poached chicken, with vegetables, omelets, or pasta.197

The truth is I don’t love red pepper. I don’t hate it either. But this puree is a breeze to make, wonderful to look 
at, and serves a number of valuable purposes. You can use it as a sauce by spooning it over a cooked piece of 
fish or meat. You can cultivate your own culinary artistry by laying a pool of it down on a plate and placing foods 
atop it. You could ladle a dollop on a bowl of hearty soup. Or just serve it as is—as a dip—with some pita chips 
on the side. Fresh herbs (oregano, marjoram) can be a delightful addition; or use some of the puree in your next 
vinaigrette. In the age of multitasking, roasted red pepper puree definitely fits the bill.
FYI: You could call it by its French name, coulis (coo’ lee).

Tomatillo Salsa (Salsa Verde)
Have you ever enjoyed that green salsa that’s often served in Mexican restaurants? Well, it’s probably made with tomatillos. 
Sometimes called Mexican green tomatoes (although they’re not actually), tomatillos come with a papery covering that is 
removed before cooking. The beauty of them is their natural acidity, which is ideal in a salsa, straight up with chips, or as 
topping for most kinds of grilled meats or chicken. Although the basic ingredients are the same, there are multiple ways to 
make it. You can chop the ingredients by hand to yield a chunky salsa; you can toss everything into a blender for a smooth 
salsa (I do); or you can even stew all the ingredients before blending to end up with a smoother, richer sauce.

You get sweetness from the mango, acidity from tomato and lime juice, a little bite from onion, heat from 
jalapeño, and that added fragrant dimension from the cilantro. This stuff is so good people will want to eat it by 
the spoonful. No need to add oil, though you could. In fact, I take oil out of the equation altogether by throwing 
corn tortillas right into the oven or toaster oven until they’re nice and crisp. Then we all chip and dip away, 
without the deep-fried packaged chips.
Note:  This is a perfect recipe to hone your knife skills, so you may want to hone your knife, too. Sharp knives 
make a big difference. (And remember: don’t put good ones in the dishwasher.)203

204Cranberry Sauce Four Ways
I understand the excitement over the turkey, the stuffing, and whatever else floats your epicurean boat at the 
big affair. Me, I like a good cranberry sauce. Its sweet tartness is the perfect foil to offset all that other richness. 
But never out of a can. Sorry, that won’t play. It’s far too easy to make it yourself. Here’s the basic way and three 
alternate versions, all of which are of the chunky variety.
#1. Basic version
Makes 2¼ cups. Use fresh berries. If you have frozen, don’t defrost them; just add about 2 minutes to 
the simmering time.
INGREDIENTS
¾ CUP WATER
1 CUP GRANULATED SUGAR
¼ TEASPOON SALT
1 (12-OUNCE) BAG CRANBERRIES (RINSE, AND TOSS ANYTHING THAT AIN’T A CRANBERRY)
PREPARATION
1. Bring water, sugar, and salt to boil in medium saucepan over high heat, stirring 
occasionally to dissolve sugar.
2. Drop in the crannies and return to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and simmer 
until slightly thickened. You’ll see that most of the berries have popped open after 
about 7–8 minutes.
3. Transfer to a stainless steel or glass bowl and cool. You can cover and refrigerate for 
up to 7 days.
#2. Basic plus frozen blueberries added
For a unique and tasty addition, toss in 1 cup of frozen blueberries after the cranberries have already 
completed popping for a couple of minutes and cook for another five until everything is hot and bubbly.
#3. Cranberry sauce with pears
INGREDIENTS
¾ CUP WATER
1 CUP GRANULATED SUGAR205
Go-To Sauces and Dressings1 TABLESPOON GRATED FRESH GINGER
¼ TEASPOON GROUND CINNAMON
¼ TEASPOON SALT
1 (12-OUNCE) BAG CRANBERRIES, RINSED AND PICKED THROUGH
2 MEDIUM FIRM, RIPE PEARS, PEELED, CORED, AND CUT INTO ½-INCH CHUNKS
PREPARATION
Bring first five ingredients to boil. Stir in cranberries and pears and return to boil. Then 
simmer, and follow same process as above.
#4. Go orange!
INGREDIENTS
¾ CUP WATER
1 CUP GRANULATED SUGAR
1 TABLESPOON GRATED ORANGE ZEST
¼ TEASPOON TABLE SALT
1 (12-OUNCE) BAG CRANBERRIES, RINSED AND PICKED THROUGH
2 TABLESPOONS ORANGE LIQUEUR (TRIPLE SEC OR GRAND MARNIER)
PREPARATION
Same as above EXCEPT that you add 1 tablespoon of orange zest to the water, sugar, and 
salt AND you will add 2 tablespoons of orange liqueur AFTER you take the berries off the 
heat.
Have fun with it. I’ve used cinnamon, dry mustard, and ginger, as well as various nuts and 
dried fruits to add interesting tastes and textures. Or try ruby port instead of the orange 
liqueur.
And know that cranberries are pretty darn good for you, loaded with antioxidants and 
vitamins.207

it, but add a little more water along the 
way if the apples start to stick to the 
bottom of the pot.) 
2. Mash with a fork or potato masher, to 
whatever texture you prefer, chunky or 
smooth. Taste, and season with sugar if 
so desired. It’s good hot or cold.Mama Sherlye's Applesauce
It’s another one of those few-ingredient recipes you can make with ease rather than buy it out of a jar. Yes, it’s 
better than the bottled kind because it’s fresher and can be suited to your taste, but there is also the added 
satisfaction of having produced it yourself. So there’s that, as they say.Short Order Dad

Another fancy name, another really good accompaniment to know about. Gremolata  is a condiment typically

by throwing a full-flavor citric blast at it. It brings what they call “brightness.” You could also toss it atop roasted 
vegetables, for example. And you can also replace the lemon zest with orange zest for a change.209

1. In a pan large enough to hold the fruit

bring to boil, then reduce heat to simmer. 
2. Gently place pears into liquid, cover, and 
“poach” for about 15 minutes, turning 
pears once along the way so that both 
sides are evenly covered and cooked. 
Pears are ready when tender but not 
mushy and have taken on a beautiful 
color. Transfer pears to a plate.
3. Boil the remaining liquid, uncovered, until 
it is reduced by at least half. In fact, keep 
your eye on it and reduce it until it reaches 
a thick consistency that you like. I cook it 
down until it becomes almost a glaze. 
4. Now pour it over the pears and serve 
it as is. Or top it off with ice cream. Or 
whipped cream. Or top the ice cream 
with the syrup. Oh, you get the idea.Pure Poached Pear Pleasure
I’m eternally grateful to whoever figured out how to turn grapes into wine. It is also amazing to witness the 
transformation that takes place when you add sugar to it and heat it up. Eventually, you get syrup. But not just 
any syrup—it’s this intense, gooey, sophisticated, deep rush of grapiness . Now, imagine you could enhance that 
lusciousness even further by adding another flavor dimension to it, and then pour that velvety syrup over softly stewed 
fruit. Yeah, then make this keeper part of your repertoire and impress your people with your mad skills, rock star.
Note:  That flavor enhancement I refer to above is from liqueur and from spice. The liqueur is optional, but good if you 
have; and you have a choice on the spice mix*, in which either combo below works well.215

1 TEASPOON VANILLA EXTRACTPREPARATION
Place all ingredients into cold bowl and 
whisk on high speed using electric beaters 
or immersion blender until medium 
“peaks” form, about 1 minute. (You can also 
whisk by hand, which will take you a couple 
of minutes more.) So whip it good. But 
know that if you whip it too much, you could 
end up with something more like butter.Homemade Whipped Cream
Cool Whip is cool. Reddi-wip is ready. But it’s a piece of cake to whip up your own that’s superior to either of 
those. All you need is some form of blender. Or fast hands.
Coldness matters, so even though you could beat the cream in a glass bowl, it works very in a chilled stainless 
steel one, which should be put into the freezer about 15 minutes beforehand.
Note on “peaks”:  You’ll notice a change in the texture of the cream as you whip it. It thickens in stages called 
“peaks.” First, trails start to build up and overlap each other. Those are soft peaks. Next, medium peaks form, 
which is what most of us think of as whipped cream . . . just the kind you’d want to put atop any dessert that 
warrants it, or directly into your own pie hole. As much as the notion of “stiff peaks” might be attractive to some, 
the thickness and volume of the cream at this stage is generally reserved for spreading on cakes or for recipes 
that call for “folding” in cream.217

3. Melt the chocolate by either A) boiling 
a few inches of water in a medium-

4. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. 
Dip the berries into the chocolate, 
holding them by the stem, and set them 
onto the parchment paper. Refrigerate 
until firm. Enjoy.Chocolate-Covered Strawberries
Two ingredients to glory. Chocolate. Strawberries. That is all. Melt and dip. Now, I must tell you that there is a 
“right” temperature at which chocolate is called “tempered,” which means that it will be real smooth and shiny 
when it “sets.” But you should know that tempering is a pain in the butt and I don’t have the time, patience, or 
interest in doing it . . . IF I can just simply melt and dip without having to worry about it. That is the case here if 
you (like me) are totally fine to give up some beauteous perfection in exchange for getting it done quickly and 
quite well.
P.S. No one has ever refused my chocolate-covered strawberries because they weren’t as pretty as the five-
buck version at Godiva.
Note:  You MUST make sure that the berries are COMPLETEL Y dry before you dip them. Otherwise you’re making 
a mess. I have actually used a hair blower to dry mine. Seriously .219

Once again, allow me to present you with an incredibly lush and luscious dessert that looks impressive and complicated to 
make . . . but isn’t. The chocolate truffle. Learned to make it in cooking school and was surprised to find that it’s basically two 
ingredients: chocolate and heavy cream. So, get yourself some good quality chocolate—brands like Callebaut, Valrhona, and 
Scharffen Berger among others are very good, but you could also try packaged semisweet chocolate chips—and you will 
soon be serving your friends and family something fantastic. (And saving a buttload of money.)
Note:  Just so you know, these little chocolate delicacies look a whole lot prettier and more professional when they’re dusted 
with either cocoa powder or confectioners’ sugar, or rolled in crushed nuts. So dust ’em! Shredded coconut wouldn’t be too 
bad, either.221

¼ CUP BROWN SUGAR
6 TABLESPOONS COLD, UNSALTED BUTTER, DICED
½ CUP QUICK-COOKING OATS
½ CUP SLICED ALMONDS
⅛ TEASPOON SALTPREPARATION
1. Preheat oven to 350°F .
2. In one bowl, mix blueberries with lemon 
juice, zest, and vanilla. In another bowl, 
whisk sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon. 
Toss dry mixture with blueberries until 
evenly coated. Pour into an 8- or 9-inch 
square baking dish.
3. I like assembling the topping by hand, 
but you could also pulse a processor or 
another type of mixer. Mix flour, sugars, 
and butter until it’s coarse and crumbly, 
then add the oatmeal, almonds, and salt 
and stir until all combined.
4. Spread the topping evenly over the fruit 
and bake for about 40 minutes, until 
berries are bubbling and topping is 
golden brown. Let it cool a bit, if you can 
wait, and serve it with whipped cream, 
ice cream, or straight up.Blueberry Crumble
Making a fruit pie usually takes some patience, entails a level of know-how, and requires a little skill. My 
blueberry crumble eliminates those annoying barriers. It’s scrumptious and luxurious, yet not overly sweet. 
Uncomplicated and wanting for nothing more than a scoop of ice cream or a blast of whipped cream.Short Order Dad

INGREDIENTS
1 POUND BEST -QUALITY CHOCOLATE (60–70 PERCENT CACAO), CHOPPED INTO SMALLISH CHUNKS
2 STICKS UNSALTED BUTTER PLUS ABOUT 2 TABLESPOONS MORE FOR “GREASING”
6 EGGS
PREPARATION
1. While you preheat your oven to 425°F , also bring a few inches of water to a simmer in a 
medium saucepan. Grab some of that “extra” butter and “grease” your new springform 
pan (meaning to spread the soft butter around the pan with your fingers or a paper 
towel or, ideally, with the very wrapping paper that the butter comes in). Now line that 
pan with parchment paper. So far, so good.
2. Melt the chocolate and two sticks of butter in a metal or glass heatproof bowl over 
your simmering water. Turn off the water when all melted, but you can let it rest there 
warmly for the next few minutes.
3. Believe it or not, we need another bowl, and more simmering water. The eggs go into a 
bowl, the bowl goes over the simmering water, and you whisk them until they begin to 
thicken (maybe 3–5 minutes). At that point, take them off the heat, but continue to beat 
them for another five minutes. Really.
4. Time to blend the eggs with the melted chocolate butter. Put half of the egg mixture 
into the chocolate and don’t whip it, but more gently “fold” it in, yet still incorporating Serious Chocolate Cake
It’s truly astounding to behold what creation is possible using only chocolate, butter, and eggs. In this case, it is an intense, 
dense, and decadent cake made without flour or added sugar. (So if you have any chocolate-loving, gluten-free friends 
and family, they’ll surely appreciate this.) Not quite as easy as it may sound, but well worth the attempt when you’re ready. 
Ready? Okay, let me walk you through this one step by step. . . .
Note:  By the way, you’re going to want to use what’s called a “springform” pan for this one, ideally a 10-inch, because they 
spring open, which allows for an easy release of the dense cake.233
The Sweet Stuffthoroughly. (A soft, rubber spatula is good for this, by the way.) Now fold in the other 
half of the eggs. Doing great.
5. Pour that beauteous batter evenly into your pan and cover it with a piece of aluminum 
foil that you will have buttered so that it won’t stick to the batter.
6. One last key step: using probably all of that water you have had simmering, and 
then some, you are going to create a bath for your cake pan. So put the cake pan into 
a baking dish (or roasting pan) with high sides and fill it with enough hot water  to 
come halfway up the cake pan.  Seriously. (Incidentally, you have just made an official 
“bain-marie.”)
7. Bake for five minutes, then remove the foil and continue baking for 10 minutes longer. 
By that point, you should see that it “sets,” meaning “to firm” in the pan. When it does, 
take it out of the hot water bath and let it sit until it cools completely. Then you can 
spring it open . . . slice it . . . top it off with a dollop of fresh whipped cream . . . and 
marvel at your bad self.

I was taken by how great this was the very first time I had it . . . and how surprisingly simple. Just hot espresso 
poured over vanilla ice cream. ( Affogato  means drowned  in Italian.) The result is cold, creamy, bittersweet, and 
delectable. Although you could leave it at that, I’m big on “gilding the lily.” In this case, that means adding a little 
something something over the top. I like toffee, so I crunch up a bit of Heath bar or Skor and scatter it on. (Or 
try Biggie’s Crack Toffee if you can.) You could also shave chocolate on, or top it with chopped (candied, page 81) 
nuts. As they say, it’s all good.235

I wonder whether the admonition to “drink responsibly” is an oxymoron. Let’s face it: don’t we already 
have enough responsibility in our lives? Job. Customers. Kids. Decisions. Paying bills. Making deadlines. 
Watching your weight. Mowing the lawn. Filling the tank. Initiating foreplay. Then there’s moral responsibility, 
civic responsibility, and fiduciary responsibility. Aren’t there times when you just want to say to hell with 
responsibility? Well, those times often call for a drink. 
Yet you can’t even do that without being constantly reminded by every single ad for beer, wine, or booze to 
“drink responsibly.” Well, I’ve got news—the last thing I want to be when I’m drinking . . . is responsible. All this 
responsibility is half the reason for drinking in the first place.
I’m not advocating inebriation. Or irresponsibility. I’m merely suggesting that even perfectly law-abiding 
and otherwise responsible grownups have every right to enjoy the occasional adult beverage without guilt. (Just 
NEVER drive.) So if you’re bothered by assorted ills, angsts, nagging negativity, or you’re just in the mood for a 
good old cocktail, here are five you should know how to make. CHAPTER FOURTEEN

For Adults Only.

238The Martini
Married with children, you’re looking for a little levity with a soigné facade. To be enjoyed with company or solo, 
the martini is a sophisticated cocktail. There is something genuinely cool about it too—the ritual, the shape of 
the glass, the purity of the liquid, interrupted only by glorious green olives. A drink for adults, its whole gestalt 
says, “this is not for kids, I’m a big boy now.”
The original, classic version is made with British gin, just an eyedrop or two of dry vermouth, straight up, 
ice cold, olives and a twist, (so you can eat while you drink). Make it vodka if you must, but know that any ’tini 
made with watermelon, kiwi, chocolate, or anything other than gin or vodka is not a martini, it’s a high-octane, 
Technicolor dessert. For purists like me, gin is the choice. And one is enough as there’s something about that 
spirit’s almost hallucinogenic effectiveness that makes everything else seem like mother’s milk. Remember, 
there’s a fine line between dirty martinis and nasty divorce. Speaking of which, if I want dirt in my food, I’ll eat it 
directly from the ground. Dirty is for sex, not martinis.
“I like to have a martini,
Two at the very most.
After three I’m under the table,
 After four I’m under my host.”
—Dorothy Parker
Oh, one more thing: there is a version of the martini known as a Vesper martini that I adore. Rather than choosing 
between gin and vodka, the Vesper uses both. And rather than vermouth, it calls for Lillet Blanc, a perfectly fruity and 
fragrant aperitif that makes this cocktail the favorite of James Bond. And me.239

martini-type glass. Olé!Margarita
Everything is getting on your nerves. Your boss. Traffic. The nightly news. Taxes. You might consider tequila.
Tequila can be calming or corrupting, depending on how you want to play it. You can sip a smoky Don Julio 
Reposado to calm your nerves, soothe your stomach, and awaken your sense of adventure. At least that’s how 
it starts. How it ends depends on your appetite for adventure. Too much tequila invariably leads to enthusiastic, 
wild-eyed mischief, followed by outrageous behavior, and then, generally, a misdemeanor.
There always seems to be an element of danger associated with tequila. I suspect that often derives from 
that first college trip to Cancún, when you go to some place with a name like Carlos’n Charlie’s, where the 
waiters come along to your table with a type of elongated flask-like device, and inject a dose or two of cheap 
tequila down your gullet, returning repeatedly, until, perhaps, you find yourself semiconscious, with your pants 
around your ankles, in a Mexican whorehouse, yelling for your mama.
Jokes aside, you already know how good a margarita is. It has that classic combo of sweet and sour that 
supports (and perhaps masks) the taste of tequila. Although generally made with an orange liqueur, one of 
the best I ever had was at an authentic Mexican restaurant in Southern California. So I asked the bartender for 
the recipe. Lo and behold—no orange liqueur. She used agave instead, and her tequila of choice was Chinaco 
Blanco. Viva Mexico!Short Order Dad
242SERVES 2
INGREDIENTS
1 JUICY LIME, CUT INTO 16 PIECES, WHITE PITH 
REMOVED
2–3 TABLESPOONS GRANULATED SUGAR
4–6 OUNCES CACHAÇA (OR VODKA)
ICE CUBESPREPARATION
1. In a rocks glass, use a “muddler” or 
wooden spoon to mash together half 
the lime pieces with half the sugar, 
extracting as much juice as possible to 
produce a “syrup.”
2. Add 2–3 ounces of cachaça and stir 
well to incorporate all of the ingredients 
together.
3. Fill with ice and enjoy.Caipirinha
For all you do, you’re feeling a little unappreciated, even unloved. Say hello to the Caipirinha. From over fifty trips 
to Brazil, three things stand out in my mind: grilled hearts of palm, sultry women, and caipirinhas, the potently 
sexy national cocktail. Made of only lime, sugar, and cachaça, the spirit distilled from sugarcane, capirinha 
literally translates into “little hillbilly.” But think of it as liquid love. So be careful, for the first sip may surprise 
you, yet as you continue to stir the lime sugar syrup you’ll soon discover that these things go down like a baby’s 
butt on a waterslide.
Saúde!
Note: Go ahead and make it with vodka if you don't have cachaça; then you've got yourself a caipiroska instead.243

1 BOTTLE OF DRY WINE, RED OR WHITE (E.G., 
SPANISH RIOJA IS GOOD, AS IS PINOT GRIGIO)
½ CUP BRANDY OR COGNAC (FOR RED SANGRIA) OR 
VODKA, FRUIT -FLAVORED OR NOT (FOR WHITE)
¼ CUP ORANGE LIQUEUR OR PEACH SCHNAPPS
2–4 TABLESPOONS SUGAR (GRANULATED OR 
SUPERFINE), OR TO TASTE
SELTZER, CLUB SODA, OR SPRITE FOR TOPPING OFF
ICE CUBES FOR SERVINGPREPARATION
1. Place fruit in a small pitcher; add 
everything else except for sparkling 
beverage and ice.
2. Stir well to combine, making sure to 
dissolve sugar, and chill for as long as 
overnight. 
3. Pour into ice-filled glasses, making sure 
to include some fruit, and top with a shot 
of sparkling beverage.Sangria
You’re out on a date, and you want to bring her home late, to sin. It could start with sangria. First of all, it’s 
generally consumed by the pitcher. And what a tasty-looking pitcher it is, filled with chilled, purple-colored 
grape juice and charming chunks of fruit floating about. What you may not know is that it ain’t just cheap red 
wine—it’s red wine spiked with brandy or rum or any other flammable intoxicant a bartender needs to move. 
Then it’s polished off with sweet liqueur, such as Grand Marnier, and a splash of carbonation. 
So it’s fruit punch with a punch, which also makes it ideal for a gathering of adults. You don’t need a great 
bottle of wine; a decent one will do. Variations abound: you can make it red or white, choose from an array of 
fruits to include, bump up the booze factor, adjust the sweetness as desired, and even bring it some bubbly. The 
ingredients are basic; how much you use of each is up to you.Short Order Dad

3. Enjoy with warm quesadillas (page 91) 
and mango tomato salsa (page 202). 
Invite me to that party.Mojito
You’re looking for a reason to celebrate something. How about the fact that we’ve now resumed relations with 
Cuba? Let’s make mojitos. 
The Cuban classic features the fragrance of mint and the bright flavor of lime, balanced by a bit of 
sweetness and a touch of fizz. All good, as they say. You’ll need to do a little “muddling,” the fancy way of saying 
mashing together the ingredients. Don’t have a muddler? Use whatever works, like a fork. As you serve it, 
mention to your friends you’re no longer a bartender; now you’d like to be referred to as a mixologist.One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.
