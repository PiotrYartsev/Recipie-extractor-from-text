unraveled a discovery oftremendous historical significanceon this day in 1923 when he andhis ragtag team of archaeologistscracked the tomb of Egypt’sPharaoh Tutankhamen, known tothe rest of us simply as King Tut.A young and impetuous ruler ina time of civil unrest, Tut wasn’tlong for the throne and died atage 18 of mysterious causes. Themoral of his story: Don’t allowyourself to become entombed inthe politics that surround youand wrapped up in other people’sproblems, or you too might findyourself all alone in a bind.Today, try wrapping yourselfaround The Mummy in honor ofKing Tut, who lived and diedlong before a minimum-agerequirement for drinking went into effect.
THE MUMMY

Mix vodka, T riple Sec, and lemon juice
in an old-fashioned glass half-filledwith ice. T op off with club soda. Stir.Ah, the ’70s. Sex and drugs and
rock ’n’ roll, baby! (Never mind thehideous hair, clothes, and avocado-colored appliances.) But bythe end of the decade, the partyingtimes took their toll. Just thinkabout poor Sid Vicious, née JohnSimon Ritchie. Bass player for theSex Pistols, one of the greatest andbest-known punk bands, he fell inlove with Nancy Spungen. Theyhad sex. They did drugs. Theywere rock ’n’ roll! Unfortunately, allgood things come to an end. Justask Nancy. You see, in a drug-induced haze, Sid stabbed her. Todeath. He went on trial on thisdate in 1979. While out on bail, hedied of an overdose of heroin.Have a drink—the Red Hot Lover,described below—and be thankfulyou are comfy in your flannel pj’s and well-chosen investmentportfolio.

2001, Congress certi-fied George W. Bush as the winner of the 2000 presidential election. How doesCongress decide such a thing?Florida’s race was too close to calldue to some malfunctioning bal-lots. Chads, the things we didn’teven know about till 2000, wereto blame. It seems that many vot-ers just didn’t have the physicalstrength to push a chad out of itsslot on the ballot. Thousands ofvotes were deemed invalid;recounts were undertaken, butthe Supreme Court put a stop tothem. This, in essence, gaveFlorida’s electoral votes to Bush,and Congress ratified the electionresults. Bush defeated Al Goreand became the new president,and the rest is history.

You see, William RandolphHearst, America’s most powerfulmedia tycoon in the nineteenthand early twentieth centuries,allegedly had an affair. Her namewas . . . well, that’s not the point.It’s the alleged nickname for her,um, how do we put this delicately. . . the nickname for her “deli-cates” that got the attention:Rosebud. Eventually, news of thealleged affair got out, and a moviewas made that included this andother unflattering informationabout Mr. Hearst. Anyhoo, Citizen
Kane, written, produced, directed

citizens began looking at cigarsdifferently, thanks to a young,vivacious White House internnamed Monica Lewinsky.Among other acts, President Bill Clinton had used a cigar as a sort of tobacco phallus.

At first, PresidentClinton proclaimed his innocence.Congress didn’t buy it and beganimpeachment hearings on thisdate in 1999.

For millions of Americans, the
phrase “black gold, Texas tea”immediately evokes a mental pic-ture of Jed, Granny, Jethro, andEllie Mae, the Clampetts from the ’60s sitcom The Beverly
Hillbillies . You see, one day Jed
was shooting at a rabbit, or someother such varmint, and missed.Missed in the sense that the targetescaped, but struck in the sensethat oil started bubbling upthrough the ground. TheClampetts “hit it big,” becomingrich off of the oil they discovered.They moved to Beverly Hills andswam in their ce-ment pond.Likewise, on this date in 1901, oilwas struck in Beaumont, Texas,marking what historians call thestart of the modern oil industry.We don’t know how manyBeaumontians eventually movedto Beverly Hills, but we’re certainthat drinking a shot of BlackGold will make you feel betterabout your own impoverishedstate. Enjoy!

Be that as itmay, today’s drink, the TequilaCanyon, is pretty good, too. And you don’t have to drive to Flagstaff to see one!

On this date in 1971, All in 
the Family debuted on CBS. It
starred Carroll O’Connor asArchie Bunker, perhaps the best-known sitcom character of thedecade. He was a curmudgeonly,misogynistic, racist, homophobicanti-Semite, but, God, we lovedhim! He represented the changesthat the white middle class wasfacing during the tumultuoustimes of the civil rights move-ment and the fight over the ERA.His spouse, Edith, a good-heartedTammy Wynette-esque housewife,was the voice of reason, thoughthat voice was a combina-tion of Screech Monkeyand Long Island mother-in-law. She accepted thechanges happeningaround her, so let’sdrink to her honor! The recipe for an Edith’s Fizz follows.

24American h istory 
is rife with stories of
scrappy immigrants, arriving withnothing more than a few penniesin their pockets, working hardand making something of them-selves, and leading to a life ofriches. This is not one of thosestories. But, it’s darn close! Yousee, one such immigrant, CarlosPonzi, arrived in the United Stateson this date in 1896. After tryingbut failing to earn an honest buck,he developed a scheme to makemoney: Investors turned over theirmoney to him, and they wouldreceive the initial investment and a50 percent profit in three months’time. As people heard of this too-good-to-be-true story, they flockedto Ponzi to invest. His originalinvestors were paid on time, fuel-ing the intrigue and interest. As itturns out, Ponzi was paying theoriginal investors with the moneycoming from the newer investorswhile holding on to some of thecash himself. The plan, dubbedthe Ponzi scam, or “pyramid”scheme, works as long as thereare fresh investors and no oneasks too many questions. People
did ask questions, however, asPonzi’s fame spread; they wereespecially intrigued by his lavishlifestyle, including owning one ofthe largest homes in the Bostonarea and being driven to and froby his chauffeur. He was even-tually caught and deported toItaly. At least he had a little sliceof that immigrant’s rags-to-richeslife before returning home. Let’shope we never suffer such a fateas we try the shot below!

Thomas Nast was probably the
most famous cartoonist of histime, mostly for the editorialillustrations he produced forHarper’s W eekly . He took 
advantage of social and politicalissues, and his artistic talent wasmatched by his wit. On this date in 1870, Nast depicted theDemocratic party as a “jackass”kicking a lion, who representedAbraham Lincoln’s Secretary ofWar, Edwin M. Stanton. Fromwhence did Nast obtain the don-key? Well, it was a reference bor-rowed from Andrew Jackson,whose critics frequently calledhim a jackass while he was run-ning for president many yearsprior. Nast appreciated the stub-born trait of the donkey, and thepolitical symbol was born. Theirony is that the animal hasnever been officially adopted bythe Democrats! Why, we won-der? As you try to reason out an answer, try the “ass” below.

Exploiting the opium trade to
fund your government could earnyou a big chunk of land in a foreign country. You see, GreatBritain found that trading inopium was very profitable in theearly 1800s. But British merchantsweren’t satisfied with the supplyfrom India, so, they start-ed buying from theChinese. The Chinesegovernment, however,had begun outlawing thesale of opium. It intervened, andBritish warships were called in,leading to the First Opium War.The British easily overwhelmedthe Chinese, ransacked the localcountryside, and forced theChinese government to pay $15million to the British government.Lastly, on this date in 1840, HongKong was ceded to the British.That will show you for notwanting to sell drugs!

Do you ever have trouble making
a decision? You ask your friendsif you should date that newguy/gal in accounting, what toeat at the new restaurant aroundthe corner, and whether youshould wear that new burka tothe Fourth of July parade. Thesethings are okay, because you arenot the leader of a country, andthe advice given to you probablywon’t cost you your life. (Let’shope your friends said “no” tothe burka.) Back in the mid-eighteenth century, the king ofFrance, Louis XVI, was not solucky; he had a knack for askingthe wrong people for advice.Instead of listening to “the peo-ple” or court ministers, who hadat least an inkling of what thecommon folk needed, Louisrelied on his wife. MarieAntoinette urged Louis to forgetthe agreements he had madewith the revolutionaries whoproposed modernizing theFrench government, includingdecreasing the power of themonarchy. Revolutionaries,apparently, don’t like to be toyed with. They arrested Louis,tried him, and executed him onthis date in 1793. They eventuallyrealized that his bride should
bear some responsibility, andMarie Antoinette followed Louisto the guillotine the next year.Poor Louis! Try the King’s Ruinbelow as you contemplate whattough decisions you have, um,er, a-head of you.

Unlike the monarch listed on
January 21, Queen Victoria diedof natural causes on this date in1901. She was Britain’s longest-reigning monarch, and ruledduring a time when England’spreeminence—on the seas and inglobal politics—was never doubt-ed. Another interesting factabout Vicky, however, is that shemarried her first cousin, Albert.At first she sought other poten-tial suitors, but found none suit-able. Albert, who was German,seemed the most appropriatespouse because he was highlyeducated. He ended up beingindispensable in dispensingadvice (unlike Marie Antoinette),and acted as Victoria’s chief advi-sor and confidante. Try theQueen’s Cousin, below.

“Candy is

–OGDEN NASH Finally, in the new millennium,
women are treated as equals!Equal access to jobs, equal payfor the same jobs, and all-aroundrespect is earned by men andwomen equally. Have youstopped laughing yet? Indeed.Well, it’s important to note that,while the ladies aren’t all theway there yet, they have crossedmany milestones. One of thosemilestones was reached on thisdate in 1849, when ElizabethBlackwell became the firstwoman in the United States tobe granted a medical degree.Congrats, ladies!

Dot.com bubble, anyone? In similar fashion, people rushed toSacramento, California, on thisdate in 1848, when gold was dis-covered by James Marshall whilehe was working in a sawmillowned by John Sutter. As withmost stories about easily foundwealth, this did not end happilyfor either man. They both endedlife without the riches that werereaped by the other gold-seekerswho followed them.

What we have learned so far
while writing this book: 1.Drinks taste good and make usfeel good, and 2. the “easy wayout” frequently is the illegal wayout! On this date in 1960, theNational Association ofBroadcasters (NAB) finally beganto deal with the payola scandal.What the Elvis-Presley-gyrating-hips is that, you ask? It seems,back in the day, that radio discjockeys were taking money, a.k.a.bribes, to play records (thoseblack round discs that camebefore CDs and cassettes—weknow, they’re hard to imagine,but try to keep up). The public,in turn, would buy the albums(the other word for record—again, try to keep up) and makethe record companies rich.Apparently, some people foundthis unethical; the NAB institut-ed fines to stop the practice. Afew DJs, Alan Freed the mostfamous of them, were financiallyruined as they were banishedfrom the industry. Thankfully,you’ve never taken a gift from a client or patron to “help them out.” Have a DJ Shooter,described here, and play your favorite song.DJ SHOOTER

While growing up,
we considered theTV our third parent,except that the TV couldn’tmake us do homework orsmack our little behinds whenwe were fresh! On this date in1926, the first demonstration ofTV took place. This, contrary topopular (American) belief, tookplace in London. A Scotsman bythe name of John Logie Bairdshared his new invention withthe Royal Institution of GreatBritain. Surprisingly, Baird’s fel-low scientists were said to bevery impressed, despite the factthat the telly only had oneshow—no Seinfeld , no Real W orld

3 oz iced tea

Mix the iced tea and vodka over ice 
in a Collins glass. Now you’ll havesomething to do during commercials!Some of the best drinks happen
by accident. Take, for example,the gin and tonic. The subconti-nent known as India had beenruled by the British since thebeginning of the seventeenthcentury. Leaving a humid, rainyisland for a more humid part ofthe earth had it problems for theBritish, beyond profuse sweatingand a language barrier. The Britsalso had to deal with malaria.To protect themselves, theEnglish ingested quinine, whichwas found in tonic water; ginwas added for taste and to actu-ally lure the Brits into drinkingthe malaria-fighter. Perhaps allthis gin-and-tonic drinking ledthe British to be a bit morerelaxed: On this date in 1950, theRepublic of India became a sov-ereign nation. Have a gin andtonic to celebrate your ownindependence!

Few poems are as well known
as “The Raven” by Edgar AllanPoe, which was first publishedon this date in 1845. The poemwas even used on a Simpsons
episode, with the part of theraven played by Bart. Our friend Edgar apparently had his issues—with depression, with drug use, and even, gulp, with the drink. Tortured artist,anyone? Despite his issues, hiswriting—both nonfiction andpoetry—did garner him somewealth and international recogni-tion. “The Raven” especiallywon him national acclaim—not adreary event for Poe, we’re bet-ting! Eventually, his “issues” wonout; he was found delirious in aBaltimore gutter, and died at theage of 40. Drink the Black BirdCider, below, and then try torecite this famous work by Poe.

On this day in 1962, the Soviet
Union exchanged capturedAmerican U-2 pilot Francis GaryPowers for Rudolph IvanovichAbel, a Soviet spy held by theUnited States.  Although we’reguessing there was intrigue outthe wazoo, scrambled messages,deals made in dark Russian base-ments and deep inside the wallsof the CIA, all we can think is:Moscow in February? IvanovichAbel was the one making thetrue sacrifice by going back.Warm yourself with a nice cock-tail, and think about poor, shiv-ering Rudy. Home is home nomatter how cold it gets.

What to say about Thomas
Edison, who was born on thisday in 1847? Besides completingonly three months of formaleducation, he was, apparently,what’s the scientific term for it?Oh, yes: a total freaking genius.Not only did the Father ofInvention invent the lightbulb,but he also was responsible forcreating the first economicallyviable model for generating anddistributing electric light andpower worldwide. That said,take this opportunity to revel inthe moment when you thoughtyou had invented a patentablelint remover by wrapping a rollof scotch tape backwards aroundyour hand. While you do that,try this drink . . . that we didnot invent.

I didcut it with my little hatchet.”Faced with similar challengesthroughout history, subsequentpresidents have not been quite so forthright.

Other hobbies of Colt’sincluded running with scissors,playing with poisonous spiders,and sticking forks into poweroutlets. No, wait—power outletsdidn’t come along for anothercouple of years. In honor ofColt’s crowning patent, pull outthe shaker and stare down the barrel of this gun.

weren’t a witch living in Salem,Massachusetts, in the early days. On this date in 1692, theWitch Hunt began, more or lessbecause television hadn’t beeninvented yet. Two young girls,Elizabeth Parris and AbigailWilliams, were bored. For enter-tainment, they would listen toscary stories told by Tituba, aservant who worked in theirhome. They began acting out, incrazy fashion, twitching theirarms and legs erratically and say-ing inappropriate things. Theirmalady spread to some of theirgirlfriends. The adults whoencountered them blamed witch-craft. The girls were encouragedto inform the adults as to whowas responsible. The girls namedTituba. She was apprehended,and she in turn was encouragedto name fellow witches to escapeexecution. Witch-hunting feverbroke out, as neighbors startedaccusing one another. In all, 150were named, many were jailed,1072-103_even_m3.qxd  3/6/06  12:11 PM  Page 723    3

On this date in 1958, Nikita
Khrushchev became the Sovietpremier, the first Russian rulersince Stalin to hold that positionand the title of Soviet FirstSecretary at the same time. Whatdoes that mean? Well, he wasabsolute leader of the USSR, tak-ing charge of the national govern-ment and the Communist Party.To his benefit, he promulgateddramatic changes to social andfiscal policy, frequently reversingStalin’s iron-fisted dictatorialmethods. The Russian economyimproved, and gulags decreasedin number. Khrushchev had trou-ble shaking a somewhat boorishreputation, however; he interrupt-ed several speeches at the U.N.by banging his fist—or even hisshoe—on a table. He approvedthe nuclear missile program inCuba, which led to the crisisJFK faced. One of his mostfamous lines was “We willbury you,” implying thatSoviet military technologywas superior to that of theUnited States. Eventually, eventhe Soviets couldn’t put up withhis outbursts, and they unseatedhim. He spent the last sevenyears of his life under house072-103_Odd_m3.qxd  3/6/06  12:51 PM  Page 993    3

Nuclear accidents can be such

Onthis date in 1979, the Three MileIsland “incident” occurred,known since then as the worstaccident in U.S. nuclear powerhistory. Apparently, mechanicalfailure caused an increase inpressure in one of the reactors.A valve was opened to alleviatethe pressure. The valve remainedopen, and coolant leaked out ofthe reactor. This caused the coreto overheat. A portion of thereactor suffered a meltdown. On-site personnel misread the gaugesand other measuring whoozi-whatzits and exacerbated theproblem.

animals breathed a huge sigh ofrelief on this day in2348 b.c.e., when the cruise shipthey were on (also known asNoah’s Ark) finally landed on Mt.Ararat after a 40-day cruise whereit rained the whole time.According to the daily news (alsoknown as the Bible), Noah was600 years old when God toldhim to build the Ark, collect hisfamily and two of every animal,and ride out the coming storm.We thought, that’s some job for a600-year-old man and wonderedhow we’d fare with a similartask. We decided to put ourselvesto the test. Our combined age is71, the toy boat we made out ofPopsicle sticks sank the minutewe put it into the tub, and thecat ate the chinchilla. So insteadwe’re sticking to what we dobest: drinking!

The gay playwright, poet, and
short-story writer Oscar Wildewas arrested in London for grossindecency on this day in 1895.“Gross indecency” was a euphe-mism used to describe any sexu-al act between men.Homosexuality was illegal at thetime, but that didn’t stop Wildefrom engaging in several trysts.During the trial, Wilde gave animpassioned speech on “the lovethat dare not speak its name,” inwhich he said: “It is beautiful, itis fine, it is the noblest form ofaffection . . . That it should beso, the world does not under-stand.”  So raise your glass toWilde today and do something alittle gay!

Today is a special day: the birth-
day of the namesake of thatinstitution where you might beheading if you’ve made it this farin the book. On April 8, 1918,former first lady Betty Ford wasborn. After her years in theWhite House, poor Betty wasoften left alone as hubby and ex-prez Gerry Ford pursued hisinterests—politics, lectures, andgolf (mostly golf). Betty keptherself busy with her newfriends: Jack Daniels, Moet &Chandon, and Jose Cuervo. In 1978, family and friends stagedan intervention. Her experiences led her to create theBetty Ford Treatment Center inRancho Mirage, California. Letthis be a lesson to you if you’restill with us: hide your drinkingfrom the family! It will makethings easier in the long run.
BETTY FORD COCKTAIL
1/2oz grenadine
11/2oz citrus-flavored vodka
1 0 oz Sprite
Add the grenadine (based on desired
sweetness) into a Collins glass, fol-lowed by the vodka. Add ice and thenSprite (this is how Betty liked it). 
GLASS: CollinsIt was on April
9, 1926, that theman whom mostred-blooded Americanmen consider the luckiest personalive was born. Hugh Hefnerstarted his magazine, Playboy , in
1953. Playboy flaunted sexuality at
a time when most Americansblushed to talk about such things.Issue number one included anow-famous photo of MarilynMonroe, and quickly sold out.Playboy became a smashing suc-cess, and Hef became a celebrity.Hef’s cadre of scantily cladwomen, known as PlayboyBunnies, has caused the biggeststir and most speculation over theyears. We mixed up today’s con-coction in Hef’s honor.

The American
space program’s first
brush with disaster was with theApollo 13 mission, which waslaunched on April 11, 1970. Themission was planned as a lunarlanding mission, but it wasaborted en route after about 56hours of flight due to loss ofservice module cryogenic oxygenand the consequent loss of capa-bility to generate electrical power.There were explosions, loss ofair and water, and external dam-age to the ship. In short, theywere in trouble. MacGyver-like,however, the astronauts patchedthings up, hightailed it home,and splashed down in the ocean as planned.

The Irish Easter
Uprising, alsocalled the EasterRebellion, began onthis day in 1916 in Dublin,Ireland. Leaders of the IrishRepublican Brotherhood and thenationalist Irish Volunteersplanned the insurrection againstBritish rule. Claiming the postoffice and other high-profile loca-tions within the city, the insur-rectionists read aloud a procla-mation announcing the birth ofthe Irish Republic. Although theuprising was suppressed, Britain’sexecution of the insurrectionleadeers became powerful propa-ganda for Ireland. The event isviewed as an important steppingstone in Ireland’s struggle forindependence.

Today is the birthday of
Argentina’s most powerful firstlady of all time. Eva Perón wasborn on this day in 1919 to apoor family in a village outsideof Buenos Aires. She rose tofame through acting, and metArgentina’s future president JuanPerón at a fund-raising event inthe capital city. Their climb topower was a struggle, but luckilythey were able to stop and cata-log it through catchy songs alongthe way.  Or at least, that’s howit happens in the world ofAndrew Lloyd Webber. Evita, asshe was called, is perhaps bestremembered for her impassionedspeeches. Some of our favoritequotes are as follows:“When the rich think about the poor, 
they have poor ideas.”
“ Answer violence with violence. 
If one of us falls today, five of them must fall tomorrow.”

Before the “morning after pill”
was ever even dreamt up, thebirth control pill heralded a revo-lution of its own.  On this dayin 1960, the Food and DrugAdministration approved “thepill,” thereby freeing men of anysort of responsibility for protec-tion whatsoever and sentencingwomen to a daily dosage thatdoes everything from whackingout the hormones to contributingto odd weight-control issues.Good times for everybody!Despite its shortcomings, the pillis still considered one of themost effective forms of birth con-trol around. It certainly beatswithdrawal.

He earned hisnickname “Stonewall” after thebattle of Bull Run, where, as hepromised, he stood like a stonewall against the enemy. He wasby many accounts a very strangeman, and often behaved so oddlythat his sanity was called intoquestion. He died during theCivil War due to complicationsfrom an arm amputation thatresulted from a case of mistakenidentity leading to friendly fire.His dying words were: “Let uscross the river and rest in theshade of the trees.” We’re hopingour dying words will be equallypoignant, but we’re guessing theywill be more on par with: “Justone more sip won’t kill me . . .”

Salvador Felip Jacint Dalí
Domènech, aka Salvador Dalí,was born on this day in 1904.Perhaps the most famous surreal-ist painter of all time, Dalí’swork is noted for its strikingcombination of bizarre, dreamlikeimages with excellent draftsman-ship and artistic skills clearlyinfluenced by the Renaissancemasters. Melting watches, whydidn’t we think of that? He hadan admitted love of doing unusu-al things to draw attention tohimself. Other famous artistswho do unusual things to drawattention to themselves includeJanet Jackson (see February 1),Pee-Wee Herman, and, of course,George Michael. Oh, Salvador,maybe you should reconsider“unusual things”; just the ideapaints you in a bad light. “Paintsyou,” get it?

delightful chat
Of this and thatAnd cocktails for two
As we enjoy a cigarette
T o some exquisite chansonnetteT wo hands are sure to slyly 
meet beneath
A servietteWith cocktails for twoMy head may go reeling
But my heart will be obedientWith intoxicating kissesFor the principal ingredient
Most any afternoon at five
W e’ll be so glad we’re both aliveThen maybe fortune will complete 
her plan
That all beganWith cocktails for two

On the afternoon
of May 13, 1981, Pope
John Paul II was struck by threebullets while being driven in aslow-moving convertible throughSt. Peter’s Square, where 20,000people had gathered to see thepontiff. Rushed to a hospital, thePope barely survived a six-houroperation. The would-be assassin,a 23-year-old Turkish man namedMehmet Ali Agca, was immedi-ately apprehended. In his pocket,the police found several notes,one of which read: “I am killingthe Pope as a protest against theimperialism of the Soviet Unionand the United States and againstthe genocide that is being carriedout in El Salvador andAfghanistan.” (We suspect theother two notes said, “Hey, thegays aren’t that bad” and“Abstinence may work foryou, but come on, give usa break!”) The silver cloudbehind the assassination attemptwas the invention of thePopeMobile, the bulletproof-glassgolf cart that the Pope ridesaround in these days. It alonecalls to mind more jokes thanwe have room to print here.13ANGRY CATHOLIC

love kind, good
people, we’re not
too proud to admit
that we love evil bitches evenmore. I mean, come on, whodoesn’t? One of our favorites isbad girl Joan Collins, who wasborn on this day in 1933. Joanplayed two characters that areespecially close to our hearts.The first was in the Batman
series from the ’60s, where sheplayed The Siren, a woman whocould put men under her spellby singing a note three octavesabove a high C. She would usemen for her needs, and thenhad no problem getting rid ofthem. She once uttered thewords: “I want to become thewickedest woman in GothamCity and thus in the World!”Our second favorite Collins role is, of course, as AlexisCarrington on Dynasty , where
she made the Wicked Witch ofthe West look like ShirleyTemple. In honor of Miss Joanand one of her all-too-commonmoves on Dynasty, we’ve chosena very special drink.23134-165_Odd_m3.qxd  3/6/06  11:45 AM  Page 157p158 textJob no:70359 Title : FW-The Daily Cooktail Client : Pro-vision

Turns out there’s no air atthe top of the world. So inspiredwere we by their accomplishment(and that of nearly 1,500 peoplesince then) that we thought for aminute we’d try and climbEverest too, but then we remem-bered we don’t even like to climbthe stairs, so we made a drinkinstead.

Backto prison. In 1994, he went backto Russia and disappeared, againresurfacing two years later as ashoe salesman in Moscow.

The coronation of Queen
Elizabeth II took place on thisdate in 1953. It was the first coro-nation to be televised; this wasdone at the request of theQueen, and was indicative of thegreat sea of changes the Queenwould encounter during hermore than fifty years (so far) ofruling the BritishCommonwealth. Some of thesechanges were noteworthy, suchas the Beatles ushering in the eraof Rock ’n’ Roll, peace inNorthern Ireland, and the build-ing of the Chunnel.Unfortunately, Lizzie has alsohad to endure the scandal ofthe Heir Apparent’s divorcefrom Princess Di and hismarriage to Mrs. CamillaParker-Bowles. Did you notethe Mrs.? Oops! Isn’t it inter-esting that Charles’ predecessor,Edward VIII, had to abdicate thethrone when he chose to marrya divorcee? At least Camilla isBritish!

On this date in
1906, the famous
entertainer Josephine Baker wasborn. She had acting, dancing,and comic talent, but was alsowell known for her risqué cos-tumes: She once took the stagewearing little more than a skirtmade from 16 bananas. She wasmore than the Madonna of hertime, however; she was a fighteragainst tyranny and bigotry.Because of her mixed-race back-ground, she was too dark-skinnedto be accepted by American audi-ences until late in her life.Instead, she gained fame in Paris,France, which was much moreaccepting and liberal. She becameone of the most photographedwomen in the world; by 1927, shewas the best-paid woman inEurope. Baker worked for theFrench Underground duringWWII, earning the title Chevalierof the Legion of Honor from theFrench government. After thewar, she traveled to America, butrefused to perform for segregatedaudiences. She also adopted 12children of different races toprove that all humans could bebrothers and sisters regardless of
1693
the color of their skin, and
referred to her brood as “theRainbow Tribe.” Toward the endof her life, Baker performed inCarnegie Hall, earning a standingovation before her performance.She died in Paris at the age of68, and was the first Americanwoman to be buried in Francewith military honors. In herhonor, try the Banana Dream.

Of America’s many loves, the
two that have perhaps influencedus most during the twentiethcentury are the automobile andvideo entertainment. On this datein 1933, the two loves were com-bined as the first drive-in movietheater in America opened inCamden, New Jersey. The drive-in was the brainchild of RichardHollingshead. He experimentedin his own driveway by firstplacing a projector on the hoodof his car and showing the pic-ture on a sheet attached to trees.As we contemplated this neatfeat in entertainment, we alsowondered whether Hollingsheadever gave thought to the activitiesgoing on in the cars occupied byhorny teenaged couples?

“A drink a day

–EDWARD ABBEY
In the early days of television,
shows were less scripted, andstars had to be ready for any-thing. Actors and comedianswith a quick wit and no fear ofthe unexpected thrived. MiltonBerle fit this description perfectly.He hosted his own show, whichpremiered on this date in 1948. Itwas originally dubbed T exaco Star
Th eat e r, and it was a smash suc-
cess. Berle became a superstaralmost immediately, earning thehighest ratings on TV. Americanswere drawn to his zany antics;he frequently performed in out-rageous costumes—even in drag—and the audience loved the ad-libbed slapstick. Have a Captainwith a Skirt, described below,as you think of some of yourfavorite TV stars who favorthe feminine flavor of dress.Ally McBeal doesn’t count!

American thoroughbred racing is
steeped in tradition—the seer-sucker suits, the ladies in wide-brimmed hats, the grandmas bet-ting their entire social securitychecks on the 50 to 1 long shots.We, of course, focus on the tra-ditional drinks, especially theMint Julep, considered a staple atthe Kentucky Derby. TheKentucky Derby is one-third ofthe Triple Crown; the Preaknessand the Belmont Stakes make upthe other two-thirds. Rare is thehorse that wins all three legs ofthe Triple Crown, but on thisdate in 1973, one famous horsedid just that. Secretariat hadalready won the first two races,setting track records while doingso. Secretariat set a new worldrecord while winning theBelmont Stakes, winning by anastounding 31 lengths. By thetime Secretariat retired, he hadearned over $1.3 million, a recordat the time and a heck of a lotof Purina Horse Chow!

By the end of the
twentieth century,
colonialism was in full fervor,with powerful nations dividingup portions of countries andcontinents. This was the case inAsia as well. Western govern-ments were eager to sell theirgoods to the burgeoning Chinesemarket. (Hmm . . . sound famil-iar?) When government officialsrefused, the military was calledin to help, and by “help” wemean “impose the will of theforeigners.” Segments of theChinese populace, including asociety known as the Fists ofRighteous Harmony, or Boxers,grew frustrated with Westerninfluence and exploitation. TheBoxers began a series of attacks,often bloody and murderous. Onthis date in 1900, the fightingreached its zenith, and a full-outBoxer Rebellion began. The for-eign military were quick torespond, invading port cities andsurrounding areas and establish-ing control for many years. GreatBritain was the last to release itsclaims to portions of China

when it returned Hong Kong to
Chinese ownership. (See January20.) We wonder: could this continued foreign exploitationhave helped launch the ChineseRevolution? Think this one overas you sip the Chinese Cocktail,described here.

What’s a king to do? More exactly,
what’s a king to do when sur-rounded by unhappy, weapon-wielding barons who are sick ofpaying exorbitant taxes? This wasexactly the predicament of KingJohn of England, who ascendedto the throne with the passing ofhis brother, Richard the Lion-hearted. John probably couldhave been called the Greedy-at-all-costs-hearted, which is how hegot himself into his predicament.He had imposed taxes, stolenland, fought the Church—a seri-ous no-no back then—and, ingeneral, gotten the lesser noblespissed off. They captured himand forced him to sign the MagnaCarta, which means “great char-ter” in Latin, on this date in 1215,on a little island near Londoncalled Runnymede. The docu-ment restricted the powers of themonarch, reestablished the rightsof the Church, and gave thebarons a voice in government.Almost as an afterthought, it also established a set of rightsfor the common man, whichproved a resource in the writing of the Declaration of166-197_Odd_m3.qxd  3/6/06  11:48 AM  Page 183textJob no:70359 Title : FW-The Daily Cooktail Client : Pro-vision

our share of scandals—the O.J.trial, the Martha Stewart trial, theMichael Jackson trial. We could goon forever! The daddy of all presi-dential scandals, however, evenbigger than that of “My cigar hastwo uses” Bill Clinton, began tounravel on this date in 1971. Fivemen were arrested for breakinginto the headquarters of theDemocratic National Committee inthe Watergate Hotel inWashington, DC. Eventually, theirefforts to wiretap the office werelinked back to Richard Nixon,Republican president. The irony isthat he had won the recent elec-tion by a landslide and hadn’tneeded any information from theDems to help him. In trying topersuade the American public ofhis innocence, he stated thefamous phrase, “I am not acrook.” Sounds like “I did nothave sex with that woman” to us!Faced with impeachment, Nixoneventually resigned, his VicePresident Gerald Ford took over,and then Ford gave Tricky Dick apardon for his role in the scandal.This is juicier than a DesperateHousewives episode! And it really
happened! Consider that as youtry a Dirty Dick’s Downfall.

There are those times in your life
when everything is going well—you meet with success in all ofyour ventures. The folly in us allis that we never remember thatgood things come to an end. Andso it was for Napoleon Bonaparte,who rose from nothing to becomeNapoleon I, Emperor of theFrench. He was a decisive mili-tary commander, winning manybattles against seemingly impossi-ble odds. He was overzealous,however, and campaigns meant tobe routs of the enemy frequentlyfailed. Such was the case atWaterloo, where Napoleonattempted to defeat the BritishArmy, led by the Duke ofWellington. Plagued by badweather—this was beforeTimberland made those comfy,waterproof boots—and the poordecisions of his underlings,Napoleon was defeated on this

exile for the remainder of his life.So devastating was the defeat thattoday, a person who endures sucha resounding failure in his life issaid to “meet his Waterloo.” PoorNapoleon! One may question hismotives and methods, but he didlive according to his mantra,“Glory is fleeting, but obscurity isforever.” Obscure he was not! Trythe Napoleon as you figure outhow you will battle obscurity.

JUNEIt seems like June
is the month 
of the French—we’ve shared aboutthem handing Paris to theGermans and the defeat ofNapoleon at Waterloo. Now it istime to share some good news,for on this date in 1885, the Statueof Liberty arrived in the UnitedStates. It was designed by thefamed sculptor Frédéric-AugusteBartholdi, and was given from thepeople of France to the people ofthe United States as a symbol offriendship. The statue weighs 225tons, and its height from base tothe top of the torch is slightlyover 151 feet. She’s a big girl,isn’t she? Lady Liberty was thetallest structure in New YorkCity for over a decade. Alsoimpressive was the way inwhich the city celebrated theunveiling: 20,000 marched in aparade while over a millionwatched. Now we can thank theFrench for delicous cheese andwine, the Statue of Liberty, ANDthousands of extra dollars inclean-up costs! Have a LibertyCocktail and be thankful for yourown freedom . . . fries.

The Americans and theSoviets were in the throes of theCold War, having recently survivedthe Cuban Missile Crisis. The needfor the leaders of the two super-powers to be able to speak imme-diately in the event of impendingcatastrophe was obvious. Thus, thetwo sides came together in Genevato work out the “hotline,” a seriesof phone, teletype, and telegraphwires linked through other majorcities worldwide. Can you imaginepaying that phone bill?

women were enrolled into theUnited States Military Academyat West Point, New York, on thisday in 1976. The hardships theyendured were numerous andunimaginable, but none were sopoignant or heartrending as thedaily battle they faced to get themen to learn to put the toiletseat down. On May 28, 1980, 62of these female cadets graduatedand were commissioned as sec-ond lieutenants. Today, theAcademy has an enrollment of more than 4,000 students of both genders.

We can’t decide whether it’s
worse to have to sit at the diningroom table and tell your parentsthat you are a high-paid porn starwith 13-inch . . . er, talent, or tellthem that you’ve been convictedof receiving stolen property,which is what happened to pornstar John Holmes on this day in1982. Regardless, we’re pretty surethat either is better than having totell them that you’re addicted tocrack cocaine and being investi-gated for involvement in a high-profile murder case, which alsohappened to Holmes. By the timehe had to explain that he had losthis edge in the straight pornworld and was doing gay porn,we suspect his parents were usedto disappointing news from theirlittle boy. Oh well, it’s a slippery,slippery slope, we suppose. Havea Slippery Dick and hope younever have to find out!

his debut on
American Bandstand, the
television dance show that
dominated the airwaves for 50years (nationally for 30) and hadnearly every major rock artist onwith the exception of ElvisPresley and the Beatles. Sadly, itwasn’t long after MTV hit thecable wires that Americans weresimply done with dance shows,and American Bandstand slunk into
the shadows. Apparently, videowent on a killing spree, doingaway with not only the radio starbut also the dance show star. Butdon’t worry, Dick, New Year’sEve in Times Square is as time-less as you are.

to teach the world tosing in perfect harmony(ha, now you have it stuck inyour head!). But as many of usremember, it was mayhem, farfrom harmony, in the early ’80s,when the company shook up itsformula and introduced “NewCoke” to a fickle American mar-ket. Nobody liked it. Actually,we think that the popular kidsdidn’t like it and everybody elsejust hopped on board.Regardless, the trick worked.(What, you don’t think this wasall a big accident, do you?) Thisday in 1985 marked the end ofCoca-Cola’s “New Coke” experi-ment. The company startedrestocking the shelves with“Classic Coke” the next day, tothe joy of everybody exceptPepsiCo, which were allegedlyresponsible for Coke’s sly littlemarketing move in the firstplace.

toys of all time went on sale onthis day in 1960, when the firstEtch A Sketch hit shelves nation-wide. The red-framed square“palette” allowed children andadults to create two-dimensionalmasterpieces with only twoknobs in the bottom two corners.The toy makers didn’t realize,however, the volatility of theproduct they were putting intothe hands of the consumer, asfamilies have been ripped apartand friendships destroyed foreverwith one single act: the upside-down shake, shake, shake thatwiped the screen clean.

Herman Ruth made
his major-league debut for theBoston Red Sox. He was the vic-tor in a 4-3 nipping of the lowlyCleveland Naps. That was howthe Babe began as a pitcher, andhe just kept getting better. Hewas sold to the Yankees for$125,000 in 1920, setting intomotion what many Bostoniansknow as the Curse of theBambino, a curse that kept theSox from winning a World Serieschampionship for an astonishing86 years.

his impeccable phrasing and tim-ing, made his recording debutwith the Harry James Band onthis day in 1939. Because of abooming music and screen careerand his position in the high-pro-file group of musical bad boys,the Rat Pack, Sinatra had a larg-er-than-life presence in the publiceye and became an Americanicon, known for his brash, oftenpompous attitude, as embodiedby his signature song “My Way.”Below is a classic that hearkensback to Sinatra’s heyday.

214Hunter S. Thompson was born on
July 18, 1937. An American journal-ist and author, he was known for his flamboyant writing style,most famously demonstrated in hispopular Beat-era novel Fear and
Loathing in Las V egas , which blurred
the distinctions between writerand subject and fiction and nonfic-tion. The distinction that wasn’tblurred, however, was thatbetween sober and high as a freak-ing kite. It is quite clear straightthrough that he didn’t have a sobermoment when writing it.Thompson committed suicide inearly 2005, but ever the entertainer,he left instructions that his ashesbe shot out of a cannon of hisown design as Bob Dylan’s “Mr.Tambourine Man” played in thebackground.

222Another one of
those thrilling daysin history, July 25,1871, was the day SethWheeler of Albany, New York,patented perforated toilet paper.This falls into the category ofinventions we wish we knew theorigins of. I mean, we can onlyimagine what caused poor Seth,sitting on his throne, to think:“Hey, this would be a hell of alot easier if it separated smoothlyfrom the roll. I know, I think I’llinvent perforated toilet paper!”Thanks to Seth and his activeimagination, we all take care ofbusiness just a little bit easier, sotear off a square and raise yourglasses to Seth in Albany, whojust couldn’t take the unravelingfor one more day.

Philip “Mick” Jagger was born onthis day in 1943 in Kent, England.He is obviously most famous for being the lead singer andcofounder of the Rolling Stones.His second claim to fame is hav-ing the largest and most animatedlips in show business. His juicylove life had him paired with several famous women over theyears, but perhaps the most pub-licized was his nine-year marriageto Texas model Jerry Hall in the ’90s. But, apparently, Mick
couldn’t get no satisfaction,
because that marriage came to a screeching halt in 1999. Sorry,Mick, you really can’t always getwhat you want.

Bugs Bunny was the most endur-ing American cartoon characterof the twentieth century. TheWarner Brothers’ star was acocky, wisecracking, good-heartedhare who battled Elmer Fudd,Daffy Duck, and other slapsticknemeses in dozens of animatedshort films. Bugs’s screen debuttook place on this day in 1940,when he showed up in the ani-mated short A Wild Hare and
uttered his trademark line,“What’s up, Doc?” We love Bugs,but have often wondered abouthis mental state. I mean, we’reconcerned with the cross-dressing,sure, but how many wrong turnscan you take in Albuquerque?While you consider that, why notpay tribute to the voice of BugsBunny, Mel Blanc.

of the century, andthe entire worldeither went to bed lateor woke up early in order to sit,eyes glazed over, staring at thetelevision as Britain’s PrinceCharles married Lady DianaSpencer on this day in 1981 in St.Paul’s Cathedral in London.

230On this date in 1824,
Fifth Avenue openedin New York City. Atits start, the street washome only to residences—veryexpensive residences. It wasn’tuntil 1906 that a retail storeopened on this famed fashionboulevard. The neighbors wereunhappy, of course, despite thefact that the tony shop was builtto resemble a Florentine palace.Other shops opened, and they,too, looked more like expensivehomes rather than places to buynew duds. When Lord and Tayloropened, with its very commerciallook, the neighbors were so upsetthat they moved farther up theroad. More retailers moved in, andFifth Avenue became known as aplace to do your shopping—veryexpensive shopping. Celebrate thisstylish street with a drink—theFifth Avenue, described here.

So what, yousay, people can date siblings, right?Yes, they can and they do.However, these two brothers wereKennedys: JFK and RFK, the pres-ident and attorney general of theUnited States at the time.

She becamethe first female solo artist to sellfive million copies of a record, inthis case her album “Like aVirgin.” Our question is, whatdoes “like a virgin” mean? Howare you like a virgin, Madonna?Do you giggle when boys touchyou and say things like, “I’m notready yet?” Do you still get towear white to your wedding?How about off-white? We boughtthe album like everyone else inthe ’80s, so obviously we appreci-ate the mystique. We also appre-ciate that Madonna has sold morethan 130 million albums since,making her very wealthy. She’smarried now and has two chil-dren. This brings us to our lastquestion: if you have two kids,doesn’t this prove you’re not avirgin?

242In high school, we
all knew who the
popular kids were. Maybe wewanted to eat at the cafeteriatable with them, or we longed tohave their talent on the footballfield or basketball court. Maybewe wanted to be Prom King orQueen, too, or at least part ofthe Prom “court” like the othersycophants. If the popular kidswere nice, it made the situationeven more difficult: “They’rebeing nice to me; maybe they’llinvite me to their parties.” Deepdown inside, we knew it wouldbe better if we could hate thecool kids, openly showing ourdisdain for them as we went offto band practice or the AV Clubmeeting. When the popular kidsthrew their popularity in ourfaces, it was fair game to hatetheir guts. So how about this: asthe Beatles invaded the UnitedStates, kick-starting the rock ’n’roll movement, fans throngedtheir buses and performances.Girls swooned at the very sightof the four band members.

Viva la revolucion! On this date in
1926, Fidel Castro, the man whobrought Communism to Cuba,was born. After several interestingattempts, he overthrew the gov-ernment of Fulgencio Batista andlaid claim to power in 1959. Hehas served as the country’s leaderever since. Early on, he upsetAmerican businesses by national-izing industries. PresidentEisenhower enacted an economicembargo, and American touristshave been forbidden from travel-ing to Cuba without special per-mission since that time. We won-der what Cuba would be liketoday if Castro had not been soabsolute in his absolute dictator-ship. Would the island country ofbeautiful old buildings and a longhistory still be a tourist destina-tion? Can’t you picture Americanstaking quick jaunts to Havana todrink mojitos while walking inHemingway’s steps? We do haveto grant it to Castro: Cuba has thehighest literacy rate in the WesternHemisphere and claims to havezero homelessness, and everyonehas access to health care. Thatleads us to one more question: if
everything is so great, why are somany people trying to float onrafts made of tires to leave thecountry? Hmmm . . . have a mojito as you wonder aboutCastro’s Communist Cuba.

creating toys that can kill. Some of these toys can kill others, whilesome can kill the user of the toy.Today’s celebration is an exampleof the latter. On this date in 1885,the world’s first motorcycle, madeby Gottlieb Daimler, was patented.So, you want me to get onto atwo-wheeled vehicle without anyprotection and zoom around atbreakneck speeds? Wow! Thatsounds great! We find it interest-ing that many bikers prefer not towear helmets; almost half thestates in the United States don’tmandate their use, and some statesdon’t require helmets under any
circumstances. Considering thata motorcycle rider is 16 timesmore likely to die in a crashthan a car driver is, we wonderabout the lack of helmet use.It’s not that we don’t under-stand the glory of motorcycles.We appreciate the exhilaration,the rush of blood, the sense ofcontrol. We just prefer to getthese feelings from a good, stiffdrink! Try the Bloody Biker,described here, but not if youare going out on your ownmotorcycle trip.

Shakespeare reveled in writing
tragedies. And no tragedy was
more ripe for revelation than thedouble suicide of Antony andCleopatra. Here's some of thesoap-opera-esque story: Cleo hadassumed the throne of Egyptafter her father and two oldersisters died. Mark Antony, one ofthe rulers of Rome, fell in lovewith her; they had three chil-dren. One of the other rulerswas outraged that Anthony hadset up shop in a foreign landand was flagrantly committingadultery. He convinced the sen-ate to wage war against Egypt.Antony fled, but, disgusted byhis failure, committed suicide byfalling on his own sword. Howdid Cleopatra end it? Sheangered a poisonous snake—anasp—to the point that it bit her.This took place on this date in30 B.C.E. Ah, true love; when it'swrapped in tragedy, how canthere not be a great story? Trythe Snakebite and think aboutyour own great story.

Pour the whiskey over ice;

a fairy-tale existenceis impossible. This wasdefinitely the case for DianaSpencer, better known as PrincessDiana. Both Diana and her hus-band Prince Charles pursued rela-tionships, and Diana was linkedwith several celebrities. She waseventually drawn to Dodi Fayed,whose father owned the Ritz Hotelin Paris and famed departmentstore Harrods in London. Thepaparazzi followed them relentless-ly, and, on this date in 1997, Diana,Dodi, and their driver were killedin an automobile accident in Pariswhile being pursued on motorcy-cles. This drink commemorates thesong Elton John rewrote for Dianaafter her death.

the Beat Generationwas published on thisday in 1957. On the Road
by Jack Kerouac is a largely auto-biographical work, written in astream-of-consciousness style andbased on the spontaneous roadtrips Kerouac and his BeatGeneration friends, William S.Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg,took across mid-century America.Upon publication, the bookbecame an overnight success. Asthe story goes, it was written byKerouac in only three weeks in aburst of artistic fury, hammeredout on one long scroll of teletypepaper. Our editors wish we hadbeen so speedy while writing thisbook, but hey, we were drinking!Oh wait, so was Kerouac—he diedat age 47 after a life of heavydrinking.

He had spent thenight with a girlfriend and diedin bed after taking a reportednine sleeping pills and chokingon his own vomit. Sleeping pillsweren’t Hendrix’s only drug ofchoice, however; he was widelyknown to be a big fan of allsorts of mind-altering substances,such as PCP and LSD . . . andnow, thanks to his love of drugs,he’s D.E.A.D.

The starlet wasdiagnosed with manic-depressivepsychosis. Her story is fascinatingand horrific, with treatment ranging from shock therapy tohydrotherapy (icy baths—for eighthours at a time) to a lobotomy . . .with an ice pick!

290It is rare that a well-known movie
director “lowers” his standards todo television. But AlfredHitchcock enjoyed a challenge,and he enjoyed being the focus ofthings. He agreed to produce aweekly TV series called Alfred
Hitchcock Presents, which aired for
the first time on this date in 1955.At first, each episode was 30 min-utes, and then, due to the popular-ity of the series, the shows becamean hour each. Apparently, theAmerican public couldn’t getenough terror and mystery in theirlives! The series remained on tele-vision for 10 years, but also contin-ues in reruns to this day.

the name Anita
Hill became synony-
mous with workplace hanky-panky. Hill had served as anassistant to Clarence Thomas,first at the Department ofEducation and then at the EqualEmployment OpportunityCommission. According to Hill,Thomas tried many opportuni-ties to “employ” her outside of anormal working relationship.This happens in workplaces allthe time, of course, but the dif-ference here is that Thomas wasnominated by the first PresidentBush to serve on the SupremeCourt. On this date in 1991, thepreviously undisclosed details ofHill’s harassment allegations werereported by the press, jolting thecountry and jeopardizingThomas’s nomination. Hill testi-fied before the Senate JudiciaryCommittee five days later.Thomas testified, too, defendinghimself and denying the charges.Reaction to Hill ran the gamutfrom supportive (“That poorwoman!”) to extremely negative(“She’s trying to ruin that man!”).As we know, Thomas was con-firmed; the vote was 52 to 48.
Hill’s testimony was not fornaught, however. Sexual harass-ment in the workplace becamesomething people could talkabout, and the number of report-ed cases—and monetary awardsto victims—skyrocketed.

On this date in
1920, the Holland
Tunnel began construction. Thetunnel links Jersey City to NewYork City under the HudsonRiver. It took seven years tobuild, and the cost, in today’sdollars, was $1.4 billion. The tun-nel was named for CliffordMilburn Holland, chief engineerfor the project, who passed awayfrom exhaustion on the nightbefore the work crews fromeither side were supposed tobreak through the last few feetof earth. A later engineer, OleSingstad, is credited with devis-ing the ventilation system for thetunnel, a feat never accomplisheduntil then. Eighty-four fanspump fresh air into the tunnelevery 90 seconds, making air inthe tunnel actually cleaner thanthe air above the surface of theHudson River. Of course, it’sprobably not too difficult to findair that’s cleaner than New YorkCity air in just about any place.Have an Urban Jungle as youplan your next trip to the BigApple.

Margaretha Zelle
was born in Hollandin 1876. She was dark-skinned, almost exotic, in a coun-try of people with blond hairand blue eyes. She and her fami-ly lived in Java and then Sumatra.Upon her return to Europe at thestart of World War I, she began anew life as an exotic dancer inParis under the name Mata Hari,which means “eye of the day” inMalay. Men flocked to her, andshe was equal opportunity in hertrysts—German, French, andRussian men of different ages andstatus were wooed—so someviewed her suspiciously. Was shea German spy? Was she a Frenchspy? Some say she was both,some say she was neither. TheFrench intercepted a Germancommuniqué implicating MataHari. She was arrested, tried, andthen executed on this date in 1917.Have a Spy Catcher as you thinkof secrets you’d rather not havepeople know about.

The Bell XS-1, nicknamedthe Glamour Glennis after Yeager’swife, broke the sound barrier, fly-ing Mach 1.06 (that’s 700 miles perhour for us laypeople), on thisday in 1947. Yeager took the planeto 43,000 feet over Victorville,California. The achievement waskept secret until June of 1948.This leads us to two questions:didn’t the residents of Victorvillehear the sonic boom above theirheads as Yeager reached such ahigh speed? And when Yeager wasflying faster than the speed ofsound, could he still listen to theradio in the cockpit? Think aboutit as you try the High Speed,described here.

Fame and fortune can be fleet-
ing, as was found by one OscarFingal O’Flahertie Wills Wilde,born in Dublin on this date in1854. His father had been a suc-cessful doctor, and his motherwas a writer who spoke severallanguages. Wilde must haveinherited her gifts, because hewas recognized at an early age asbeing an exceptional writer. Hewrote and produced several popular plays in his lifetime,among them A W oman of No
Importance, An Ideal Husband, andThe Importance of Being Earnest. He
also wrote poetry, yet it was hisone novel, The Picture of Dorian
Gray, that gained him notoriety
due to its homosexual under-tones—a no-no in VictorianEngland. Although this may haveseemed scandalous at the time,the novel wasn’t his undoing.Despite his seven years of mar-riage and the fact that he hadfathered two children, it wasWilde’s affair with the college-aged son of the Marquis ofQueensberry that got him intotrouble. Wilde sued the Marquisfor libel when the Marquis calledhim a homosexual. Wilde eventu-
ally withdrew the charges—forobvious reasons—but was subse-quently arrested for gross indecen-cy. He was found guilty and sen-tenced to two years of hard labor.His wife left him, and Wilderelied on the kindness of friendsas he drifted during the remainingfew years of his life. We do havea few questions about the wholeaffair: if you are going to hold thetitle of Marquis of Queensberry,what lifestyle do you think yourson is going to lead?

Yousee, on this date in 1973, OPECbegan an embargo of oil toWestern countries and Japan.Why would these mostly Arabcountries do such a thing?Because the United States and itsallies had helped Israel rebuff anattack by Egypt and Syria inOctober of 1973. Although it suf-fered losses initially, Israel soonwas on the offensive and van-quished the intruders. Membersof OPEC were disgruntled andbegan the embargo. Oil priceseventually quadrupled, causingan energy crisis in the UnitedStates. For the first time,Americans were forced to realizethe implications of their depend-ence on foreign sources of ener-gy. Thankfully, we learned ourlesson and began to develop nat-ural and renewable resources to
replace oil and gas. Just kidding!We love oil and gas from foreigncountries! But we know thatthese other countries would nevertake advantage of our dependenceon them.

However, when a changein Australian government tookplace, Utzon was replaced byofficials who redesigned someaspects of the project, impactingacoustics.

311“Our missiles are
bigger than your missiles.” Suchis the essence of the CubanMissile Crisis, which began onthis date in 1962. Spy planes overCuba, which had become thecozy Communist comrade of theSoviet Union after the rise topower of Fidel Castro (seeAugust 13), communicated theconstruction of what appeared tobe missile silos. President John F.Kennedy was faced with thechoice of allowing a potentialnuclear threat to be located 20 orso miles off the U.S. coastline ordemanding that the missile basebe closed. The real difficulty wasthe involvement of the Soviets.The United States and the USSRwere in the throes of the ColdWar, and any misstep couldresult in nuclear warfare.Kennedy decided that an air andnaval blockade of the islandwould be the best route in han-dling the threat; he communicat-ed this to the American peopleand the Soviet government ontelevision. The Soviets backeddown—they promised to disman-
tle the missile base if the UnitedStates promised not to invadeCuba. The Soviets also demandedthat the missile site that had beenestablished in Turkey aimed atthe eastern half of their countrybe dismantled. The United Statessecretly agreed to this demand,because the Turkish site had beensecret as well. The world hadcome to the brink of war—per-haps nuclear, perhaps world-wide—and had survived. Try aCuba Libre, below. We assumethe libre, which means “free” inSpanish, stands for “free of mis-siles.”

By October 25, 1944, at the cul-
mination of the battle of LeyteGulf in the Philippines, theAllied Forces had experienced afrightening new tactic employedby the Japanese forces.  Thekamikaze pilots, who flew sui-cide missions with airplanesloaded with explosives into thedecks of Allied ships, were defi-nitely unexpected. The Japanesemilitary never had a problem in recruiting volunteers forkamikaze missions; in fact, therewere three times as many volun-teers as there were aircraft. Evenmore surprisingly, the averagekamikaze pilot was a 20-some-thing studying at a university.Their motives in volunteeringvaried from patriotism to a desireto bring honor to their families,or simply to prove themselvespersonally. Maybe they shouldhave considered taking up thecello. Just a thought . . .

The gunfight at the O.K. Corral
was an event of legendary pro-portions that took place onOctober 26, 1881, in a vacant lot,behind the corral in Tombstone,Arizona. For such a historicallylauded event, it was surprisinglyshort: only 30 shots were fired injust 30 seconds. Wyatt Earp,Morgan Earp, Virgil Earp, andDoc Holliday fought against BillyClaiborne, Frank McLaury, TomMcLaury, Billy Clanton, and IkeClanton. To this day, pro-Earpfollowers view the gunfight as astruggle between law-and-orderand outlaw forces, while pro-Clanton/McLaury followers viewit as a political vendetta andabuse of authority. We view it asthe stuff of good movie makin’!

College was founded. You knowHarvard—it’s the place your par-ents tell their acquaintances youwent to school. The place you’dlike to tell most people you wentto school.

Since 1974, 19Nobel Prize winners and 15Pulitzer Prize winners haveserved on the Harvard faculty.Rumor has it that, like osmosis,the more time you spend nearHarvard, the smarter youbecome.

On October 30, 1938, Orson
Welles aired his W ar of the W orlds
program over the radio wavesacross the United States. Thebroadcast was a contemporaryretelling of the events of Welles’novel of the same name, present-ed as a series of news bulletinsin documentary style. Funny forus—but not for them—manypeople missed or ignored theopening credits of the program,as well as the several disclaimersscattered throughout, and took itto be an actual news broadcastof extraterrestrials attacking theEarth. Needless to say, W ar of the
W orlds caused nationwide panic.
This was very similar to thenationwide panic we ourselvesexperienced when it wasannounced that it would bemade into a modern-day moviestarring Tom Cruise, whobelieves, incidentally, that we’reall aliens from another planet.

opening. The wine, the cheese,the critical judgments, the back-stabbing . . . a good time foreverybody! On this day in 1512,Michelangelo had an art openingof his own when his paintingson the ceiling of the SistineChapel were first exhibited tothe public. We’re sure there wasthe usual fanfare, raised eye-brows, whispers, you know thedrill.

On November 5, 1872, Susan B.
Anthony cast a vote in the U.S.presidential election, whichearned her a fine of $100—awhopping sum at the time. Whywould somebody be fined forvoting in an election, you mightask? Well, we’ll tell you. Ms.Anthony was a woman, and inthose days, women weren’tallowed to vote. Apparently, itwould seem the menfolk thoughtthe ladies would be better servedhavin’ babies and makin’ pie.Susan, a staunch suffragist, didn’tagree. She never paid the fine,and little more than 100 yearslater, her likeness graces theSusan B. Anthony dollar, a coinstill in circulation to this day.

It wasapparently all a propagandist coupon the part of the French govern-ment, which was trying to con-vince its citizens, still cranky fromthe loss of a beloved statue toItaly following the downfall ofNapoleon, that the Venus de Milowas a much greater treasure.

November 12 marked the breaking
point in a dark period of historyfor the American gay man. It wason this day in 1996 that JonathanSchmitz was convicted of second-degree murder for shooting ScottAmedure, a gay man who’drevealed that he had a crush onSchmitz during a taping of Th e
Jenny Jones Show in 1995. Schmitz
was lured onto the show withpromises that a secret crushwould be revealed, only to dis-cover that the amorous one washis gay neighbor, Amedure. We’reoutraged that anybody would killanother human being, especiallyfor something as innocuous as acrush, but we do questionAmedure’s thought process. Didhe really believe he was going towin his man by spilling his heartout on The Jenny Jones Show ? They
don’t have onstage bodyguards for nothing!

Walt Disney Pictures
released their third animatedfilm, Fantasia. A technical dream
at the time, the film met with alackluster reception and playedmostly at B-movie houses.Frankly, we’re shocked by this.How could a movie that includ-ed a mouse dressed up as amagician cajoling a herd ofbrooms to perform a choreo-graphed dance not be a smashhit? Oh, right. Well, luckily,Disney’s next film, Dumbo , was a
big hit. Drink a Magic Flute,below, while you ponder thenature of popularity.

337Theater junkies and
anybody who’s ever
watched nonfootball-related tele-vision on Thanksgiving after-noons can rejoice in celebrationon this day. It was on November16, 1959, that the Rodgers andHammerstein musical The Sound
of Music opened on Broadway.
Not too long after, it was madeinto a movie starring the lovelyJulie Andrews as an Austriansinging-nun-turned-nanny-turned-stepmother. We can thankRodgers and Hamm for suchcatchy jingles as “Doe a Deer”and “Climb Every Mountain.”We’d be remiss not to admit thatmore than one drunken nighthas found us whaling those twonumbers as well as the rest ofThe Sound of Music score (in falset-
to, of course) as we sipped aHot Nun down at the localpiano bar.

338As we look back upon
California’s colorful political
history, we can’t help but askourselves and everybody aroundus: what happened to California?It was on this day in 2003 thatAustrian bodybuilder ArnoldSchwarzenegger, who had alreadymelted into many of our pots,was sworn in as the thirty-eighthgovernor of the state. But thisisn’t the first time that theCalifornia Governor’s Mansionhas played host to an off-the-beaten-path tenant. Remember,before he made it to the WhiteHouse, Ronald Reagan spenttime in Sacramento as well. Iguess California just goes toprove that, in the United States,anyone really can be a politician.Hey, I think we’ve learned thislesson before . . .

1978, two metalbuckets of grape-fla-vored Kool-Aid laced withValium and cyanide were broughtinto the assembly hall of thePeople’s Temple Cult, which was headed by Jim Jones inJonestown, Guyana. The mixturewas dispensed to the entire con-gregation in small paper cups,and they were urged to kill them-selves by drinking the grapepunch. Surprisingly, they all did,more than 1,000 of them, as amatter of fact. And the reallyshocking thing is that theyweren’t even drunk! We under-stand how you might be skepticalof the grape stuff after readingthat, but try ours anyway—it hasmore of the good stuff and less of the bad. We promise.

We’ve all heard the question:
where were you when PresidentKennedy was shot? Those whowere around all have an answer,and it’s usually preceded by thestatement “I’ll never forget it.”But the only one it really mat-tered to was Kennedy himself,unfortunately. He was in Dallason this day in 1963, when he was assassinated while riding in a motorcade beside his wifeJackie. The nation mourned the beloved president, and the shooting still mystifies the nation.Have a Presidential Margarita to commemorate JFK.

346Speaking of underage
drinking in college (whichwe absolutely do not promote orcondone), it was on this day in1825 that the first college socialfraternity, Kappa Alpha, wasformed at Union College inSchenectady, New York. We’reguessing that since there were nocars to turn over then or televi-sions to toss out of bedroomwindows, things were muchtamer for the Kappa Alpha brothers. Luckily, there was alcohol, though, so tip your glassto the original party boys atUnion College. If not for them,generations of college studentsthat followed might have actuallygotten some school work done.

One of the Ten
Commandments canbest be summed up as “Thoushalt not covet thy neighbor’sgoods.” In this day and age wemight say, “Touch my stuff andI’ll smack you upside the head.”On this date in 1823, however, itwas stated entirely differently: No European powers would beinvolved in the goings-on of theAmericas, and likewise, theUnited States wouldn’t beinvolved in European affairs.Although this creed was calledthe Monroe Doctrine, it wasactually put forth by JohnQuincy Adams, the nation’s sixthpresident. The principle guidedAmerican foreign policy fordecades, isolating America frompotentially entangling allianceswith European countries at war.

The good news is that on this
day in 1921, the Anglo-Irish treatywas ratified, thereby freeingIreland of British rule. The badnews is that it caused a massivecivil war that pitted brotheragainst brother, cousin againstcousin, and worst of all, drinkingbuddy against drinking buddy.While we recognize that war isnever a dream, we realize thatfreedom is, so tip your glass tothe Irish today and thank yourlucky stars for freedom.

356It was on this day
in 1980 that JohnLennon was shotand killed outside ofhis New York City apartmentby deranged fan Mark DavidChapman. When asked if heknew what he had done,Chapman said, “I just shot JohnLennon.” He then took out acopy of J.D. Salinger’s Catcher in
the Rye and began reading.
Chapman was, at various pointsin his life, a drug addict, a born-again Christian, and a hospital-ized mental patient. He wasexpected to enter an insanityplea, but instead he pleadedguilty. Chapman has been deniedparole several times in recentyears and has received deaththreats should he ever bereleased. No surprise there—thoseBeatles fans don’t mess around!

December 7, 1941, was called by
American President Franklin D.Roosevelt “a day that will live ininfamy,” as it was on this daythat Pearl Harbor was bombedby Japanese forces, embroilingthe United States in the SecondWorld War. The attack damagedor destroyed 12 U.S. warshipsand 188 aircraft, and killed 2,403American servicemen and 68civilians. The United Statesdeclared war on Japan the verynext day, which confuses us,frankly. Wasn’t it pretty much agiven that the United States andJapan were at war when theJapanese jumped Hawaii?

Lech Walesa became Poland’s
first directly elected leader onthis day in 1990. During his pres-idency, he started the “war at thetop,” which meant shaking upthe government almost annually.He was responsible for com-pletely changing Poland from an oppressive Communist coun-try under strict Soviet controlwith a weak economy to anindependent and democraticcountry with a fast-growing free-market economy. Previous to thatsmall accomplishment, he wonthe 1983 Nobel Peace Prize andwas chosen as Timemagazine’s
“Man of the Year” in 1982. Bycomparison, in 1982 and 1983, we were struggling with acneand wrestling with the teenage-boy angst of boxers versus briefs.We’re sure Timewill be calling

10, 1965, that theGrateful Dead playedtheir first concert at FillmoreAuditorium in San Francisco.The band quickly became one ofthe most loved bands of all time,touring almost continuously for30 years. Many of their fans, whohappily accepted the moniker“Deadheads,” would follow theband on tour, much like JimmyBuffet’s “Parrotheads,” who fol-low him around from concert toconcert.

staunch animal-rights activist, wasborn on this day in 1923. Barker hasbecome the most visible figure inthe animal-rights movement. The“Fur Flap” surrounding the 1987Miss USA Pageant attracted tons of publicity when Barker took hischances, spun the wheel, andrefused to participate in the pro-gram if the models wore real furs asplanned. The game show host won,and fake furs were used. In honorof Barker’s love of animals, we offerThe Purple Squirrel for today’srefreshment. Neutered, of course.

We just can’t get enough royal
scandal! One of the first modern-day scandals for Britain’s royalshappened on this day in 1936,when King Edward VIII abdi-cated the throne and marriedAmerican divorcée WallisWarfield Simpson. It seemsBuckingham Palace and thecrown couldn’t compete withtrue love for the king, and in a chivalrous move that franklymakes us sigh and melts ourhearts, he stepped down andsailed off into the proverbial sunset with Ms. Simpson.

when you were a little kid?Miniature teacups, teapots, littlecakes? Well, when Bostonthrew its very own Tea Partyon this day in 1773, it was alot like that. Okay, not really;as a matter of fact, it wasnothing like that. You see, it wasall about taxation and the Britishimporters undercutting the pricesof local merchants. Fed up, theBostonians boarded ships loadedwith incoming tea and destroyed342 crates of it by dumping itinto Boston Harbor. This was alldone without the loss of a singlelife, so it was all very civilized,just like a tea party!

366December 17, 1903, is the
day in history thatchanged the way theworld travels. It was on thisday that Orville and WilburWright became the first peopleto successfully fly a motorizedairplane. As we’re sure yourecall, their triumph took placeat Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.They made four flights that day,which were witnessed by fourlifeguards from the beach and ayoung boy from the village. Weimagine that when the boyreported what he’d seen later inthe evening to his parents, hewas told something along thelines of “if God had intended forman to fly, he would have givenus wings.” Oh, if they onlyknew then what we know now.So shake up an American Flyer,described here, and take a flightof your own.

Shake the rum, lime juice, and 
syrup with cracked ice. Strain into a chilled white wine glass and fill with Champagne. On this day in

Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution wasproclaimed, abolishing slavery andputting an end to a very bleaktime in American history. As it
turned out, President Lincoln’s
Emancipation Proclamation of
1863 had only freed slaves
held in the Southern states,
while it was the Thirteenth
Amendment that hammered thenail in the coffin for Northernslave owners two years later. Butwait, wasn’t it the soldiers in theNorth who were fighting againstslavery in the Civil War? And ifslavery was simply a red herring,what was the whole Civil Warabout anyway? What every war
is about: the Benjamins, the
Jacksons, the Lincolns, and the

Louisiana Purchase was complet-ed and the territory was formallytransferred from France to theUnited States during ceremoniesin New Orleans. No small realestate deal, the LouisianaPurchase included nearly 530 mil-lion acres, or to put it in per-spective, roughly one-third of themainland United States. That issome serious square footage, andit came at a bargain, only $3 persquare mile! Boy, don’t we allwish we saw real estate priceslike that these days? Of course, italso came with a downside, asHurricane Katrina proved onceand for all.

lously wealthy high-societymaven Sunny von Bulow wasfound comatose on the floor ofher Newport, Rhode Island,bathroom. When investigatorsbegan sniffing around that bath-room, they smelled a lot morethan hair products and expensiveperfume—they smelled foul play.It seems Sunny had been injectedwith a lethal dose of insulin,leading to the eventual convic-tion of her husband, Claus, forattempted murder. But he waslater acquitted at a second trialand hightailed it back to Europe.Poor Sunny has remained in avegetative state in a New YorkCity hospital ever since, and hercase remains open.

enced the struggle:what is the perfect giftfor my one true love? Does shewant chocolates or flowers? Is itthe tie or the cuff links that willwarm his heart? When trying toimpress Rachel, a Dutch brothelemployee (yes, we all know whatthat made her: popular), on thisday in 1888, the artist Vincent vanGogh was clearly struggling withthe same indecision and chosemistakenly, as men often do. Hemust have thought that it’s notthe flowers or the diamonds thatwould make a real difference;instead, he should give her some-thing special, something of hisvery own. So he went down tothe brothel and delivered his rightear to her. Police went to hishome the next day and deliveredhim to the hospital. What sort ofcard says “Thanks for the bodypart.

375Christmas Day. The
gifts are unwrapped,
the tinsel is falling off the tree,the fire is making the wholehouse hot, and Grandpa is snor-ing in the Barcalounger. Nothingleft to do but pick up where youleft off last night with the eggnogwhile you pick at the turkeybones still sitting on the counter.But instead of eggnog, wethought you might appreciategoing a little more hard-coretoday; after all, the sooner youpass out, the sooner it’s allbehind you and you can hit thestores and start the returns.

◗Kwanzaa is a
weeklong holidayobservance held fromDecember 26 to January 1to honor African-American heritage, primarily in the UnitedStates. It was founded in 1966 byRon Karenga. It is not a religiousholiday but a cultural one, a syn-cretic festival, based on variouselements of the first harvest cele-brations widely celebrated inAfrica. The timing is meant tooffer people an alternative to thegrowing commercialism ofChristmas, but a recent surveyshows that only 1.6 percent ofthe African-American communitycelebrates Kwanzaa. It doesn’tmatter what color you are:nobody wants to give up Santa!

376We want to dislike her, we really
do, she stood against everythingwe lean drunkenly on the barfor, but we can’t help but admirethe chutzpah of Carry A. Nation,who attacked a saloon in Kansason this day in 1900 in her fightagainst alcohol. She eventuallydid this more than 30 times. Alarge woman, at 6 feet tall and175 pounds, she liked to describeherself as “a bulldog runningalong at the feet of Jesus, barkingat what he doesn’t like.” Aloneor accompanied by hymn-singingwomen, she would march,singing and praying, into a barwhile smashing bar fixtures andbottles of alcohol with a hatchet.That’s one feisty, booze-hatin’granny! She was slightly beforeher time, however, as Prohibitionin the United States didn’t kickin until 1919, but eventuallyNation’s mission was accom-plished . . . thankfully, for only ashort while.

378The struggle between
church and state has
been a long one, involving pow-erful popes and murderous mon-archs. One of the best-knowntales of such disagreement result-ed in the assassination ofArchbishop Thomas Becket onthis date in 1170. Becket had pre-viously been a staunch supporterof the English monarchy andKing Henry II; at one time,Henry had even sent his son tolive with Becket. Upon his instal-lation as the Archbishop ofCanterbury in 1162, Becket did a180-degree turn. He wanted thechurch to have complete autono-my over its own proceedingsand, further, to make the churchimmune from taxation by themonarchy. Henry was so vexedby this about-face and the subse-quent demands that he purport-edly stated, “Will no one rid meof this troublesome priest?”Several of his knights overheardtheir leader, and so rid him theydid; Becket was murdered inCanterbury Cathedral. Henrywas reviled throughout29
Christendom, faced rebellion led
by his wife and three of hissons, and eventually paidpenance at Becket’s tomb. Whata real-life game of chess thisseems! Try an Archbishop, thedrink listed here, or we’ll havesome of our knight friends stopby your place, too!

oeNhacNtsaLARRY DONOVAN
Larry Donovan drank as an amateur early in his 20s and then
professionally from the moment he could get through theentire night and still remember it the next day. Though a res-ident of the Boston area and a lifelong New Englander, hehas taken his drinking to over 20 states, Washington, D.C.,and countries in North America, Europe and Africa. Like aparent with his children, he cannot choose his favorite drink- but it knows! As stated in The Daily Cocktail, he hopes tobe able to manage his alcoholic intake carefully so that hemay continue to drink for the rest of his life. Cheers!ACKNOWLEDGMENTSABOUT THE 
AUTHORSThanks to the Fair Winds Press staff
beginning with publisher Holly Schmidtwho knowingly announced during astaff meeting that we would be the perfect authors for this book because,although we weren’t professional bar-tenders, we were professional drinkers.We thank our editor Ellen Phillips whowhole-heartedly agreed and managed tokeep us sober enough to finish the bookyet urged us to stay drunk enough toenjoy it.  Thanks to managing editorJohn Gettings who put up with theabuse without having a single drink…atleast during working hours. And specialthanks to Fair Winds’ president KenFund who has rolled his eyes andgroaned but still greenlighted the project.We’d like to thank every bartender
who’s ever said to us: “Here try this,you’ll love it!” and we’d like to especiallythank every bartender who’s ever saidthe words:  “This one’s on me.”  
We’d like to thank all of our long-
standing, tried-and-true drinking friendswho enthusiastically helped us test thedrinks and not so enthusiastically heldour hair back when we’d tested toomuch. They are: Jason Southerland,Annie Damphousse, Catherine Caswell,Steve Katnack, Karen Rosenhoover,Kimberly Samaha, and Kelly and MikaelBackman. We hope you have such greatfriends to drink with as well.

DALYN A. MILLER
Dalyn A. Miller began his drinking in the Southwestern state
of New Mexico where he was broken-in early on wine cool-ers, tequila and cheap Mexican beer. Once he’d moved to theNortheast and regained his taste buds he refined his drinkinghabits and expanded his repertoire to include cocktails fromall over the world (except Norwegian Aquavit which he stillcan’t stomach following an unsavory crab fishing trip in theNorth Sea in the late 80s). Like James Bond he likes his mar-tinis shaken and not stirred, but is the first to admit that thesimilarities come to a screeching halt there.  His liver is aliveand well and resides in Boston.
