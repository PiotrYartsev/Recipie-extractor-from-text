CHAPTER 1
THE INDIAN 
KITCHEN
Indian food is a rich blend of spices and herbs 
crafted into sauces and seasonings for grains 
and vegetables. It is possible for anyone to 
re-create the food of India with a little knowl-
edge and the willingness to try different flavor 
combinations. In recent years, the Instant Pot 
has become very popular in many Indian homes. 
This all-in-one appliance saves lots of cooking time 
and energy and keeps the authentic flavors intact. 
This section will help familiarize you with Instant 
Pot cooking techniques and key spices and ingredi-
ents that are used throughout this book.
1 | VEGETARIAN INDIAN INSTANT POT COOKBOOK2THE INSTANT POT AND 
INDIAN COOKING
Traditional Indian cooking is a time-intensive process because most Indian 
dishes involve boiling and steaming food. Because cooking fuel is expensive 
in India, pressure cooking has become the most efficient and economical 
way of making meals. In addition, it saves time by infusing flavors into any 
dish in a short amount of time.
In recent years, many home cooks have pivoted from the less reliable 
stovetop pressure cookers to the Instant Pot, both in the United States and 
in India. Many traditional Indian recipes work perfectly in an Instant Pot. 
The moist, pressurized environment is well suited for imparting the best 
flavor and nutrient retention for classic Indian dishes including:
Biryani: This rice casserole usually requires multiple pots and pans and a lot 
of time, but with the Instant Pot, the prep and cooking are streamlined, and 
the result tastes just as delicious.
Dal: Lentils and beans take a long time to cook on the stovetop and need 
periodic attention, but the Instant Pot’s preset bean/chili option makes 
cooking them a breeze.
Curry: Many Indian curries have sautéed vegetable and protein components 
and sauces that require long simmering times. In an Instant Pot, you can do 
all the prep and cooking in one vessel and then pressure-cook the sauce for 
perfect curry in no time.
THE INDIAN PANTRY
Stocking your pantry can feel overwhelming if you are new to Indian cook -
ing, but most of the ingredients needed to make delicious dishes are readily 
available in your local supermarket. A few might require you to look online 
or make a trip to an Indian grocery store. For any of these specialty ingredi-
ents, I’ll explain why they’re necessary and offer easy-to-find alternatives 
when possible.ThE INDIAN K ITChEN  |  3Spices
Spices are the backbone of Indian cooking. I highly recommend buying 
whole spices and storing them in airtight jars in a cool, dark place in the 
pantry. When stored properly, whole spices will last for at least a year, but 
ground spices lose their potency after a couple of months, so grind only a 
small batch to enjoy the freshest flavor in your dishes.
Asafetida (hing): The dried resin from a fennel-like plant, this spice is always 
added to hot oil, which tames its pungency and imparts an umami flavor to 
the dish. Look for it in Indian groceries or online.
Bay leaves: Dried bay leaves are used whole to flavor rice and curries. 
They’re fibrous and tough, so always remember to remove them 
before serving.
Black peppercorns (kali mirch): Both whole and ground peppercorns are used 
for their flavor and aroma in many dishes.
Cardamom pods (elaichi): These green pods have tiny black seeds inside. The 
whole pods are used to infuse hot oil with a sweet, delicate flavor.
Cinnamon (dalchini): This highly aromatic, sweet spice is commonly used to 
flavor the oil in which vegetables and lentils simmer. When toasted and 
ground, it produces a gentle warmth in spice blends like Garam Masala 
(page 129).
Cloves (laung): These flower buds have a distinctive, pungent flavor. Whole 
cloves can be used to flavor dishes, or they can be roasted and then ground 
to make Garam Masala (page 129).
Coriander seeds (dhaniya): These brownish-yellow seeds have a slightly cit-
rusy, fennel-like taste. Coriander seeds are available in most well-stocked 
grocery stores in the spice aisle. To make the ground version, dry-roast the 
seeds in a small skillet over medium-low heat until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes; 
then cool and grind to a powder. Store in an airtight container in the pantry.
Cumin seeds (jeera): One of the most popular spices in Indian cooking, 
cumin can be used whole or ground. To make the ground version, follow 
the same instructions as for ground coriander. | VEGETARIAN INDIAN INSTANT POT COOKBOOK4
Masalas for the Instant Pot
Masalas, or spice blends, are quintessential ingredients in Indian cooking. 
They add depth of flavor to dishes and can make even simple ingredients 
taste amazing. Indians use several spice blends in their daily cooking, and 
each household has its own special version. Making them from scratch will 
ensure the best and most vibrant flavor, but you can use store-bought 
versions in a pinch—just be aware that they can affect the flavor of the 
finished dish.
Traditionally, a mortar and pestle are used to grind spices. I still use 
them when I am making a small batch of masala, but I find that an electric 
spice grinder or coffee grinder is a great way to quickly grind a large 
quantity of whole spices to a fine texture.
I have included recipes for three spice blends that I use almost 
every day:
 »Garam Masala (page 129): This spicy blend is common across India and 
can be used in curries, lentils, and even rice dishes.
 »Chaat Masala (page 131): This tangy, spicy blend is used to season 
snacks known as chaat (which means “to lick” in hindi), such as Aloo 
Chaat (page 22) and Chole Chaat (page 21). This spice blend gives 
dishes their characteristic salty, spicy (and a bit funky) flavor.
 »Sambar Masala (page 130): This flavorful South Indian blend of roasted 
spices and legumes is used to make the tangy lentil and vegetable stew 
Sambar (page 47).ThE INDIAN K ITChEN  |  5
Mustard seeds (rai): These tiny seeds have a spicy, pungent flavor. You can 
use either black/brown or yellow in these recipes.
Salt: I use regular table salt for my everyday cooking. If you’re using kosher 
salt, I suggest adding a little more than the amount called for in the recipes. 
In addition to regular salt, some recipes call for black salt (kala namak). It 
has a very distinctive smell and a savory, umami taste that’s typically associ-
ated with dishes called chaat in India. Look for it in an Indian grocery store 
or online.
Turmeric (haldi): This is one of the few spices you should buy in ground 
form. Ground turmeric has a vibrant color and a slightly bitter taste that 
mellows after cooking. A little bit of this spice goes a long way.
Aromatics and Fresh Herbs
You’ll need a few basic fresh ingredients to make the recipes in this book. 
Most of them are readily available in your local grocery store.
Chiles (mirchi): I use green serrano chiles in my everyday cooking. If they’re 
too hot for you, you can remove the membrane and seeds to tone down the 
heat. As for dried chiles, I recommend buying chiles de árbol, which are 
sold in most grocery stores. Ground cayenne pepper is also commonly used. 
Keep in mind that the heat of cayenne varies between brands, so use the 
quantity listed in the recipes as a guideline and adjust accordingly.
Cilantro (kothimeer): Fresh cilantro can be used both as an ingredient in a 
dish and as a garnish. Look for fresh, vibrant-looking leaves that are 
not bruised.
Curry leaves (kari patta): These aromatic leaves are available both fresh and 
dried in Indian grocery stores. But if they are not easily accessible, feel free 
to omit them from the recipe—this will not adversely affect the taste of 
the dish.
Garlic (lasoon): Fresh garlic is used extensively in Indian cooking to add 
assertive flavor. I use either a grater or a garlic press to finely mince 
the garlic. | VEGETARIAN INDIAN INSTANT POT COOKBOOK6Ginger (adrak): Fresh ginger is a common ingredient used throughout India. 
Look for a fresh, heavy root that snaps easily and is not fibrous. A grater is 
the perfect tool to grate ginger.
Mint (pudina): Fresh mint is used in chutneys, rice dishes, and curries. The 
spearmint variety is more common in Indian cooking than peppermint.
Onions (pyaz): Most Indian recipes call for onions. You can use any variety 
you choose. I like using white and yellow onions to add subtle flavor and red 
onions to add strong flavor to dishes.
Lentils and Legumes
Dried lentils and legumes are an integral part of Indian cuisine because 
they are economical and are a wonderfully nutritious source of protein and 
fiber. Broadly known as “dal, ” lentils in one form or another have a place in 
virtually every Indian meal. Here are the lentils and legumes that are used 
in this book’s recipes.
Black-eyed peas (lobia): These buttery, creamy beans are widely available in 
cans and also frozen. They are quick and easy to cook from their dried form 
as well.
Black lentils (urad dal): For the recipes in this book, you will need both whole 
black lentils and skinned black lentils. You can easily find them in Indian 
grocery stores.
Chickpeas (kabuli chana): I always keep canned chickpeas in my pantry to 
make quick protein-packed recipes.
Mung beans (mung dal): Mung beans are one of the fastest-cooking lentils. 
You will need whole mung beans to make Spinach Mung Beans (page 38) 
and split, skinned mung beans to make Vegetable Kootu (page 48).
Peanuts: Store-bought roasted, unsalted peanuts are a pantry staple in my 
house. But you can also buy unroasted peanuts, roast them until lightly 
golden, and then store in an airtight container at room temperature for up 
to two months.ThE INDIAN K ITChEN  |  7Pigeon peas (toor dal): This is the most common type of lentil in India. You 
can easily find them in Indian grocery stores and some well-stocked  
supermarkets.
Red kidney beans (rajma): These beans have a hearty texture and aroma. 
I always have a few cans of these in the pantry.
Red lentils (masoor dal): These easy-to-cook lentils are popular all over the 
world. They are available in almost every grocery store.
Yellow split peas (chana dal): These peas are split and hulled. They are firm 
and tend to keep their shape after cooking, and they are available in 
most-well stocked grocery stores.
Dairy Ingredients
Ghee: Also known as clarified butter, ghee is available in many regular gro-
cery stores, but it can also easily be made at home in an Instant Pot 
(page 120).
Paneer: This fresh, unripened (not aged) Indian cheese can be easily made 
at home (page 121). Indian grocery stores and some specialty stores sell 
paneer in blocks in the refrigerated section.
Yogurt (dahi): Making homemade yogurt (page 122) is easy and convenient 
in an Instant Pot, but you can also use plain full-fat or 2 percent Greek 
yogurt in most recipes in this book.
Cream (malai): Use either heavy or light cream for the recipes in this book. 
Half-and-half is a suitable substitute, but the dish may not be as creamy.
Miscellaneous Ingredients
Chickpea flour (besan): Made from dried chickpeas, this pale yellow flour is 
high in dietary fiber and protein. It’s available in most well-stocked grocery 
stores and Asian markets.
Coconut milk: I prefer to use full-fat coconut milk (look for brands with no 
additives) in these recipes to add creaminess and texture, but light coconut 
milk will work, too. | VEGETARIAN INDIAN INSTANT POT COOKBOOK8
Tips for Instant Pot Success
here are a few tips that will help you get the most out of cooking with the 
Instant Pot:
 »Mise en place: This French culinary term, which means “put in place,” is 
very important for Instant Pot cooking. Measuring all the ingredients, 
chopping the produce, and getting all ingredients prepped before 
starting the recipe will make the cooking process much smoother.
 »Prevent scorching: To avoid the dreaded “burn” alert on your Instant 
Pot, deglaze the pan with liquid after sautéing and scrape the bottom to 
loosen any browned bits. If you do get the burn alert, there are a few 
things you can do: Quick release the pressure, open the pot, and scrape 
the bottom to loosen any browned bits. Add a little more water or liquid 
and continue pressure cooking. Make sure that the pressure release 
knob is set to sealing.
 »Double recipes: For most recipes, you can double the ingredients and 
use the same cooking time. Make sure not to overfill the pot, and note 
that it will take a little longer to build the pressure.
 »Successfully quick release pressure: Use quick release only for recipes 
that specifically call for it. Some vegetables will overcook if left in the 
pot for too long, but most dal and rice dishes will benefit from the 
gradual natural pressure release. Use caution when using quick release: 
Do it under a vent and keep a kitchen towel handy to cover the spout, 
if needed.
 »High-altitude cooking: If you live at a high altitude, you will have to 
adjust the cooking times because of the difference in atmospheric 
pressure. If a dish cooks under pressure for 20 minutes at sea level, then 
it would cook for 21 minutes at 3,000 feet and 23 minutes at 5,000 feet 
above sea level.ThE INDIAN K ITChEN  |  9
Rice: I recommend basmati rice grown in India or Pakistan for its fragrance 
and delicate texture, but you can also use regular long-grain rice in the 
recipes in this book. To make Idli (page 28), you need parboiled or idli rice.
Shredded coconut: You can find fresh shredded coconut in the freezer sec-
tion of your grocery store or use unsweetened coconut flakes or 
shredded coconut.
Tamarind: I recommend buying a jar of tamarind concentrate paste, which 
will last for a few months in the refrigerator. Look for it in Indian grocery 
stores or online.
Tomatoes: I prefer using vine-ripened or Roma varieties for their juiciness 
and tangy flavor. I also keep canned tomato puree and tomato paste in the 
pantry for tomato emergencies.
TECHNIQUES
Traditional Indian cooking involves some basic techniques that are used to 
build depth of flavor. These techniques can be adapted for the Instant Pot.
Toasting spices: Dry-roasting or toasting spices releases their essential oils 
and makes them more aromatic and the flavor more intense. Use the Sauté 
function on the Instant Pot to toast spices, stirring frequently until they are 
fragrant and a shade darker in color. Your nose is the best indicator of 
doneness: As soon as you smell their aroma, they are ready. Make sure to 
remove the spices from the hot pan right away to avoid burning.
Tadka (tempering): Tadka is a technique that is unique to Indian cooking. To 
temper, heat oil in the Instant Pot using the Sauté function. Once the oil is 
hot, add the whole spices and stir them around. When you hear the spices 
begin to sputter and they smell fragrant, it’s time to add the next ingredient 
or remove the spices for later use.
Bhunao (sautéing): This simple technique is a combination of sautéing, 
stir-frying, and stewing. It’s used to create rich and deeply flavored sauces. 
For this technique, use the Sauté function on the Instant Pot and add small  | VEGETARIAN INDIAN INSTANT POT COOKBOOK 10quantities of liquid, such as water or tomato puree, stirring constantly to 
prevent the ingredients from sticking to the bottom.
KITCHEN EQUIPMENT AND INSTANT 
POT ACCESSORIES
For most of the recipes in this book, you’ll need only your Instant Pot and 
some basic kitchen utensils, but there are a few other items that will come 
in handy.
Spice grinder or coffee grinder: A small grinder is great for making spice blends.
Stand blender or immersion blender: A blender is a helpful tool to blend 
ingredients to make soups, sauces, or batter for Idli (page 28).
Food processor: This appliance is a great time-saver when you need to finely 
chop ingredients and also to make chutneys.
Silicone egg bite molds: These silicone molds are a great alternative to tradi-
tional molds that you will use to make Idli (page 28). You can also use them 
to make mini Vegetable Frittatas (page 114).
Stainless steel or silicone baking pans: A six- to seven-inch round pan fits 
perfectly in a six-quart Instant Pot and can be used for pot-in-pot cooking 
when making steamed dishes like Dhokla (page 30) or Vegetable Frittata 
(page 114).
Glass lid: It’s handy to have a glass lid to use when sautéing and cooking in 
the Instant Pot without pressure. It helps trap steam and prevent sauce 
splatters. You can use any generic nine-inch glass lid with a vent hole.
ABOUT THE RECIPES
This book includes 85 recipes that primarily use the Instant Pot and its 
 various cooking modes. I have made sure to include a selection of regional 
recipes from across India as well as some restaurant favorites. I recommend ThE INDIAN K ITChEN  |  11you read a recipe thoroughly first before diving into it. Make sure you have 
all the ingredients prepped and ready to go.
Each recipe was tested and retested in a six-quart Instant Pot Duo. For 
greater meal-planning ease, in addition to including prep time and time 
cooked under pressure, I have also included the time the pot takes to come 
to pressure and, where appropriate, the time it takes to naturally 
release pressure.
Some recipes feature a label indicating that they are vegan. A super-fast  
label is included for recipes that take 30 minutes or less from prep to table.
Throughout the book I’ll provide tips and suggestions for a dish’s prepa-
ration, more information about an ingredient, or an idea for a simple swap 
to change up the recipe. There will also be tips on how to make recipes 
vegan and suggestions for how to pair recipes from the book for a complete 
meal. For even more inspiration for putting together an Indian feast, see my 
sample menu ideas on page 134.13

Mulligatawny Soup / / CREAMY LENTIL SOUP
This creamy lentil soup is a popular item on many Indian restaurant menus. 
It’s a British-Indian fusion dish made with lentils and vegetables. Apparently, 
this soup became very popular with the British soldiers stationed in India 
during the late 18th century. And when they returned home to England, they 
adapted the recipe to suit their palate. My version is vegan and flavored with 
garam masala.

Aloo Chaat / / STREET FOOD–STYLE TANGY POTATOES
Potatoes are one of India’s favorite vegetables and are widely used across the 
whole country. This tangy potato chaat is a street food from northern India. 
Vendors carry boiled potatoes and the spiced tamarind water separately and 
make this chaat on demand. It can be served as a potato salad or as a light 
meal on its own. Make sure to use waxy potatoes like fingerlings or red pota-
toes so they hold their shape well after cooking.

Kheema Pav / / VEGAN INDIAN-STYLE SLOPPY JOES
Kheema pav is a popular meat-based street food in India that’s very similar to 
American sloppy joes. Being a vegetarian, I’ve never tried it in its traditional

usually make this recipe with frozen vegan meat crumbles, but you could also 
use textured vegetable protein (aka soy granules). Serve this spicy and flavor -

Pav Bhaji / / SPICY MASHED VEGETABLES WITH DINNER ROLLS
Pav bhaji is probably one of the most popular Indian street foods sold in carts 
in Mumbai. It has gained international popularity because of its scrumptious 
taste and is now served at even fancy restaurants worldwide. It’s a spicy, but-
tery vegetable mash (bhaji) served with toasted buns (pav), raw onions, and

Idli / / STEAMED RICE CAKES
Idli is a quintessential South Indian breakfast of steamed rice cakes made with 
fermented rice and lentil batter. For years, I have tried making idli batter in 
my very chilly American kitchen and failed miserably. But using the Instant 
Pot to ferment the batter has been a game changer. Don’t be alarmed by the 
total time to make this recipe as most of it is hands-off. It takes the lentils and 
rice 6 hours to soak and then another 10 hours to ferment. But at the end of it, 
you will be rewarded with soft, fluffy idli. You will need 12 to 16 idli molds or 
silicone egg bite molds to make these.

1. Put the rice in a medium bowl and pour in enough water to cover 
the rice by 2 inches. Put the lentils in another medium bowl and 
pour in enough water to cover the lentils by 4 inches. Let the rice 
and lentils soak for 4 to 6 hours at room temperature.
2. Drain the water from the lentils and transfer them to a blender or 
food processor. Blend to a smooth mixture by adding 1/2 to 3/4 cup 
of cold water, a little at a time, as needed. Transfer the ground 
lentils to the Instant Pot.
3. Drain the water from the rice and transfer to the blender or food 
processor. Blend to a smooth mixture by adding 1/4 to 1/2 cup of cold 
water, a little at a time, as needed. Pour the ground rice mixture 
over the lentil mixture in the Instant Pot. Using clean hands, mix 
the batter. It should resemble a thick pancake batter. Add more 
water as needed to get to the desired consistency.
4. Cover the pot with a glass lid. Select Yogurt and set the timer for 
10 hours. If the batter does not ferment after 10 hours, then set the 
timer for another 2 hours. The batter should be foamy and will 
have increased in volume when ready.APPETI zERS AND S NACKS  |  29

the texture is just as creamy and buttery. This is one of my favorite dishes to 
make ahead for dinner parties because it reheats beautifully. To make the dish

Spinach Mung Beans
Whole mung beans are small, green beans that are native to India. They are 
slightly sweet and are sold as dried beans or as sprouts. They can be purchased 
from most Asian or well-stocked American groceries in the bulk goods section.  
These beans are easy to cook from dried form. In this recipe, mung beans are 
cooked with ginger and peppers to make a flavorful saucy stew that is great to 
serve as a side dish or as a meal by itself with crusty bread.

Dhansak / / PARSI VEGETABLE DAL
Dhansak is a popular dish from the Parsi community in India. Parsis are 
 Persians who migrated to the western Indian state of Gujarat between the 8th 
and 10th centuries. In this vegetarian version, vegetables and lentils are 
cooked with spices to make a flavorful stew combining Persian and  Gujarati 
cuisines beautifully. You can add up to four vegetables and even greens like 
spinach and kale—it’s a great recipe to use up those last bits of  veggies in 
the refrigerator.

Dalcha / / HYDERABADI LENTIL STEW
Dalcha is a wholesome lentil-based curry that hails from my hometown of 
Hyderabad in south-central India. In this vegetarian version, yellow split peas 
are cooked with seasonal vegetables to make a flavorful stew that pairs won-
derfully with Basic Basmati Rice (page 124). I typically use a combination of 
whatever vegetables I have on hand, but you can also make the dish with just 
one vegetable—use about 4 cups total.

garlic is lightly golden. Add the potato, carrot, green beans, cab-
bage, split peas, ginger, salt, and water. Stir to combine, making

chiles because the lentils and vegetables tone down the heat level 
considerably. But if you prefer a milder stew, use just 1 serrano chile 
and be sure to remove the seeds.

Everyday Dal
As you might guess from the name of this recipe, I make this dish almost every 
day. It also happens to be my kids’ favorite. What I love about this recipe is 
that it works for any type of lentil; only the cooking time needs to be adjusted 
(see the variation tip). It’s great to serve with rice or paratha. You can also add 
more water to thin it out and serve it as a soup.

Chayote Mung Dal
Dal is made for almost every meal in Indian homes. I am always amazed how 
my mom came up with meal plans without repeating the same dish. This 
recipe is from a dear friend who shared it when I was looking for a different

American grocery stores. It has a crisp texture that works well when cooked 
with split mung beans.

Vegetable Kootu // SOUTH INDIAN DAL WITH VEGETABLES AND COCONUT
Kootu  is a generic term used for lentil and vegetable stew in South India, 
especially in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Coconut is widely used in both these 
cuisines and forms the base of this lentil dish. You can find shredded coconut 
in the frozen section of Indian or Asian grocery stores, or you can use dried 
unsweetened shredded coconut. You might need a bit more water to grind the 
spice paste if using dried shredded coconut. My favorite vegetables for this 
dish are carrots, potatoes, and green beans, but you can also use eggplant, 
cabbage, or frozen mixed vegetables.

Chana Dal Payasam / / SPLIT PEA AND COCONUT PUDDING
This rich and flavorful payasam, or kheer, is a thin pudding that is made in 
South India. Yellow split peas are cooked until soft and then flavored with 
coconut milk and ground cardamom. This recipe is traditionally made with 
jaggery, which is an unrefined sugar. I find light or dark brown sugar is a great 
substitute. But if you can find coconut sugar, then it will taste much closer to 
the original version.

with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook until the edges are browned 
and starting to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Stir in the rice, soaking 
water, salt, and pepper and make sure to scrape the bottom to 
loosen any browned bits. Continue with the recipe as written. 
To make Vegetable Rice, add 11/2 cups of frozen mixed vegetables 
along with the rice and then follow the recipe as written.RICE D IShES  |  53
Cabbage Mint Pulao
Rice is a staple food in India and is part of at least one meal per day, so Indian 
home cooks make sure to get as creative as they can in combining vegetables 
and proteins with rice. In this recipe, rice is cooked with cabbage and an aro-
matic spice mix to make a flavorful dish. This is a great alternative to plain 
rice, or you can add 1 cup of cubed Paneer (page 121) or your favorite cooked 
or canned beans along with the rice, following the recipe as written, for a 
complete one-pot meal.

Paneer Pulao
Paneer is a protein-rich ingredient that I try to incorporate into my family’s

Biryani is a very popular Indian layered rice casserole. It’s quite 
time-consuming to make, and usually Sundays are reserved to prepare and 
enjoy this dish. Thankfully, this Instant Pot version has the same flavors but 
takes a fraction of the time. Most of the work involved is in prepping the vege-
tables. Don’t be alarmed by the long list of ingredients—the majority are 
staples. Make sure to use bay leaves and cumin seeds, but you can skip the 
others if you don’t have them on hand. Serve with Onion-Cucumber Raita 
(variation on page 123) for a delicious meal.

Egg Biryani
The Instant Pot changed my life when it comes to making hard-boiled eggs.  
It’s so convenient, and the process cannot be easier (see the cooking tip for how 
to make them). My family loves eggs, and since I’m a lacto-ovo vegetarian,  
they are one of my favorite sources of protein. For this dish, I love to crisp the 
eggs in spiced oil before adding them to the rice, but you can feel free to skip 
that step to save time.

This is the South Indian version of khichdi that screams comfort food to me. It 
has a soft texture that I think is very similar to Italian risotto. A short-grain 
rice variety like sona masoori or jasmine rice works great in this recipe 
because it gets very soft once cooked. But you can also use basmati rice; just 
be aware that the texture will be not be as fluffy. If you are not a fan of spicy 
food, reduce the peppercorns to 1/2 teaspoon and omit the chile.

Carrot Rice Pudding
Nearly every country in the world has a rice pudding recipe. Even in India, 
there are numerous ways it’s made. It’s called payasam in South India and 
kheer in the North. But essentially, it’s just slow-cooked rice, sweetened with 
sugar or jaggery (unrefined sugar) and tossed with nuts. My version includes 
carrots to add color and extra sweetness. Adjust the amount of sugar in the 
recipe to your liking.

Everyday Potato Curry
My family loves potatoes and can eat them literally every single day. This 
potato curry is my go-to recipe for a quick weeknight side dish. Any variety of 
potato will work here—just make sure to chop them into equal-size pieces. 
Add 1 cup of cubed Paneer (page 121) or cooked or canned chickpeas to make 
this a wholesome dish. Leftovers can be used as filling for sandwiches 
or wraps.

Green Beans with Coconut
Fresh coconut is widely used in many South Indian dishes. It adds slight 
sweetness and nuttiness to any dish. In this recipe, green beans are 
pressure-cooked until tender; then shredded coconut is added at the end. Feel 
free to use either fresh or dried unsweetened shredded coconut. Dried yellow 
split peas add a nice crunch and texture to the dish, but feel free to omit them 
if you don’t have them on hand.

Baingan Masala / / STUFFED EGGPLANT WITH PEANUTS
Eggplant is considered the king of vegetables in India because of its versatility 
and the fact that the stem looks like a crown. Each region in India has its own 
version of stuffed eggplant with different fillings and spices. In this version, 
baby eggplants are stuffed with a spiced peanut mixture and then cooked in 
an onion-tomato sauce for an easy, scrumptious side dish that is sure to please 
even picky eaters. Use either purple or green baby eggplants that are 2 to 
3 inches long.

and the Instant Pot makes cooking beets for this recipe easy and convenient. 
Make sure to chop the beets into small, equal-size pieces to make sure they

cook until the potatoes are slightly tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the 
tomatoes, salt, cayenne pepper, turmeric, and red pepper flakes and 
cook until the tomatoes are soft, about 1 minute. Stir in the remain-
ing 1/4 cup of water and scrape the bottom to loosen any browned 
bits. Add the cauliflower florets right on top. Do not stir.
2. Place the lid on, lock it, and close the steam valve. Set the timer for 
1 minute on high pressure.
3. When the timer sounds, quick release the pressure.
4. Open the pressure cooker and stir the cooked cauliflower into the 
curry. If there is any excess liquid, select Sauté and cook for 1 to 
2 minutes to reduce the mixture. Serve hot.
COOKING TIP: If using fresh cauliflower, chop it into big florets to 
ensure they hold their shape after cooking.CURRIES AND S TEWS   |  83

Palak Paneer / / PANEER IN CREAMY SPINACH SAUCE
A lightly spiced spinach sauce with creamy paneer makes this curry a favorite 
even with picky eaters. Don’t be surprised to see the pressure cook time of 
zero minutes—it is not a typo. The Instant Pot will come to pressure and then 
switch off. This will ensure that the spinach is not overcooked. Adjust the 
number of chiles used based on your spice preference. Remove the seeds and

Paneer Makhani / / PANEER IN BUTTERY TOMATO SAUCE
Makhani  means “butter” in Hindi. True to its name, the base of this dish is a 
rich, creamy, and buttery tomato sauce. Fresh, ripe tomatoes are great to 
use in this recipe when in season, but I find that canned tomato puree gives 
the same depth of color and flavor to the dish. If using fresh tomatoes, use 
three medium tomatoes, chopped. The paneer can be replaced with 2 cups of 
cooked or canned chickpeas, chopped extra-firm tofu, or peeled and 
chopped potatoes.

Kadai Vegetables / / SPICY VEGETABLE CURRY
Kadai  refers to the small wok that is traditionally used to make this dish. The 
freshly ground spice blend is called kadai masala because the spices are 
toasted in the kadai, which provides the characteristic flavor to this curry. 
I typically use a mix of carrots, green beans, mushrooms, and green peas to 
make this curry, but you can feel free to make it with just one or two of your 
favorite vegetables. But do not skip the bell peppers, as they provide the 
 necessary crunch that is typical of this curry.

Jalfrezi is a colorful curry made using a Chinese stir-frying technique com-
bined with Indian spices and flavors. It is a versatile dish that can be made 
with any combination of vegetables. The key is to not overcook the veggies, so 
some of them are cooked under pressure until tender while the quick-cooking 
ones are added afterward. I love adding chopped baby corn to this dish. Look

completely cooked after the set time, put the lid back on and continue to cook

Cauliflower Fried Rice
Cauliflower rice is a nutritious alternative to rice and can be used instead of 
rice in most recipes. My simple veggie-loaded recipe is quick and easy to make. 
You can make your own cauliflower rice by either grating a medium head of 
cauliflower on a box grater or processing it until very fine in a food processor. 
I use frozen edamame to add protein to the dish, but feel free to replace it with 
1 cup of firm cubed tofu or your choice of cooked or canned beans.

Bulgur Upma
Upma is a thick porridge that is typically made with semolina. My version uses 
bulgur instead because it is more easily found in the United States. If you can’t 
source it at your local grocery store, check out the bulk section of a health 
food store. I use medium-grind grain since it holds its shape better. Feel free 
to add up to 2 cups of chopped vegetables or your favorite cooked or canned

Barley is the fourth most widely grown grain crop globally after wheat, rice, 
and corn. It looks very similar to rice but has a slightly chewy texture and 
nutty flavor. I prefer pearl barley because it is quick to cook. This coconut

Even though it is not part of traditional Indian cuisine, this superfood is slowly

Spicy Tomato Pasta
My kids would happily eat pasta every single day, so I try to come up with new 
recipes to keep things interesting. This fusion dish combines a traditional 
tomato-based sauce with Indian flavors, then I add vegetables to make it col-
orful and filling. The traditional way of cooking short-cut pasta on the 
stovetop takes 9 to 12 minutes, but in the Instant Pot, that time is reduced to 
only 2 minutes. If you use a pasta that has a different cooking time, either 
increase or decrease the cooking time by 1 minute.

Kathi Rolls with Steamed Egg Filling
Kathi rolls are a popular street food in India. They are basically kebabs 
wrapped in an Indian flatbread. In this vegetarian version, I use a savory 
steamed egg cake sautéed with veggies as the filling. Steaming whisked eggs is 
a popular Asian technique that makes a fluffy, soufflé-like cake that absorbs 
any flavor added to it. For a vegan version, replace the eggs with 
crumbled tofu.

Vegetable Frittata
This veggie-loaded frittata is filling and perfect to serve for breakfast, lunch, 
or even a light dinner. I use a mix of vegetables to make it colorful and filling. 
I like to sauté the veggies until crisp-tender, which gives the spices a chance to 
cook and mellow down. But you can skip that step and just add the chopped

Manchurian-Style Meatballs
Manchurian fritters are a popular Indo-Chinese dish served in many Indian 
restaurants. Traditionally, they are crispy deep-fried vegetable fritters that are 
tossed in a tangy, spicy sauce. In my Instant Pot version, I use store-bought 
meatless meatballs instead of the fritters. They absorb the flavors beautifully 
and make this a quick and easy dish to serve with Basic Basmati Rice 
(page 124).

Ghee
Ghee is one of the primary cooking fats in India. It is made by gently browning 
unsalted butter, which results in a nutty flavor that is the key taste in many 
Indian dishes. A little goes a long way with ghee, so use it sparingly. Buy 
good-quality unsalted butter for the best flavor. I prefer using cultured butter 
over regular butter. Make sure not to leave the pot unattended because the 
difference between nutty, golden-hued ghee and burnt butter is only a 
few minutes.
SUPER-FAST

11/2 cups
Prep time: 
1 minute
Sauté: 
14 minutes
Total time: 
15 minutes1 pound (4 sticks) unsalted 
(preferably cultured) 
butter, chopped
1. Select Sauté and add the butter to the pot. It will start to melt and 
foam, but as the butter simmers the foam will subside. Cook for 
10 to 12 minutes; by this point, the milk solids (which look like little 
specks) will start to settle at the bottom of the pot and slowly turn 
a rich golden-brown color. Once the ghee (the liquid portion) turns 
clear with a golden hue, press Cancel and, wearing oven mitts, 
carefully remove the inner pot and place it on a trivet to cool.
2. Once cool enough to handle, carefully pour the ghee through a 
fine-mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth into a clean, dry, 2-cup 
mason jar. Discard the milk solids and set the ghee aside to cool 
completely before covering the jar with a lid.
COOKING TIP: Ghee can be stored at room temperature for up to 
3 months or in the refrigerator for up to 6 months.STAPLES  |  121
Paneer
Paneer is fresh cheese that is one of the most popular vegetarian proteins  
in Indian cooking. The traditional process of making it is time-consuming 
and needs some attention, but the Instant Pot makes it nearly effortless. 
Paneer is made by coagulating whole milk with vinegar. My version uses a 
combination of milk and half-and-half because I love the firmer texture of 
the resulting paneer.

5 minutes on low pressure.
3. When the timer sounds, natural release the steam for 10 minutes; 
quick release the remainder.
4. Open the pressure cooker and stir gently. The milk and cream will 
have separated into curds and watery whey.
5. Line a colander with cheesecloth, making sure to have an overhang 
on the sides, and set it in the sink. Pour the cheese and whey into 
the colander. Let it drain as it cools.
6. After about 5 minutes, gather the edges of the cheesecloth and 
fold them over to cover it and squeeze as much whey out of the 
paneer as possible.
7. Transfer the cheesecloth-wrapped paneer to a plate and place a 
large, heavy can of tomatoes or beans on it. Set it aside at room 
temperature for 2 hours to firm up and form a cohesive block.
8. Remove the weight and unwrap the firm cheese. Use it right away 
or wrap it in plastic and store in the refrigerator for up to 4 days or 
in the freezer for up to 2 months.
VARIATION: Make Spiced Paneer by adding 1 teaspoon of salt, 
1 teaspoon of cumin seeds, 1/2 teaspoon of ground coriander, and 
1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to the milk and vinegar in step 1. 
Use this flavored paneer to make Paneer Pulao (page 54). | VEGETARIAN INDIAN INSTANT POT COOKBOOK 122
Yogurt
Most households in India make fresh yogurt almost every day. Yogurt 
requires consistent, warm temperatures to ferment properly, so I had trou-
ble setting yogurt for years in my chilly American kitchen. That changed 
after I started using the Instant Pot. Now I can make thick yogurt without a 
problem. If you are making it for the first time, you will need store-bought 
yogurt that contains live cultures (it will say so on the container). After that, 
you can use some of your homemade yogurt for the starter. Don’t be 
alarmed by the long preparation time; most of that time is hands-off while 
the Instant Pot does its thing.

4. Open the pressure cooker and let the milk cool to 115°F. If you have 
an instant-read thermometer, check the temperature periodically. 
Otherwise wait 20 to 25 minutes until the milk is lukewarm to the 
touch. Add the plain yogurt to the milk and mix well to evenly 
distribute the cultures.

6. When the timer sounds, open the pressure cooker and remove the

use. The yogurt will keep in a covered container in the refrigerator 
for up to 2 weeks.
COOKING TIP: I use whole milk, but you can also use 2 percent 
or 1 percent milk. however, the texture and mouthfeel will be 
slightly different.
VARIATION: Make Onion-Cucumber Raita by combining 2 cups 
of yogurt, 1 small finely diced onion, 1 medium grated English 
cucumber, 1/2 finely chopped serrano chile, 2 tablespoons of finely 
chopped cilantro, and 3/4 teaspoon of salt in a medium bowl. Mix 
well, cover, and refrigerate until ready to serve. It will keep in the 
refrigerator for up 2 days. | VEGETARIAN INDIAN INSTANT POT COOKBOOK 124
Basic Basmati Rice
Basmati  means “the perfumed one” in Hindi, and basmati rice is one of the 
most sought-after aromatic rice varieties in the world. This naturally aged rice 
is less starchy and the grains are more slender than other long-grain rice. Add 
a tablespoon of ghee or unsalted butter while cooking to enrich the flavor.

Peanut Chutney
This is one of my favorite chutneys because it takes just 10 minutes to make 
and is perfect to serve with Idli (page 28), Vegetable Khichdi (page 62), or 
Bulgur Upma (page 104). If your peanuts are not roasted, you can roast them 
in a dry skillet over medium heat until they are evenly browned on all sides. 
Stir frequently to avoid burning them.

cumin seeds, lime or lemon juice, and water in a blender. Blend into 
a smooth puree. Add more water if the mixture looks too thick. 
Transfer the peanut mixture to a bowl.
2. In a small saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the mus-
tard seeds and cook until they start to sputter. Add the dried red 
chile and curry leaves (if using). Cook for 30 seconds, then add the 
hot oil to the peanut mixture and mix well. Serve right away.
COOKING TIP: If all you have on hand are salted peanuts, then use 
them and omit the salt in the recipe.

along with the peanuts for added flavor. | VEGETARIAN INDIAN INSTANT POT COOKBOOK 126
Paratha / / INDIAN FLATBREAD
Paratha is unleavened flatbread made daily in most Indian households. These 
flatbreads are perfect “utensils” to eat Indian curries and dal. Chapati flour, or 
atta, which is a lower-protein Indian whole-wheat flour, is traditionally used 
to make these soft, flaky parathas. It is sold in Indian or Asian grocery stores. 
If you do not have access to atta, then use half regular whole-wheat flour and 
half all-purpose flour.

more as needed
Ghee, (page 120) or 
store-bought, for

1. In a large bowl, sift the flour and salt together. Make a well in the 
center and add the oil and water. Mix with a wooden spoon until 
the dough starts to leave the sides of the bowl, adding more water 
as needed. Knead the dough on a lightly floured work surface for 
4 to 5 minutes, until it is soft and pliable, neither dry nor sticky. 
Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a kitchen 
towel, and set aside for at least 10 minutes.
2. Divide the dough into 10 equal pieces. Work with 1 portion at a 
time and keep the rest covered with a kitchen towel. On a lightly 
floured surface, roll out each portion into a 6-inch circle. Sprinkle a 
little flour on the rolled-out paratha and stack them on a plate, 
covered with a kitchen towel, while you roll out the 
remaining dough.STAPLES  |  127
3. heat a griddle or heavy-bottomed frying pan over medium-high 
heat. Carefully place a dough round on the griddle and cook for 
1 to 2 minutes, until light-brown spots start to form on the bottom. 
Turn the paratha over and cook for another minute. Make sure not 
to overcook the paratha; the cooking and turning process should 
be quick to ensure that the parathas stay soft. Keep the cooked 
parathas covered with a kitchen towel while you cook the rest. 
Brush the paratha with ghee (if using), and serve warm.
VARIATION: To make Palak Paratha (spinach paratha), blanch 
2 cups of baby spinach; then blend to a smooth puree. Use the 
spinach puree instead of water to make the dough. | VEGETARIAN INDIAN INSTANT POT COOKBOOK 128
Tomato Chutney
This is one of the most common chutneys made across India, but each region 
uses different spices to make it. My version is simple and flavored with garlic, 
cayenne pepper, and tamarind paste. I use a mild, not-too spicy variety of cay-
enne pepper, but if your pepper is spicy, reduce the amount called for in the 
recipe. This is a great recipe to make with fresh, ripe tomatoes.

COOKING TIP: I like to use either vine-ripened or Roma tomatoes 
in this recipe because they have an intense tomato flavor.STAPLES  |  129
Garam Masala
Garam masala  literally means “warming spice mix” and is probably the most 
widely used spice blend in Indian cooking. It is a mixture of whole or ground 
spices, and each region of India has its own blend. It is best to make your own 
masala because store-bought versions do not have as much flavor as freshly 
made ones.

from my friends who didn’t grow up with Indian food. But there is no mys-
tery to planning a well-balanced vegetarian Indian meal. I usually start
