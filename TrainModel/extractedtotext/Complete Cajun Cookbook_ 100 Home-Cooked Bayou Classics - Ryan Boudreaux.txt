THE CAJUN WAY
/T.ss09he essence of Cajun cooking comes from 
the Acadians, who migrated to South Loui-siana from Nova Scotia, and the ingredients, 
flavors, and techniques they used to craft the earthy charm of this cuisine. You will find many of the same ingredients and techniques repeated in numerous recipes, and yet they somehow create very distinct and different dishes.Complete Cajun Cookbook 2The Flavors of Cajun Cuisine
Despite a common misperception, Cajun foods are not overpowered with spice; 
rather, they are flavorful and tasty and have a balance of flavors from vegetables, herbs, and spices. Onions, celery, bell peppers (aka the Cajun Trinity), garlic, and parsley bring another realm of flavor to many Cajun dishes. In fact, the Trinity is the flavor foundation of most savory Cajun preparations.
Chapter /two.lin details the specific ingredients and techniques that make up 
Cajun cooking. You’ll learn about different roux preparations, flavorful meats like smoked andouille sausage and tasso, and ground-up leaves from the sassafras tree, commonly known as filé. But first you need to understand the journey that led to this unique American cuisine.
The Cajuns Come to South Louisiana
The Cajuns’ journey to the new world started in the early /one.lin/six.lin/zero.lin/zero.lins in western coastal France, where people had begun migrating to start new lives in Acadie (now Nova Scotia, Canada), where they thrived as fishers and farmers. My Boudreaux family ancestry traces back to Michel Boudrot, born around /one.lin/six.lin/zero.lin/one.lin in Cougnes, La Rochelle, France. Michel arrived in Acadie before /one.lin/six.lin/three.lin/nine.lin, where he was described as a farmer, according to a /one.lin/six.lin/seven.lin/one.lin census, and as a civil and criminal lieutenant general in a /one.lin/six.lin/eight.lin/six.lin census.
Over the next century, ownership of the Acadie colony changed hands 
several times. They experienced several wars and deportations to the colonies or to Britain and France. Many of those who evaded capture eventually migrated to Louisiana in the late /one.lin/seven.lin/zero.lin/zero.lins. By the early /one.lin/eight.lin/zero.lin/zero.lins, nearly /four.lin,/zero.lin/zero.lin/zero.lin Acadians had arrived in South Louisiana and settled into their new homes, where they eventually became known as Cajuns (an easier version of the term Acadian). The earliest known settlement of pioneer Cajuns is in Fausse Point, Louisiana. Records indicate that my ancestors likely joined the grand migration to Louisi-ana during this time and settled very close to the original settlement.
Some Cajuns settled in and around the South Louisiana bayous, swamps, 
lakes, and rivers, continuing their fishing traditions, and some settled west of the Mississippi in the plains areas, where they raised cattle or planted crops. The Cajun Way 3/T.ss09/H.ss09/E.ss09 /G.ss09/E.ss09/O.ss09/G.ss09/R.ss09/A.ss09/P.ss09/H.ss09/Y.ss09 /O.ss09/F.ss09

The bounty of natural resources in South Louisiana was one of the 
fundamental reasons the Cajuns settled in this area. The region is situated between a bustling gulf coast, threaded with rivers, and is dotted with fertile swamplands and prairies. For centuries, this area has attracted a multicultural gathering of inhabitants.
The entire Acadiana region is made up of 22 parishes (known 
as counties in all other US states), and the heartland of Cajun Country is made up of nine parishes, several of which are described here. In 1971, the Louisiana state legislature officially recognized this area for its unique Acadian heritage.
Acadia Parish is named for the original French-Canadian pro-
vincial home of the Acadian exiles. It’s dotted with rice fields and mills, and the parish seat of Crowley is nicknamed the Rice Capital of America. This is where my Boudreaux ancestors eventually set-tled and where many relatives still live today.
Lafayette Parish is named after the Marquis de Lafayette, 
the French hero of the American Revolutionary War. The city of Lafayette is host to many festivals and is known as the Boudin Capital of the World.
St. Landry Parish is the birthplace of well-known chefs Paul 
Prudhomme and Tony Chachere (known for his famous spice blend). It is the most diverse parish in terms of crops.
St. Martin Parish, located along Bayou Teche and the 
Atchafalaya Basin levee, is home to St. Martinville, the parish seat. It’s one of Louisiana’s oldest towns and is considered the birthplace of Cajun culture.Ö/T.ss09/H.ss09/E.ss09 /G.ss09/E.ss09/O.ss09/G.ss09/R.ss09/A.ss09/P.ss09/H.ss09/Y.ss09 /O.ss09/F.ss09 Ö/T.ss09/H.ss09/E.ss09 /G.ss09/E.ss09/O.ss09/G.ss09/R.ss09/A.ss09/P.ss09/H.ss09/Y.ss09 /O.ss09/F.ss09

ideas as they made their way into the existing communities of Native American Indians, Africans, and immigrants from Europe, Asia, and South America.
The Evolution of a Way of Cooking
Cajun immigrants adapted to the bounty of wild vegetation, seafood, and wild game in their new home of Louisiana with passion and dedication, building a new culinary culture and creating new food traditions. Cajun cooking evolved to create hearty country food, made simply from local ingredients, to sustain hard-working folks. This new way of cooking was influenced by local Native American tribes, along with Spanish, German, and Italian settlers. They all learned from one another, evolving their way of cooking to accommodate what the land offered.
THE BOUNTY OF A NEW WORLD
Cajuns learned of foods native to the region, including the sassafras tree, corn, and local herbs and spices. Filé powder, popular in gumbo recipes, is made from the ground leaves of the sassafras tree, and the tree roots are used to make teas and beverages. Cajuns developed Corn Maque Choux (page /one.lin/five.lin/five.lin) from the abundance of corn. Initially, corn was the primary cultivated crop and staple of the Cajun diet, but eventually rice replaced it. Rice is well suited to the low-lying areas that are frequently flooded in spring.
To supplement their crops, Cajuns learned how to fish the gulf, rivers, 
swamps, and bayous, catching a variety of seafood, fish, alligators, frogs, and turtles. Crawfish, shrimp, redfish, perch, trout, and oysters worked their way into the Cajun diet.
Cajuns hunted a host of wild game animals and birds in the region and 
began adding them to their diet. Species indigenous to the area included wild boar, black bear, nutria, rabbit, beaver, possum, squirrel, raccoon, duck, teal, dove, quail, pheasant, goose, and wild turkey.The Cajun Way 5/T.ss09/H.ss09/E.ss09 /C.ss09/A.ss09/M.ss09/P.ss09 /T.ss09/R.ss09/A.ss09/D.ss09/I.ss09/T.ss09/I.ss09/O.ss09/N.ss09
Cajuns originally built dwellings near low-lying prairielands and 
along the waterways of bayous, rivers, lakes, streams, and swamp-lands as a base for hunting and fishing and for subsistence living off the land.
Industrialization and modernization, however, changed the 
way Cajuns lived. As small communities urbanized into towns and cities, Cajuns began to move away from the outlying prairielands, swamps, bayous, and rivers. The influx of oil companies in South Louisiana provided a host of attractive, high-paying job opportu-nities with benefits that far outweighed the meager livelihood of the indigent Cajuns. All these trends—plus the Education Act of 1916, which mandated that English be spoken in schools—led to the Americanization of the Cajuns. Many began leaving their original homes on the prairies and waterways but continued to maintain them for continued access to the wild game, waterfowl, alligators, and seafood they loved.
These old dwellings became known as camps. They were 
designated according to the location and primary resource of the area (duck camp, fish camp, and deer camp, to name a few). As the demands of new opportunities required more time away from home, these camps turned into weekend getaways or vacation spots. Camps became places to enjoy hobbies and gathering spots for family reunions.Ö/T.ss09/H.ss09/E.ss09 /C.ss09/A.ss09/M.ss09/P.ss09 /T.ss09/R.ss09/A.ss09/D.ss09/I.ss09/T.ss09/I.ss09/O.ss09/N.ss09Ö/T.ss09/H.ss09/E.ss09 /C.ss09/A.ss09/M.ss09/P.ss09 /T.ss09/R.ss09/A.ss09/D.ss09/I.ss09/T.ss09/I.ss09/O.ss09/N.ss09Complete Cajun Cookbook 6THE INFLUENCE OF OTHER CULTURES
Many cultures arrived in Louisiana on ships and found new homes all along 
South Louisiana, adding their influences. Some cultures were already thriving in Louisiana, and they too made their mark on Cajun culture.
When the Cajuns arrived, they encountered many well-established Native 
American tribes, including the Choctaw, Chitimacha, Houma, Tunica-Biloxi, Caddo, and Koasati. The natives introduced the Cajuns to indigenous plants, animals, and local traditions.
Enslaved Africans started arriving in Louisiana via New Orleans around 
/one.lin/seven.lin/one.lin/nine.lin. Africans made significant contributions to rice cultivation and introduced okra. In fact, the West African word okra is the root meaning of the modern term for gumbo.
German immigrants started arriving in South Louisiana around /one.lin/eight.lin/eight.lin/zero.lin and 
brought with them methods for smoking and preserving meat as well as meth-ods of making sausage, beer, and bread.
Italian immigrants, mostly Sicilians, started migrating to Louisiana in the 
/one.lin/eight.lin/zero.lin/zero.lins. They merged their recipes with the indigenous ingredients of Louisiana, creating a Creole-Cajun-Italian cuisine of their own. Oysters, prolific in Louisi-ana coastal waters, replaced clams, and rice began to accompany pasta in their dishes. Italians also brought their love of making pasta. The two-way influences between Italian and Cajun or Creole cuisine are still going strong today in places like New Orleans’ famous Pascal’s Manale Restaurant and Central Gro-cery, which is known for its muffuletta.
THE IMPORTANCE OF CATHOLICISM
Most Cajuns maintained their Catholic religious practices after settling in Loui-siana. One of the most notable Catholic traditions is the celebration of Lent, the /four.lin/zero.lin days starting with Ash Wednesday and ending with Easter. Many Catholics give up red meat in their meals during Lent, and Cajuns found the bounty of seafood and greens to be perfect substitutions. Gumbo Z’Herbes (page /six.lin/zero.lin) is a perfect example of a meatless gumbo, prepared with up to /one.lin/one.lin different greens and vegetable tops, and is quite popular during Lent. Fried fish on Holy Friday gradually became a popular tradition to enjoy on all Fridays during Lent. It became so popular that many restaurants and cafés now offer fried fish specials every Friday of the year.The Cajun Way 7/C.ss09/R.ss09/E.ss09/O.ss09/L.ss09/E.ss09 /C.ss09/O.ss09/O.ss09/K.ss09/I.ss09/N.ss09/G.ss09

“Creole” is a word that describes the population of people in 
French colonial Louisiana. This mélange primarily includes descen-dants of African, French, Spanish, Native American, German, Irish, and Italian immigrants and others who married into these groups. Creole cuisine evolved from these cultures and became known for its more refined, aristocratic cooking style compared with Cajun cooking. Most Creoles resided in and around the city of New Orleans, separating themselves from the country lifestyle of the Cajuns.
The distinctive lines between Cajun and Creole cooking are 
blurred today. There is no agreed-upon official definition of Creole cuisine, and many recipes from both cuisines use the same ingre-dients. One of the few distinctions between the two cuisines is that Creole preparations often include tomatoes but Cajun recipes generally do not. For example, a Creole jambalaya will be red from the addition of tomato paste, tomato puree, and/or diced toma-toes, but a Cajun jambalaya will not include tomatoes and will have a brown color. Another distinction is that most Creole cuisine was created in New Orleans and is considered city food, and most Cajun cuisine developed in the Acadiana region of Louisiana and is known as country food.
Several old-line Creole restaurants are still in operation in 
New Orleans today. These places, which celebrate traditional fare, include Galatoire’s Restaurant, Antoine’s Restaurant, Dooky Chase, and Commander’s Palace.Ö/C.ss09/R.ss09/E.ss09/O.ss09/L.ss09/E.ss09 /C.ss09/O.ss09/O.ss09/K.ss09/I.ss09/N.ss09/G.ss09 Ö/C.ss09/R.ss09/E.ss09/O.ss09/L.ss09/E.ss09 /C.ss09/O.ss09/O.ss09/K.ss09/I.ss09/N.ss09/G.ss09

Louisiana Catholics construct altars to honor the relief that St. Joseph provided 
during a famine in Sicily. Because the altars honor the saint for relieving star-vation, they often feature a cornucopia of food offerings on which everyone can feast.
Cooking with the Seasons
Living off the land meant Cajuns had to take what nature gave them, changing their hunting, fishing, and farming practices with the seasons. In Louisiana, we name the seasons based more on the predominant foods available instead of by the average temperatures and length of sunlight during the day. For instance:
•Crawfish season: late winter through early summer
•Crab season: late spring through early fall
•Shrimp season: May through July for brown; April through December 
for white
•Oyster season: October through April
Following are some of the other so-called seasons Cajuns have observed.
BOUCHERIE
The boucherie (literally translated “butchery”), an event to slaughter a pig, fell anytime from late October to early March. Before modern refrigeration, time was of the essence to get the pig prepared, slaughtered, butchered, broken down, and cured, smoked, or cooked. The community of neighbors and family gathered to help, and everyone reaped the benefits and shared in the spoils. Modern refriger-ation and processing have obviated the need for community effort, so today the tradition continues mostly as a tribute to the old way of life.
The pig provides meat for an array of dishes, including liver for boudin, 
backbone for stew, ground pork for sausage, skin for cracklings, head for hog head cheese, loins for chops, pork legs for curing ham, belly for bacon, and cubed pork meat for jambalaya.The Cajun Way 9SUGARCANE HARVEST
Sugarcane is grown in many of the Acadiana parishes, and harvest time is 
September through January. According to USDA reports, Louisiana set a record with just under /two.lin million tons of sugarcane produced in /two.lin/zero.lin/two.lin/one.lin, making it the number-one crop in the state. South Louisiana, with its marshlands and swamps, is well suited to growing this water-intensive crop. Many Cajun sauces and des-serts use cane syrup and cane sugar.
RICE HARVEST
South Louisiana is the primary region for optimal rice crops. The topography, with relatively flat plains between the Atchafalaya Basin on the east and Lake Charles on the west, helps make Louisiana the third-largest rice-producing state in the country. August is the peak of rice harvest season, which typically runs for about /one.lin/two.lin/zero.lin days from midsummer to early fall.
Cajun cuisine has largely been formed around rice, ever since early Cajun 
settlers brought rice from the Carolinas during their migration and started sowing rice seeds into wetlands. Commercial rice production began in the late /one.lin/nine.linth century. In fact, in /one.lin/nine.lin/three.lin/seven.lin, Crowley, Louisiana, started hosting an annual Rice Festival as a way to celebrate the rice industry. Also known as the Rice Capital of America, Crowley is in the heart of the Cajun Prairie, where you can visit the Rice Interpretive Center, stop at the Historic Rice Theater, take the Rice Trail Driving Tour, or visit one of many Cajun cuisine restaurants.
STRAWBERRY HARVEST
The official state fruit of Louisiana is the strawberry, and the state is known for/uni00A0the sweetest, juiciest, and plumpest varieties. Ponchatoula, Louisiana, hosts the Ponchatoula Strawberry Festival every year in April, the peak month of strawberry-picking season. Strawberries are in season from mid-March through the end of May.
PECAN HARVEST
In /one.lin/eight.lin/seven.lin/six.lin, farmers successfully planted the Centennial pecan, which improved grafting techniques and allowed farmers to commercialize pecans, creating an abundance. Cajuns took note and began incorporating them into dishes like Complete Cajun Cookbook 10Pecan Praline Pie (page /one.lin/seven.lin/five.lin), Pecan Pralines (page /one.lin/six.lin/two.lin), and Divinity (page /one.lin/seven.lin/one.lin). 
Pecans are ready for harvest when the outer hulls begin to split open and the pecan nuts start falling to the ground. The annual pecan harvest lasts for /nine.lin/zero.lin to /one.lin/two.lin/zero.lin days between September and December each year, which is perfect timing for making holiday treats. The Louisiana Pecan Festival is held in Novem-ber in Colfax, Grant Parish, Louisiana.
Celebrating Cajun Style
Cajun celebrations follow the Christian calendar of Feast Days. Many Cajuns still follow the Christian traditions, but in a decidedly South Louisiana way.
FEAST DAYS
A feast day is closely tied to a specific saint representing a date on the Christian calendar. The broad definition of “feast” in this context is a religious celebration of the particular saint, not a large meal. But Louisianans and Cajuns always love a reason to spin food into their celebrations, so many feast days in Louisiana are defined by cooking and meals.
ALL SAINTS’ DAY
A holy day of obligation in the Catholic church, November /one.lin is All Saints’ Day, also known as All Hallows’ Day or the Feast of All Saints. All Saints’ Day is for celebrating and honoring loved ones and paying respect to those who came and went before. Many Cajun families bring their picnic foods in baskets and set up on the greens surrounding the cemeteries, where they socialize and remember their loved ones.
THANKSGIVING
A Cajun Thanksgiving spread always overflows with way too much food. Cajuns historically celebrated Thanksgiving with the boucherie, where the family would enjoy a feast of boudin, cracklings, sausage, and pork roast. When the traditional boucherie fell out of custom, the pork dishes were replaced with turkey and goose. Families differ on their preferred dressing; the debate is usually between The Cajun Way 11an oyster dressing or a rice-and-meat dressing. Some Cajuns serve a jambalaya 
as their rice-and-meat dressing.
Common dishes served at Thanksgiving and found in this cookbook 
include deep-fried turkey (see the sidebar on this page), Chicken and Sausage Gumbo (page /six.lin/four.lin), Chicken and Andouille Jambalaya (page /nine.lin/zero.lin), Cajun Dirty Rice (page /nine.lin/two.lin), Bourbon Yams (page /one.lin/four.lin/four.lin), Spinach, Oyster, and Artichoke  Casserole (page /one.lin/four.lin/eight.lin), Pecan Pralines (page /one.lin/six.lin/two.lin), and Fig Pecan Pie (page /one.lin/seven.lin/two.lin)./G.ss09/O.ss09/I.ss09/N.ss09/G.ss09 /B.ss09/I.ss09/G.ss09:

I’ve never tasted more succulent, juicy, and tender turkey breast 
meat than the deep-fried turkey we’ve made for Thanksgiving and Christmas. It has become so popular that many folks don’t wait for the holidays; I’ve seen tailgaters at LSU football games frying up turkeys.
Deep-frying a turkey requires a big pot and a large propane 
burner that can fit a 15- to 20-pound bird but won’t allow the oil to boil over. A long-probe deep-fat thermometer is an essential tool to monitor and maintain the optimum oil temperature of 325˚F. The lower fry temperature gives the turkey more time for even cooking so the outside is not dried out before the inside is cooked.
Step one involves seasoning your bird. Some people inject the 
raw turkey with seasoned melted butter using a turkey injector. Others brine their turkey, which is a good way to add moisture to the cooked meat. Next, you dry the turkey, measure the correct amount of oil, and deep-fry the bird (in an open place, not near your house) for 4 to 5 minutes per pound, or until the internal temperature of the breast meat is 160˚F. Rest for 15 minutes before carving.Ö/G.ss09/O.ss09/I.ss09/N.ss09/G.ss09 /B.ss09/I.ss09/G.ss09: Ö/G.ss09/O.ss09/I.ss09/N.ss09/G.ss09 /B.ss09/I.ss09/G.ss09:

One special aspect of a Cajun Christmas is that every family has its own tradi-
tions and meals. Christmas meals often highlight freshly cured ham from the boucherie or recently hunted and dressed duck or goose. Some of the foods that/uni00A0make a great Cajun Christmas dinner include Duck and Andouille Gumbo (page /six.lin/six.lin), Roasted Goose (page /one.lin/zero.lin/one.lin), Turducken (see page /two.lin/zero.lin), Pecan Rice Dressing (page /eight.lin/nine.lin), Ambrosia (page /one.lin/three.lin/seven.lin), Divinity (page /one.lin/seven.lin/one.lin), and Bread Pud-ding Soufflé (page /one.lin/six.lin/eight.lin).
Cajun Christmas traditions include attending the midnight mass on Christ-
mas Eve and then returning home late at night to celebrate with a big pot of gumbo. Gathered around the campfire on Christmas Eve, elders would read The Cajun Night Before Christmas. This story tells the tale of Santa Claus dressed in muskrat pelts and pulling his flying skiff with alligators through the swamps, delivering toys and gifts to all the Cajun children.
Christmas bonfires along the Mississippi River in St. James Parish and 
St. John the Baptist Parish have been lit on the levees since the mid-/one.lin/eight.lin/zero.lin/zero.lins and/uni00A0stretch some /three.lin/zero.lin to /four.lin/zero.lin miles upriver from New Orleans. The bonfire  tradition also came from France. Initially set for New Year’s Eve, the tradition was moved to Christmas Eve—some say to provide Santa with a lighted path during the night. Local groups spend weeks setting up and standing guard on their individual log setup, each made with log-cabin-style stacked timber as high as /two.lin/zero.lin feet. Some groups offer free gumbo to those who come to view their bonfire.
NEW YEAR’S EVE
Cajuns traditionally rang in the New Year firing shotguns and blowing up fire-works. Foods commonly served on New Year’s include Smothered Black-Eyed Peas (page /one.lin/four.lin/zero.lin) and Cabbage Casserole (page /one.lin/five.lin/three.lin). Tradition holds that pork brings happiness, black-eyed peas offer good luck, and cabbage embodies wealth. The more you eat, the more benefits you gain. A well-rounded Cajun New Year’s meal is complete with a serving of Corn Bread (page /one.lin/five.lin/four.lin).The Cajun Way 13MARDI GRAS
Mardi Gras is French for “Fat Tuesday.” It’s celebrated every year on the Tuesday 
before Ash Wednesday, which marks the first day of Lent. The name comes from the practice of people indulging in food, drink, and merriment before giving up something or fasting for the season of Lent. It’s one last hurrah.
Although New Orleans is the epicenter of Mardi Gras celebrations—known 
for its balls, parades, and festivities—Cajuns celebrate the holiday differently, with Courir de Mardi Gras. It is also known as the Fat Tuesday Run, a rural Cajun celebration where costumed folks hide their identity as they partake in heavy eating and drinking. Then they begin a frenzied foot race across prairies and around bayous, stopping to put on animated performances and begging at predetermined locations in exchange for food. The event includes rewarding the best acts with chickens or other foods. It can be a rowdy affair of eating, drink-ing, chasing chickens, and dancing all day long.
EASTER
Besides rejoicing the end of Lent, Easter celebrates the resurrection of Christ. Cajuns love to celebrate Easter with a good sugar-cured ham, deviled eggs, Seafood Gumbo (page /six.lin/two.lin), and Crawfish Boil (page /one.lin/two.lin/one.lin). Cajuns also celebrate Easter with an egg-knocking game called paqueing, in which two opponents hold Easter eggs in clenched hands and knock their eggs against each other. If your opponent’s egg cracks, you win, and you get to keep their egg. In Cajun rural communities, if you owned the chicken that laid the egg with the hardest shell, it was a badge of honor.
An Ever-Evolving Cuisine
Cajun cuisine has changed from the early days of cooking off the land with limited ingredients prepared in cast-iron cauldrons on wood-burning fires. These days, you’re more likely to find modern kitchens with a plethora of pots, pans, and utensils and a world of ingredients available at contemporary grocery stores. Yet Cajun cooking is still essentially a melting pot of many cultures that makes a uniquely American cuisine.15[]

THE CAJUN KITCHEN
/W.ss09hat do you typically find in a Cajun 
kitchen? The pantry might be stocked with cane syrup, Louisiana hot sauce, 
filé powder, liquid smoke, rice, cayenne pepper, and stone-ground grits.

The freezer may hold a supply of crawfish tails, shrimp, redfish, and ducks. Now I’ll be more specific.Complete Cajun Cookbook 16Ingredients That Define Cajun Cooking
The ingredients highlighted in this section separate Cajun cuisine from all 
others. As Cajuns adapted to the deep South Louisiana countryside, they embraced what the land had to offer, which resulted in the evolution of Cajun cuisine as we know it today.
ALLIGATOR
Louisiana boasts one of the largest populations of alligators, with more than a million roaming the coastal marshes, swamps, and bayous. Alligator meat is primarily obtained from the tail section, and it can be grilled, fried, and used as the main meat ingredient in gumbo, étoufée, and sauce picante as well as in my recipe for Alligator Chili (page /one.lin/two.lin/three.lin). Many Cajuns say alligator is the chicken of the swamp. It has a mild flavor with a firm texture and tastes similar to quail with a hint of fishiness. 
ANDOUILLE
Pronounced “ahn-DOO-wee,” this spicy sausage is made with coarse-cut pork shoulder, pork butt, pork shank, and pork fat and spiced with black pepper and other seasonings. The filling is encased in beef middle casing, after which it gets cold smoked with sugarcane, hickory, or pecan wood.
BOUDIN
Pronounced “BOO-dan,” this sausage is made with pork, pork liver, and rice in a sausage casing. The typical Cajun recipe is a boudin blanc, or white sausage, and is either boiled or grilled. Make your own with the recipe on page /two.lin/nine.lin.
CANE SYRUP
Another popular product in Louisiana that is found in many Cajun recipes is pure cane syrup. Cane syrup has a sweet, molasses-like flavor (but not as bitter) with a maple syrup consistency. In this book you will find it used in Pain Perdu (page /two.lin/six.lin), Couche Couche (page /two.lin/seven.lin), Biscuits (page /three.lin/zero.lin), Braised Pork Chops The Cajun Kitchen 17(page /eight.lin/five.lin), and others. My favorite is Steen’s Cane Syrup, still produced today in 
its original location of Abbeville, Louisiana. 
CREOLE MUSTARD
This spicy mustard has its roots in Cajun and Creole cuisine. It appears in many recipes and preparations, including Crawfish Cakes (page /four.lin/eight.lin) and remoulade sauce for Shrimp Remoulade (page /four.lin/four.lin). Originally created in the late /one.lin/eight.lin/zero.lin/zero.lins, it’s one of the original products created and sold by Zatarain’s, the classic local brand and my personal favorite. If you have trouble finding it, you can substitute any whole-grain Dijon-style mustard.
CRAWFISH
Although Cajuns cook just about everything that swims in the water (and there are lots of options in Louisiana), the highlight of local seafood is the crawfish. Because they are so plentiful in the region, crawfish were the main source of protein for many Cajuns. Peak season is spring. Crawfish are similar to lobster in texture, but more flavorful in taste. They are kept alive until boiled; then the tails (the primary source of meat) are peeled, and the meat is picked out and eaten while hot.
GUMBO FILÉ
Filé powder, made from ground leaves of the sassafras tree, is commonly known as gumbo filé because the powder is added to gumbo as both a flavor enhancer and a thickener. The flavor is mildly earthy with hints of savory, thyme, and root beer and a lingering tiny note of citrus. Its origins of use go back to the Choctaw Indians of the region, who used the dried, ground leaves as a seasoning. 
HOT SAUCE
Louisiana-style hot sauce is primarily made with aged red chile peppers (either tabasco or cayenne), distilled white vinegar, and salt. The peppers are brought to a boil with vinegar and salt and then steeped until soft. Once cooled, the mixture is blended into a purée, strained, bottled, and stored for several weeks, which allows the flavors to meld. My favorite brand is Crystal Hot Sauce, which is mild and not too overpowering. Complete Cajun Cookbook 18MIRLITON
Also known as the vegetable pear or chayote, the mirliton is the favored Cajun 
gourd-like squash vegetable. It’s great in casseroles, in soups, or stuffed with shrimp, as highlighted in my recipe for Shrimp-Stuffed Mirliton (page /one.lin/four.lin/two.lin). It’s also easy to grow along a fence or trellis.
OKRA
One of the common ingredients in gumbo, okra is a summer vegetable grown in just about every Cajun garden. Stewed down with tomatoes, Smothered Okra (page /one.lin/five.lin/one.lin) is terrific served as a side or as a meal over rice.
RICE
Many Cajun dishes and recipes include rice, whether cooked into the dish, on the side, or as a bed for the preparation to lie over. Crowley, Louisiana, remains the rice capital of America. In its heyday, my family’s farm grew rice every year and sold it to the local processors in Crowley.

The Holy Trinity of Cajun cooking refers to the iconic trio of vege-
tables that forms the base of many Cajun dishes: chopped/uni00A0onion, chopped celery, and chopped green bell pepper. The Trinity is a variant of the French mirepoix, which is a mixture of onion, celery, and carrot that adds flavors to so many French dishes. The bell pepper replaced the carrot because it grew more easily in South Louisiana. The Trinity is found in a majority of Cajun recipes and is the foundation of flavor; some call it seasoning because it’s the base for all other ingredients. The Trinity is one part each onion, celery, and bell pepper, but sometimes people tinker with the ratio.Ö/T.ss09/H.ss09/E.ss09 /H.ss09/O.ss09/L.ss09/Y.ss09 /T.ss09/R.ss09/I.ss09/N.ss09/I.ss09/T.ss09/Y.ss09Ö/T.ss09/H.ss09/E.ss09 /H.ss09/O.ss09/L.ss09/Y.ss09 /T.ss09/R.ss09/I.ss09/N.ss09/I.ss09/T.ss09/Y.ss09The Cajun Kitchen 19TASSO
This highly spiced pork shoulder is cured and then smoked until dried. You 
can buy it or make it yourself (page /eight.lin/four.lin). Tasso imparts a spicy and smoky background flavor for recipes like gumbo, jambalaya, and cream sauces, or you can just slice it into thin strips and serve it alongside cheese and crackers on a charcuterie board./C.ss09/A.ss09/J.ss09/U.ss09/N.ss09 /S.ss09/E.ss09/A.ss09/S.ss09/O.ss09/N.ss09/I.ss09/N.ss09/G.ss09

Common Cajun cooking methods include thickening and flavoring stews, 
sauces, and gumbo with a roux and smothering foods with liquids such as stocks, wines, or broths on the stovetop. Panfrying is common in the Cajun repertoire for browning meats, poultry, or fish. This technique uses just enough fat to cover about one-third of the food. Deep-frying is commonly used in the Cajun kitchen for any breaded or battered meat, fish, or poultry, requiring several quarts of oil in a large, deep stockpot or countertop fryer. Cajuns love to grill and smoke their meats, too; andouille sausage is one example of smoked meat.

Several groups have claimed the origin of turducken as their own. 
This notorious combination—a deboned chicken, stuffed into a deboned duck, which is in turn stuffed into a deboned turkey—can weigh between 25 and 30 pounds. Cajun Chef Paul Prudhomme is noted for bringing turducken into popular culture at his restau-rant K’Paul’s Louisiana Kitchen in the 1970s, and he trademarked the name in 1986. Hebert’s Specialty Meats in Maurice, Louisiana, however, claims the first record of selling the turducken around 1985. According to Hebert’s, a local man brought in his catch of three birds and asked them to create the medley. No matter the true origin, a well-made turducken is a culinary experience not to be missed.Ö/T.ss09/H.ss09/E.ss09 /S.ss09/T.ss09/O.ss09/R.ss09/Y.ss09 /O.ss09/F.ss09 Ö/T.ss09/H.ss09/E.ss09 /S.ss09/T.ss09/O.ss09/R.ss09/Y.ss09 /O.ss09/F.ss09

One of the first things you do in many Cajun and Creole recipes is make a 
roux. A roux is equal parts fat and flour. Roux can range in cooking time and color from the quick, light roux, which takes just a few minutes, to the darkest brick-red roux, which can take up to /three.lin/zero.lin minutes. The quick roux has the most thickening power and the lightest color and is used to thicken milk- or light stock–based sauces and cream soups. The blond roux is cooked just a bit longer and takes on more flavor, does not lose much of its thickening power, and is commonly used for making béchamel sauce and cream soups. The longer a roux cooks, the less thickening power it has. At the same time, however, it gains more flavor and imparts a nutty, toasty taste and aroma. Darker roux is used for gumbo, étoufée, and fricassee recipes.
SMOTHERING
The Cajun and Creole technique of smothering means cooking meat, seafood, poultry, or vegetables in their own juices in the stovetop skillet. Essentially, it’s a form of braising. Some folks add additional liquids in the form of stock or water, some thicken the liquid with a roux, and some thicken with a cornstarch or flour slurry. Smothered Okra (page /one.lin/five.lin/one.lin), Snap Beans and Potatoes (page /one.lin/three.lin/eight.lin), and Smothered Black-Eyed Peas (page /one.lin/four.lin/zero.lin) are examples of cooking down, or smoth-ering, vegetables.
FRICASSEEING
The Cajun fricassee method has its roots in French cuisine. It’s a combination of a sauté and a stew and is typically made with chicken but may include rabbit and veal. The meat is sautéed first; then other ingredients are added and stewed down. Chicken Fricassee (page /one.lin/zero.lin/four.lin) has pieces of chicken stewed down with the Cajun Trinity, garlic, mushrooms, and lima beans.
PANFRYING
Using a minimal amount of fat, panfrying entails cooking meat, fish, or poultry over medium-low heat in a pan or cast-iron skillet until browned on all sides. All meats are seasoned prior to panfrying, and some meats are lightly dusted with flour or dipped into a light batter before cooking.Complete Cajun Cookbook 22DEEP/hyphen.linFRYING
Cajuns love their deep-fried foods; fried catfish is at the top of the list, especially 
served with a side of slaw. Recipes that use the deep-frying method include Shrimp Puffs (page /four.lin/seven.lin), Catfish Bites (page /five.lin/three.lin), and Les Oreilles de Cochon (page /one.lin/six.lin/six.lin). Peanut oil is the popular choice for deep-frying because it adds a level of flavor that other oils do not. It also has a high smoke point of /four.lin/five.lin/zero.lin˚F, which keeps fried food from burning or catching fire.
GRILLING AND SMOKING
Grilling and smoking foods was probably one of the first cooking methods early Cajuns used before the modern-day kitchen. Although they never gave up this technique, Cajuns went back to their roots and were reunited with their grills and smokers for many weeks after Hurricane Katrina because of gas and elec-tricity outages. Grilled and smoked meats, seafood, and poultry are all in the Cajun arsenal. In this book, you will find several examples, including Grilled Redfish on the Half Shell (page /one.lin/two.lin/nine.lin) and Grilled Oysters (page /one.lin/three.lin/three.lin).
Cajun Cookware
These are the essential tools needed for Cajun cooking generally (although you might want to grab a food processor and an electric mixer as well) and for the recipes in this book specifically.
/one.lin/two.lin/hyphen.linINCH CAST/hyphen.linIRON /parenleft.linOVEN/hyphen.linSAFE/parenright.lin SKILLET
Many of the recipes in this cookbook use a /one.lin/two.lin-inch cast-iron skillet because it holds heat longer and does not burn foods as easily.
DUTCH OVEN
Dutch ovens come in many sizes, ranging in capacity from /one.lin to /two.lin/zero.lin quarts, but most recipes in this book use a cast-iron /six.lin-quart one. Many Dutch ovens include a cast-iron lid, which is where the “oven” part of the name comes from.The Cajun Kitchen 23/six.lin/hyphen.linQUART, /one.lin/two.lin/hyphen.linQUART, AND /two.lin/zero.lin/hyphen.linQUART STOCKPOTS
Stockpots range in size from /one.lin to /six.lin/two.lin quarts, but most Cajun kitchens include 
/six.lin-quart, /one.lin/two.lin-quart, and /two.lin/zero.lin-quart pots. You will find several recipes that call for the /six.lin-quart or /one.lin/two.lin-quart stockpots and just a few that call for the /two.lin/zero.lin-quart stockpot. Stockpots are used for soups, stews, smothered foods, and boils.
/nine.lin/hyphen.linBY/hyphen.lin/one.lin/three.lin/hyphen.linINCH CASSEROLE DISH
Cajuns love to make casseroles for large family gatherings and potluck meals, and the /nine.lin-by-/one.lin/three.lin-inch dish is the perfect vessel for feeding a lot of people at once. They can be ceramic, nonstick, glass, or stoneware.
About the Recipes
The /one.lin/zero.lin/zero.lin recipes selected for this cookbook represent all that I love about Loui-siana Cajun food and cooking. With thousands of great recipes that Cajuns have handed down from generation to generation, I have selected a collection dear to my heart and one that I hope represents what it means to cook in the Cajun tradition.
At the end of many recipes you will find a 
“LAGNIAPPE TIP.” Lagniappe
literally means “a little something extra.” In this case, it is an extra tidbit of Cajun culture, history, lore, or kitchen wisdom for the recipes. Some recipes also include substitution suggestions for items that might not be readily available.25[]

“Lost Bread,” the French bread version of traditional French toast, is a popular 
breakfast tradition in New Orleans. This dish originated as a way for the frugal Cajuns to use up stale French bread, so nothing goes to waste.
PREP TIME:
40 MINUTES
COOK TIME:
15 MINUTES
SERVES 43 large eggs
1 cup heavy cream⅓    cup orange juice¼    cup granulated sugar1 tablespoon ground cinnamon1 tablespoon vanilla extract1 teaspoon ground nutmeg½    teaspoon table salt1 loaf stale French bread, cut 
into 8 (2-inch-thick) slices
4 tablespoons (½    stick) 
unsalted butter, divided
⅔    cup powdered sugar1 cup Steen’s Cane Syrup (or 
maple syrup), warmed
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, heavy cream, 
orange juice, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla extract, nutmeg, and salt. Add the French bread slices and let them soak for at least 30 minutes, turning them over about halfway through to evenly absorb the liquid.
2. In a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Working in two batches, place 4 soaked French bread slices in the skillet, and cook until golden brown on each side, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the first 4 slices to a serving platter and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and soaked French bread slices.
3. Dust with the powdered sugar, and serve with cane syrup.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: Steen’s Cane Syrup is produced in Abbeville, Louisiana, 
from sugarcane. It has a molasses-like flavor, but not as bitter. If you can’t find it in your grocery store, you can order it directly from Steen’s (see Resources, page 186).Breakfast 27/C.ss09/o.ss09/u.ss09/c.ss09/h.ss09/e.ss09 /C.ss09/o.ss09/u.ss09/c.ss09/h.ss09/e.ss09 
A true Cajun breakfast, this warm cornmeal mush is pronounced “coosh coosh.” 
It’s served in a bowl with cane syrup and milk or cream. On occasions when my dad, Joseph, was in a hurry, he mashed up a large square of leftover corn bread with a spoon, sprinkled some sugar on top, and poured ice-cold milk over it to make his own version of cold couche couche.
PREP TIME:
10 MINUTES
COOK TIME:
15 MINUTES
SERVES 42 cups all-purpose white 
cornmeal
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon table salt1 ½    cups dairy milk, warmed2 large eggs¼    cup bacon grease or 
4 tablespoons (½    stick) 
unsalted butter
1 cup buttermilk, divided
½    cup Steen’s Cane Syrup 
(optional)
1. In a medium bowl, mix together the cornmeal, baking powder, 
and salt. Add the warmed milk to make a light batter consis-tency. Form a well in the middle of the batter, add the eggs, and beat until fully incorporated.
2. In a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, heat the bacon grease or butter over medium heat until very hot but not smoking. Pour in the batter, reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for about 5 minutes, until a crust has formed on the bottom. Remove the cover and stir well, scraping the bottom of the skillet and breaking up any large lumps of corn bread. Cover again and heat until cooked through but not fully dry, about 5 more min-utes. Stir again.
3. Serve in 4 individual cereal bowls with ¼    cup of buttermilk poured over each. Add cane syrup, if desired.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: Old-school couche couche recipes call for clabber or cur-
dled milk poured over the top. I’ve included buttermilk in this recipe for the final topping, but heavy cream, evaporated milk, or plain yogurt would work, too. If you want to make a quick clabbered milk, add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or white vinegar to 1 cup of milk and allow it to sit for 30 minutes at room temperature. Be sure to stir it well before serving.Complete Cajun Cookbook 28/G.ss09/a.ss09/r.ss09/l.ss09/i.ss09/c.ss09 /C.ss09/h.ss09/e.ss09/e.ss09/s.ss09/e.ss09 /G.ss09/r.ss09/i.ss09/t.ss09/s.ss09 /C.ss09/a.ss09/s.ss09/s.ss09/e.ss09/r.ss09/o.ss09/l.ss09/e.ss09
My mom, Martha Boudreaux, made this popular casserole for brunch or break-
fast on special occasions, and we always got excited when she announced it was on the menu. Grits, a Southern staple, are usually served as a creamy accompani-ment to eggs, used as a base for sautéed shrimp, or even turned into grits bread, grits soufflé, grits pudding, or baked grits.

2 large eggs, beaten
½    teaspoon kosher salt½    teaspoon freshly ground 
black pepper
1 cup cornflake crumbs
1. Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Grease a 9-by-9-inch casserole dish 
with 1 tablespoon of butter.
2. In a medium 2-quart or larger saucepan, melt 4 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add the garlic and sauté for 3 minutes, until softened. Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Stir in the grits, and reduce the heat to low. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until thick but pourable, 5 to 7 minutes for quick grits or 15 to 20 minutes for stone-ground grits.
3. Remove the grits from the heat and fold in the cheeses and eggs. Cut the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter into pieces, fold it into the grits, and season with the salt and pepper, stirring well. Transfer the grits to the casserole dish. Evenly sprinkle the top with the cornflake crumbs. Bake for 45 minutes, or until bubbling and slightly browned.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: If you have the time to use stone-ground grits, it’s worth it 
because they have a richer flavor and cook down to a thicker consistency.Breakfast 29/B.ss09/o.ss09/u.ss09/d.ss09/i.ss09/n.ss09

2 cups all-purpose flour, plus 
more for dusting
1 tablespoon baking powder2 teaspoons granulated sugar1 teaspoon baking soda½    teaspoon kosher salt2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 
cold, cut into small pieces, 
plus 2 tablespoons melted butter
1 cup buttermilk
½    cup chopped pig cracklings

2. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, sugar, baking soda, and salt. Cut the cold butter into the flour mix-ture until well blended. Add the buttermilk and pig cracklings or bacon (if using). Mix until the dough ball is firm and has absorbed the moisture, but do not overmix.
3. Turn the dough ball onto a floured surface and roll out to a 1-inch thickness. Using a 3-inch biscuit cutter or a short, round drinking glass, cut out the biscuits. Transfer to the coated baking sheet; then brush the biscuit tops with the melted butter. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. 
LAGNIAPPE TIP: You can cook these over a campfire, too. Prepare the 
dough in advance and keep well wrapped in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and refrigerated in the cooler. When ready for the campfire, allow the dough to stand at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Roll out the dough into a ½   -inch thickness; then cut into thin strips, about ½    inch wide and 4 inches long. Brush the dough pieces with butter, wrap them around green sticks, and hold over the fire until they are cooked through.Breakfast 31/C.ss09/r.ss09/e.ss09/o.ss09/l.ss09/e.ss09 /O.ss09/m.ss09/e.ss09/l.ss09/e.ss09/t.ss09
I first taught myself how to cook while watching Julia Child’s The French Chef
in /one.lin/nine.lin/seven.lin/four.lin. Julia inspired me to practice the omelet flip technique. About two dozen eggs later, I perfected it. A few even made it into the skillet. Serve this traditional cheese omelet with Creole sauce and you’ll see how this sauce can lend a South Louisiana flair to preparations not normally in the Cajun or Creole repertoire.

2. In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, melt ½    tablespoon of butter over medium-high heat. Add one-quarter of the egg mixture. Using a rubber spatula, turn up the edges of the omelet and tilt the pan to allow the uncooked egg mixture to flow under the cooked sections. Continue doing so until most of the egg is cooked on the bottom.
3. Using your wrist, jiggle the omelet to the edge of the pan opposite the handle; then quickly jerk the pan up and toward you to flip the omelet. Add 2 tablespoons of cheese to the middle of the omelet; then fold it onto a plate.

This decadence is worth every bit of the effort. Hard-boiled eggs are layered with 
two sauces: a Creole-style one and a rich, creamy béchamel. Then, as if that’s not enough, they are finished with a top layer of buttered cracker crumbs and cheese, all assembled in a casserole dish and baked in the oven.

Stir in the bay leaf, diced tomatoes, chili sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with the salt and cayenne pepper.Breakfast 33[ ]
2. MAKE THE BÉCHAMEL SAUCE:  In the meantime, in another 
medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter; then stir 
in the flour until well incorporated. Reduce the heat to low, and continue to stir as the mixture takes on a blond color. (This is called a blond roux.) Whisk in the milk until no lumps remain; then add the salt, white pepper, and nutmeg, and stir well. Con-tinue to simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened.
3. FINISH THE CASSEROLE:  Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Grease a 
9-by-9-inch or 2-quart casserole dish with cooking spray, and spoon alternating layers of Creole sauce, hard-boiled egg slices, and béchamel sauce until you have used all the eggs and both sauces. Evenly sprinkle the top with the cheddar cheese and then the cracker crumbs. Drizzle the melted butter over the top, and bake for 20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted, the cracker crumbs are browned, and the casserole is bubbling.Complete Cajun Cookbook 34/C.ss09/r.ss09/a.ss09/w.ss09/f.ss09/i.ss09/s.ss09/h.ss09 /E.ss09/g.ss09/g.ss09 /C.ss09/a.ss09/s.ss09/s.ss09/e.ss09/r.ss09/o.ss09/l.ss09/e.ss09
This breakfast casserole highlights the briny flavor of crawfish tails. You can buy 
them year-round in the Louisiana and Gulf coast regions, but this dish is also great with shrimp or crabmeat instead.

This dish is essentially a /one.lin-cup ramekin filled with baked layers of eggs, cream, 
bacon, cheese, and seasonings. It is so incredibly good while at the same time so incredibly versatile. I went on a three-month stretch where each Sunday morning I created a new shirred egg recipe, just based on what we had in the refrigerator at the time. See the Lagniappe Tip for some ideas.

Louisiana has an abundance of pecan trees, especially in the Acadiana region, 
perfect for sauces like this one. At least a dozen pecan trees thrived on the farm where my dad grew up. He told stories of collecting the pecan fruit before the squirrels got to them. Some years the harvest was really good and they used the pecans to barter with other families for food they were low on at the time.

FOR THE PECAN PRALINE SAUCE
½    cup water½    cup packed dark brown sugar1 cup white corn syrup1 cup chopped toasted pecans
1. MAKE THE WAFFLE BATTER:  In a medium bowl, sift the flour, 
sugar, baking powder, and salt.
2. In another medium bowl, beat the egg yolks (reserve the 
whites in a separate medium bowl) with the milk. Add the mix-ture to the dry ingredients, stirring well until no lumps remain. Add the melted butter and blend well to create a batter.
3. Using an electric mixer, beat the reserved egg whites for 4 to 5 minutes, until stiff peaks form.
4. Fold the toasted pecans (see Lagniappe Tip) into the waffle batter; then gently fold in the stiff egg whites.
5. Heat the waffle iron to manufacturer settings, coat with cook-ing spray, and pour enough batter to make a full-size waffle. Cook the waffle until no steam escapes and the batter is Breakfast 37[ ]
cooked through. Transfer the cooked waffle to a plate and keep 
warm; repeat with the remaining batter.
6. MAKE THE PRALINE PECAN SAUCE: In a small saucepan, bring 
the water and brown sugar to a boil over medium heat. Add the corn syrup, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the sauce comes back to a boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the pecans. Serve the warm pecan praline sauce over the pecan waffles.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: To toast pecans, heat a medium skillet over medium heat, 
and stir the chopped pecans until they start to brown on all sides. Keep an eye on them so they don’t burn. Once toasted to a darker brown color, transfer to a separate bowl to cool.39[]

Cajuns love to party, and this dip is a festive fête favorite. Before you add the 
crabmeat to the recipe, be sure to clean it, meaning pick out any shells. Atlantic blue crab is the main species caught in Louisiana. They’re commonly bought alive and then cooked at seafood boils (see page /one.lin/two.lin/one.lin).
PREP TIME:

2. In a medium saucepan, melt the remaining 7 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add the scallions and garlic and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes, until the scallions are soft and the garlic is aromatic. Stir in the flour to make a roux, reduce the heat to low, and continue to cook for a few minutes, allowing the flour to absorb the butter and liquid. Whisk in the wine until smooth, and then stir in the half-and-half.
3. Bring the sauce to a simmer and allow it to thicken a bit, about 5 minutes. Fold in the shredded cheese and stir in the Worcestershire sauce, parsley, hot sauce, salt, dry mustard, and cayenne pepper. Simmer for 5 more minutes; then gently fold in the crabmeat.

When the party gets fancy, Cajun people break out the crab claws. This dish is 
a no-cook crowd-pleaser. Blue crab claws are already cooked and cleaned from boiled or steamed crabs and are sold in /one.lin-pound containers. Some believe the dark claw meat has even more flavor than the popular jumbo lump meat.
PREP TIME:
10 MINUTES, PLUS 12 HOURS TO MARINATE
SERVES 4 TO 61 pound blue crab claws
1 cup chopped celery½    cup extra-virgin olive oil¼    cup red wine vinegar¼    cup white wine, preferably 
chardonnay
¼    cup chopped scallions, green

1 tablespoon Cajun Seasoning 
(page 19)
4 garlic cloves, minced1 ½    teaspoons granulated sugar1 teaspoon hot sauce½    teaspoon kosher salt
1. Clean the crab claws by removing any loose shells, place in a 
medium bowl, and keep refrigerated.
2. In the bowl of a food processor or blender, combine the celery, olive oil, vinegar, wine, scallions, Parmesan, lemon juice, parsley, bell pepper, Worcestershire sauce, Cajun seasoning, garlic, sugar, hot sauce, and salt, and blend until the dressing is emulsified. Pour the dressing over the crab claws, cover, and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or overnight.
3. To serve, transfer the crab claws to a serving platter lined with lettuce or kale, and spoon a bit of the marinade over the top to keep them moist.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: If you’d like to serve these warm, when ready, transfer the 
claws and marinade to a medium saucepan, and heat over medium-low heat for 5 to 10 minutes, until warmed through and just bubbling.

A Cajun country favorite during summer harvest and preserving season, these 
pickles are a crunchy delight anytime. Pickling okra will preserve the bounty beyond the growing season. This treat is crunchy and tart and great served with salads or accompanying Red Beans and Rice (page /eight.lin/eight.lin).
PREP TIME:
15 MINUTES
COOK TIME:
20 MINUTES
MAKES 
4 PINT/uni00A0JARS3 cups white wine vinegar (at 
least 5% acidity)
3 cups water
3 tablespoons pickling salt1 teaspoon celery seed1 teaspoon mustard seed12 garlic cloves4 small red cayenne peppers, 
halved
4 pounds small whole okra 
pods, trimmed (see 
Lagniappe Tip)
1. Prepare the canner by filling a 12-quart stockpot with water 
about three-quarters of the way up and heat over high. Wash, rinse, and air-dry 4 pint-size jar-and-lid sets. Place the lid sets into a small saucepan and cover them with warm water set on very low heat to keep them sterile.
2. In a large nonreactive saucepan, combine the vinegar, water, pickling salt, celery seed, and mustard seed. Bring to a boil over medium heat and stir well to dissolve the salt. Reduce the heat to low, keeping the pickling liquid warm.
3. Place 3 whole garlic cloves and 2 red cayenne pepper halves in each jar. Pack the trimmed okra pods in the jars, leaving ½    inch of headspace at the top. Ladle the pickling liquid into the jars, leaving ½    inch of headspace. Remove any air bubbles using a chopstick or air-bubble remover tool, and adjust the pickling liquid if it has dropped. Wipe the rims of the jars; then center the sterile lids, and twist on the screw band until you meet slight resistance, known as a finger-tight seal.Appetizers 43[ ]
4. Place the jars on a rack in the canner, ensure they are covered 
with at least 1 inch of water, and cover the canner pot with a lid. Bring the water to a boil, and process for 15 minutes. (Start your timer when the water comes to a boil.)
5. Turn off the heat, remove the canner pot lid, and allow the jars to sit for 5 minutes. Remove the jars with tongs or a jar-remover tool, and place them on a towel-lined counter-top. Allow the jars to cool completely to room temperature. You know the jars are canned properly when the lids pop or become concave within 5 to 10 minutes of setting them on the counter, which indicates an airtight seal. If the jars do not have the concave lid, process them again in the water bath.
LAGNIAPPE TIP:  Trim okra by cutting off the stems without cutting through 
the pod. Pickled okra is best after about 2 months of storage, but that never 
stopped us from opening up a jar the day after canning. Store in a cool, dry, dark location for up to a year.Complete Cajun Cookbook 44/S.ss09/h.ss09/r.ss09/i.ss09/m.ss09/p.ss09 /R.ss09/e.ss09/m.ss09/o.ss09/u.ss09/l.ss09/a.ss09/d.ss09/e.ss09
Originally from France, this mayonnaise-based sauce gets a South Louisi-
ana kick with the horseradish, hot sauce, and cayenne pepper. The Louisiana versions vary from dark red Creole adaptations to light white in appearance. Remoulade sauce is also great with fried green tomatoes or boiled crawfish tails or as a dip for boiled artichoke leaves.

2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon kosher salt½    teaspoon freshly ground 
black pepper¼    teaspoon cayenne pepper1 cup dairy milk1 large egg, beaten1 teaspoon Worcestershire 
sauce
1 quart peanut oil
1. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the shrimp and 
scallions, and pulse until ground together. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl, and add the flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, milk, beaten egg, and Worcestershire sauce, stirring well to form a batter.
2. In a deep saucepan or deep fryer, heat the peanut oil to 375˚F. Working in batches, drop the batter by the tablespoonful into the oil, and fry for about 5 minutes, until browned and floating on the top of the oil. Check the oil temperature periodically and adjust as needed. Using a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer each batch to a paper towel–lined plate to drain.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: Don’t overcrowd. Adding too much food to the fryer 
at once will lower the heat of the oil below the desired fry temperature. The food will take too long to cook, and it will be greasy and soggy from absorbing too much oil.Complete Cajun Cookbook 48/C.ss09/r.ss09/a.ss09/w.ss09/f.ss09/i.ss09/s.ss09/h.ss09 /C.ss09/a.ss09/k.ss09/e.ss09/s.ss09
Cajuns formed a bond with the lowly crawfish upon their arrival in Louisiana in 
the /one.lin/seven.lin/six.lin/zero.lins. It became their dominant seafood and food-related ethnic symbol. This appetizer is just one of numerous recipes inspired by the crawfish. These cakes also make great sandwich patties if served on a bun. If you like your craw-fish cakes slider-size, form them into /three.lin/two.lin smaller portions and brown them the same way.

For eggplant fans or your vegetarian partygoers, this Creole take on eggplant 
will bring down the house. This recipe boasts bountiful layers of marinated fried eggplant slices, Creole-style tomato sauce, and cheese. It also uses an old-school method of making a roux with tomato sauce and the Cajun Trinity, along with a bit of cabernet wine cooked down in the sauce.
PREP TIME:
20 MINUTES, PLUS 2 HOURS TO MARINATE
COOK TIME:
1 HOUR
SERVES 84 tablespoons (½    stick) 
unsalted butter, divided
4 cups water
1 tablespoon salt plus 
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 medium eggplant, peeled and 
cut into ¼   -inch-thick rounds
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour1 cup canned or jarred tomato 
sauce
1 cup chopped yellow onion1 cup chopped celery1 cup chopped green bell 
pepper
8 garlic cloves, minced1 ½    cups red wine, preferably 
cabernet
1 tablespoon Worcestershire 
sauce
1 teaspoon hot sauce¼    teaspoon cayenne pepper4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive 
oil, divided
2 cups grated Romano cheese
1. Grease a 9-by-13-inch casserole dish with 1 tablespoon 
of butter.
2. In a large bowl, combine the water and 1 tablespoon of salt, and stir to dissolve the salt. Place the eggplant in the salted water, and marinate for about 2 hours. Rinse the eggplant slices in cool water, and place them in a colander over the sink to fully drain.Appetizers 51[ ]
3. In a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons 
of butter over medium heat; then add the flour. Stir for a few minutes to make a roux. Add the tomato sauce, stirring well until no lumps remain. Add the Trinity of onion, celery, and bell pepper and the garlic, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for about 10 minutes. Add the wine, Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon of salt, hot sauce, and cayenne pepper, and continue to simmer for about 20 minutes.
4. While the sauce is simmering, in a separate heavy cast-iron skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil for each batch, and fry the eggplant slices in four batches until browned on each side, about 6 minutes per batch. Transfer the fried eggplant slices to the casserole dish.
5. After you’ve placed the first layer of eggplant in the casserole dish, spoon enough sauce to evenly cover the slices, about ¾    cup; then sprinkle Romano cheese evenly over the sauce, also about ¾    cup.

Many Cajun gardeners can be found tending their overflowing plots of fresh 
vegetables. You’ll often find Creole tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, squash, and cucumber vines adorning a trellis or fence. This delightfully cooling dip, fea-turing cream cheese, sour cream, cucumbers, and chives, makes for a pleasant break from gardening on a warm summer day in bayou country. Serve it with toast triangles, crackers, or pita chips for dipping.

Found year-round in grocery seafood sections, store-bought catfish is 
farm-raised in Louisiana and Mississippi. This popular fish can actually be caught year-round as well; spring is the best time to fish for the big blue catfish in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers. These fresh bite-size catfish fillet pieces make a delicious warm finger food that can be served alone or with ketchup or tartar sauce for dipping.

for sprinkling (optional)
1. In a medium bowl, mix the hot sauce, mustard, salt, and 
pepper. Coat the catfish pieces in the mixture, cover, and refrig-erate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.
2. When ready to fry, add the beaten eggs to the catfish mixture, and stir well. In a separate medium bowl, combine the corn-meal and baking soda.
3. In a deep saucepan or deep fryer, heat the peanut oil to 375˚F. Dredge the catfish pieces in the cornmeal mixture, shaking off the excess. Working in batches so you don’t crowd the fryer, fry the pieces for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they float to the top and are golden brown. Check the oil temperature periodically, and adjust as needed. Using a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer the fish to a paper towel–lined plate. Sprinkle with Cajun Seasoning (if using) and serve immediately.Complete Cajun Cookbook 54/C.ss09/r.ss09/a.ss09/w.ss09/f.ss09/i.ss09/s.ss09/h.ss09 /C.ss09/a.ss09/r.ss09/d.ss09/i.ss09/n.ss09/a.ss09/l.ss09
This recipe was once a special-occasion dish at local restaurants until it fell out 
of fashion. Luckily, home cooks have kept the tradition alive. The recipe features crawfish tails in a tomato-brandy cream sauce, baked and served in ramekins. This dish earned its name for its colorful resemblance to the bird.
PREP TIME:
10 MINUTES
COOK TIME:
30 MINUTES
SERVES 84 tablespoons (½    stick) 
unsalted butter, divided
1 cup chopped scallions, green 
and white parts
6 garlic cloves, minced
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour½    cup brandy3 tablespoons tomato paste1 ½    cups heavy cream½    tablespoon Worcestershire 
sauce
2 teaspoons lemon juice1 teaspoon hot sauce1 teaspoon kosher salt½    teaspoon white pepper1 (1-pound) bag cooked 
crawfish tails, fresh or frozen
Paprika, for dusting
1. Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Grease 8 (¾   -cup) ramekins with 
1 tablespoon of butter. In a large saucepan, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add the scallions and sauté, stirring continuously, for 2 minutes. Add the garlic, and continue to cook for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to low, stir in the flour, and cook for several minutes, until the butter is absorbed into the flour and forms a paste-like roux.
2. Add the brandy, stir to remove any lumps, and then stir in the tomato paste until fully incorporated. Whisk in the heavy cream, ensuring the tomato roux is smoothed out and no lumps remain. Whisk in the Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, hot sauce, salt, and white pepper. Increase the heat to medium, bring the sauce to a simmer, and cook for several minutes, until thickened. Fold in the crawfish tails, and bring back to a simmer. Remove from the heat.
3. Divide the mixture evenly among the ramekins. Sprinkle each with paprika, and bake for 15 minutes, or until bubbling on the sides.Appetizers 55/H.ss09/o.ss09/t.ss09 /M.ss09/i.ss09/r.ss09/l.ss09/i.ss09/t.ss09/o.ss09/n.ss09 /a.ss09/n.ss09/d.ss09 /S.ss09/e.ss09/a.ss09/f.ss09/o.ss09/o.ss09/d.ss09 /D.ss09/i.ss09/p.ss09

Escargot is the French word for snail, which has been eaten in France for thou-
sands of years. Cajuns have continued the escargot dining tradition in Louisiana. In this recipe, you cook them in a savory garlic herb butter, stuff them into mushroom caps, and broil. Canned snails are used here because they are readily available and easier to prepare.

These flavorful titbits always delight a crowd. This recipe evolved from the 
Italian-American influences in Louisiana. They were a huge finger-food hit from the /one.lin/nine.lin/five.lin/zero.lins to the /one.lin/nine.lin/nine.lin/zero.lins but went out of vogue. Now they are making their right-ful comeback on the Cajun party food scene.

This traditional greens-only gumbo is often made from up to /one.lin/one.lin different leafy 
vegetables. The meatless version of this recipe originated as a Lenten dish, to be served during the season when practicing Catholics abstain from eating meat for /four.lin/zero.lin days. My version uses fewer greens and is not Lent-friendly because it adds pickled pork and ham hocks. Pickled pork is sold in the meat department of local Louisiana groceries, but ham works in a pinch.

SERVES 83 ½    pounds greens (choose at 
least 5 of the following: beet 
tops, carrot tops, chicory, collard, kale, mustard, parsley, spinach, Swiss chard, turnip, and watercress)
1 large head green cabbage,

1. Remove the stems, hard centers, and any discolored leaves 
from the greens. In batches, rinse the greens and cabbage in a large colander with cool water to remove any sand or dirt, and drain them well.
2. In a 12-quart or larger stockpot, combine the greens and the cabbage with the chicken stock. Bring to a boil over high heat; then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 45 minutes, or until the greens are tender. Place a colander over a large heatproof bowl and drain the cooked greens, reserving the liquid. Once the greens are cool, chop into ½   -inch pieces and set aside.Soups AND Stews 61[ ]
3. In the stockpot, melt the bacon grease or butter over

Gumbo may be to Louisiana what chili is to Texas: the most well-known, quint-
essential Cajun dish. There are about as many variations of seafood gumbo as there are people who make it, but this traditional version—made with shrimp, oysters, and blue crabmeat, thickened with a roux, and served over cooked white rice—is sure to please any gumbo aficionado.

¼    cup chopped fresh parsleyKosher saltCayenne pepperCooked white rice
1. In a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, melt 7 tablespoons of butter over 
medium heat. Once the butter is hot, whisk in the flour to make a roux. Once the flour is fully absorbed into the butter, reduce the heat to low and stir constantly with a wooden spoon for 15 to 20 minutes, until a dark roux forms. The roux is done when the color resembles a dark brown brick and the aroma is that of toasted nuts. Set aside.
2. In a 6-quart stockpot, melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add the yellow onion, celery, and bell pepper, and sauté for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent. Add the garlic, thyme, and oregano, and continue cooking for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Soups AND Stews 63[ ]
Whisk in the seafood stock and reserved oyster liquor; then stir 
in the roux until it is smooth and no lumps remain.
3. Increase the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Add the gumbo crabs (if using), Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and bay leaves. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
4. Add the shrimp, crabmeat, oysters, scallions, and parsley, and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the shrimp are pink and the oysters are curled on the edges. Season to taste with salt and cayenne pepper. Serve over cooked white rice.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: Gumbo crabs are sold frozen in packages of 6 or 8; they 
are too small to eat alone but just the right size to break in half and add to gumbo. They add a wonderful foundation of flavor to a seafood gumbo and are great served on top of each bowl as a garnish.Complete Cajun Cookbook 64/C.ss09/h.ss09/i.ss09/c.ss09/k.ss09/e.ss09/n.ss09 /a.ss09/n.ss09/d.ss09 /S.ss09/a.ss09/u.ss09/s.ss09/a.ss09/g.ss09/e.ss09 /G.ss09/u.ss09/m.ss09/b.ss09/o.ss09
I probably prepare this gumbo more often than any other because the combi-
nation of chicken, smoked sausage, the Cajun Trinity, roux, and filé makes an outstanding soup. Served over cooked white rice, this staple is found at wed-dings, Mardi Gras events, and holiday celebrations. This recipe has both okra and filé powder in it, and although gumbo purists will tell you that a gumbo never has both, I love the added flavor the combination brings to the recipe.

1. In a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, melt 7 tablespoons of butter over 
medium heat. Once the butter is hot, whisk in the flour to make a roux. When the flour is fully absorbed into the butter, reduce the heat to low and stir constantly with a wooden spoon for 15 to 20 minutes, until a dark roux forms. The roux is ready when it reaches a dark brown brick color and the aroma is simi-lar to toasted nuts. Set aside.
2. In a 6-quart stockpot, melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add the sliced smoked sausage and cook for about 5 minutes, until browned evenly on all sides. Soups AND Stews 65[ ]
Add the Trinity of onion, celery, and bell pepper. Sauté, stirring 
frequently, for about 5 minutes, until the vegetables are wilted and translucent. Add the garlic and stir for 1 minute.
3. Add the chicken stock, tomato paste, diced tomatoes, okra, thyme, basil, oregano, bay leaf, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce. Stir until the roux is smooth and no lumps remain. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil, stirring occasion-ally. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour.
4. Fold in the chicken, and simmer for about 15 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.
5. In a small bowl, make a slurry with the filé powder by combin-ing it with ¼    cup of cool water. Whisk well with a fork until no lumps remain; then pour the slurry into the gumbo. (This step prevents the filé powder from clumping in the hot gumbo.) Add the scallions, as well as salt and white pepper to taste. Serve over cooked white rice.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: Filé powder is made from ground sassafras tree leaves 
and smells and tastes like a mixture of mild thyme, savory, and hints of root beer or licorice. It’s mainly added as a thickener in gumbo.Complete Cajun Cookbook 66/D.ss09/u.ss09/c.ss09/k.ss09 /a.ss09/n.ss09/d.ss09 /A.ss09/n.ss09/d.ss09/o.ss09/u.ss09/i.ss09/l.ss09/l.ss09/e.ss09 /G.ss09/u.ss09/m.ss09/b.ss09/o.ss09
Cajun hunters and trappers always had a good supply of ducks, so it’s no sur-
prise that duck gumbo is the most popular game soup in bayou country. Roasted whole duck is cooked, skinned, deboned, and then added to a roux-based gumbo with andouille sausage and the classic Cajun Trinity so you can dig into an authentic taste of South Louisiana.

8 garlic cloves, minced6 cups chicken stock1 bay leaf1 tablespoon Worcestershire 
sauce
1 tablespoon hot sauce1 bunch scallions, green parts 
only, chopped
Cooked white rice
1. Preheat the oven to 375˚F. Rinse and pat dry the whole duck; 
then season with the salt and black pepper. Place the duck in a roasting pan, and roast for 1 hour.
2. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter and use it to baste the duck. Continue to roast the duck for 45 more minutes, basting every 15 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow it to cool for about 45 minutes. Pull off the skin and remove the meat from the bones. Cut the meat into 1-inch cubes and set aside.
3. While the duck is roasting and cooling, in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, melt 7 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat; then whisk in the flour. Switch to a wooden spoon, and reduce the heat to low. Cook, stirring constantly, for 15 to 20 minutes, until the roux is a dark brown brick color with an aroma similar to toasted nuts. Set aside.Soups AND Stews 67[ ]
4. In a 6-quart stockpot, melt the remaining 1 tablespoon of 
butter over medium heat. Add the andouille sausage, and stir well to brown on all sides. Add the Trinity of onion, celery, and bell pepper. Sauté, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes, until the vegetables are wilted and translucent. Add the garlic and stir for 1 minute. Stir in the roux until incorporated.
5. To the 6-quart stockpot, add the chicken stock and whisk until the roux has dissolved and no lumps remain. Add the bay leaf, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for about 1 hour. Add the cooked duck meat and scallions, season to taste with salt and black pepper, and continue to simmer for about 5 minutes. Serve over cooked white rice.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: The roasted duck will leave you with some rendered duck 
fat, which is a great cooking fat you can use in place of bacon fat. To save the fat, allow it to cool, but pour it through a funnel into a glass jar while it is still in liquid form. Seal and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 months.Complete Cajun Cookbook 68/O.ss09/k.ss09/r.ss09/a.ss09 /G.ss09/u.ss09/m.ss09/b.ss09/o.ss09
There are three traditional ways to thicken gumbo: roux, filé powder, and okra. 
So far in this chapter, we have used the first two; this recipe uses okra. Okra is one of the most popular vegetables grown in family gardens in South Louisiana during the hot summer months. This gumbo is thickened only with okra because its flavor blends beautifully with the flavors of tomatoes, shrimp, and, of course, the Trinity.

This tomato-based seafood broth was likely a historical precursor to gumbo. The 
Cajuns adapted this traditional French cuisine preparation to bring out the local flavors of the seafood available in the swamps and bayous of South Louisiana. The classic version is cooked with whole fish, live crawfish, and live crabs, and then the seafood is removed and cleaned, but my version eliminates the messy deboning and shelling process.

This roux-thickened, chicken stock–based soup consists of a handful of vege-
tables from the genus Allium, which includes yellow onions, red onions, leeks, shallots, garlic, scallions, and chives. Interestingly, these alliums are part of the lily family, earning them the nickname “stinking lilies.” Although there are seven onion family ingredients, we always stick with the traditional “six onion” moniker.

Creole tomatoes are grown in the alluvial plains near the Mississippi River, just 
south of New Orleans in St. Bernard Parish and Plaquemines Parish. The soil gives the tomatoes their distinctive sunny-sweet, slightly acidic, and earthy flavor, which makes this a uniquely Louisiana soup. If you cannot get Creoles in your area, an heirloom beefsteak tomato variety will work.

Red beans and rice was a dish traditionally made on Mondays. This soup 
became a common Tuesday night meal using Monday’s leftover kidney beans. Red kidney beans; the Cajun Trinity of onion, celery, and bell pepper; ham hock; and smoked sausage in a beef stock laced with sherry all combine to make this dish, which is popular on cold winter days. Mashing some of the beans gives this a lovely creamy texture.

Rabbit is a popular protein in Cajun cuisine, with dishes such as rabbit gumbo, 
smothered rabbit, rabbit sauce piquant, and rabbit in Creole sauce. Rabbit sold in stores is typically cut into the separate leg quarters and loin sections, but if you need to cut your own, it’s quite similar to cutting up a chicken: just follow the major joints.
PREP TIME:
15 MINUTES, PLUS OVER-NIGHT TO MARINATE
COOK TIME:
1 HOUR
SERVES 61 (3-pound) rabbit, cut into 
6 pieces (2 loins, 2 forelegs, 
2 hind legs)
3 cups white wine, preferably 
chardonnay, divided
½    cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh 
thyme
1 tablespoon chopped fresh 
rosemary
1 tablespoon chopped fresh 
chives
1 tablespoon chopped fresh 
oregano
1 teaspoon kosher salt1 teaspoon freshly ground black 
pepper8 garlic cloves, minced4 tablespoons bacon grease or 
½    stick unsalted butter
¼    cup all-purpose flour2 cups chopped yellow onion1 cup chopped green bell 
pepper
1 pound (2 ½    cups) fresh sliced 
mushrooms
2 cups chicken stock1 tablespoon Worcestershire 
sauce
½    cup chopped scallions, green 
parts only
¼    cup chopped fresh parsleyCooked white rice
1. Put the rabbit pieces in a large nonreactive bowl. In a separate 
medium bowl, make the marinade by combining 2 cups of wine, the olive oil, thyme, rosemary, chives, oregano, salt, black pepper, and garlic; stir well. Pour the marinade over the rabbit pieces and turn to coat each piece well. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.
2. In a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, melt the bacon grease or butter over medium heat. Remove the rabbit from the marinade, allowing any excess to drip off. Add the rabbit pieces to the skillet and cook for about 4 minutes per side, until browned evenly. Transfer to a sheet pan and set aside.Soups AND Stews 75[ ]
3. Reduce the heat to low. Add the flour to the same skillet, and 
stir well to make a roux. Continue to cook the roux, stirring frequently, for 5 to 10 minutes, until dark brown. Add the onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms, and stir for about 5 minutes.
4. Add the remaining 1 cup of wine to deglaze the pan, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any browned bits. Add the chicken stock and Worcestershire sauce. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil.
5. Reduce the heat to low. Add the rabbit pieces and cook, uncov-ered, for 15 minutes. Flip the pieces and cook for about 15 more minutes, until tender.
6. Sprinkle the scallions and parsley evenly over the top of the rabbit, and serve the stew immediately over cooked white rice.
SUBSTITUTION TIP:  There really is no substitute for rabbit, but the closest 
thing would be chicken thighs. Prepare 3 pounds of chicken thighs the same 
way you would the rabbit.Complete Cajun Cookbook 76/O.ss09/y.ss09/s.ss09/t.ss09/e.ss09/r.ss09 /S.ss09/t.ss09/e.ss09/w.ss09
At the peak of oyster season, typically September through March, oysters have 
a higher salt content, which makes this recipe even more flavorful. But this milk-based creamy soup is thickened with a roux and seasoned with onions, garlic, and parsley, so it’s an absolute treat any time of year. Don’t forget some crusty French bread on the side.

The marriage of sweet corn and lump crabmeat is a sensation in this creamy 
comfort soup. Corn is a plentiful crop in the Acadian prairies, and crabs are found along nearby bayous, low-lying swamps, and marshlands, so it’s not hard to figure out how this soup came to be a Cajun mash-up.

2. Add the seafood stock and stir until the roux is smooth and no lumps remain. Bring it to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and continue to simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Add the heavy cream, scallions, and parsley, season to taste with salt and white pepper, stir well, and continue to simmer for about 5 minutes. Gently fold in the crabmeat, heat through for about 5 minutes, and serve in large soup bowls.
SUBSTITUTION TIP:  If lump crabmeat is unavailable, you can substitute 
small (70 to 90 count) shrimp. Add the shrimp just after the addition of the 
cream and simmer for about 5 minutes, until pink.Soups AND Stews 79/P.ss09/o.ss09/t.ss09-/a.ss09/u.ss09-/F.ss09/e.ss09/u.ss09
Literally translated from French as “pot on the fire,” this recipe is another French 
staple taken on by Cajuns who added their own flair and made variations using small game like dove and quail. As a blank canvas, this recipe can use any kind of meat that might be on hand; its versatility made it a favorite among Cajuns who weren’t always sure what kind of meat they would have available.

Tasso, highly seasoned and cured pork shoulder, lends flavor to many dishes and 
is a must-have Cajun delicacy. Several recipes in this book include tasso, such as Corn Maque Choux (page /one.lin/five.lin/five.lin), Pecan Rice Dressing (page/uni00A0/eight.lin/nine.lin), and Chicken and Andouille Jambalaya (page /nine.lin/zero.lin). Or you can slice it thinly and serve with crackers as a snack.

MAKES 
2 POUNDS½    cup Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon hot sauce2 ½    pounds boneless pork 
shoulder roast, cut into 
½   -inch-thick pieces
2 tablespoons smoked paprika2 tablespoons garlic powder
2 tablespoons onion powder2 tablespoons kosher salt1 tablespoon cayenne pepper1 tablespoon freshly ground 
black pepper
1. In a medium nonreactive bowl, combine the Worcestershire 
sauce and hot sauce, add the pork shoulder butt roast pieces, and coat them evenly with the mixture. In a small bowl, com-bine the smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, cayenne pepper, and black pepper. Mix the spices well; then add them to the coated pork pieces. Make sure all the pieces are well coated with the spices.
2. Transfer the seasoned pork strips, spices, and any remaining liquid to a one-gallon zip-top bag, remove as much air as possi-ble, seal, and refrigerate at least overnight or up to 3 days.
3. Prepare a meat smoker with wood chips; pecan wood is prefer-able because of its rich, buttery, nutty flavor. Set the marinated pork strips on the smoker rack(s). Cool smoke at 190˚F for 2½    to 3 hours, or until the internal temperature is 170˚F.
4. Tasso can be packed in zip-top bags and refrigerated for up to 7 days or frozen for several months.
SUBSTITUTION TIP:  If you don’t have a smoker, you can still make tasso; 
it just won’t have part of its distinctive flavor. Place it in a 190˚F oven, and 
follow the recipe steps.Meat and Poultry 85/B.ss09/r.ss09/a.ss09/i.ss09/s.ss09/e.ss09/d.ss09 /P.ss09/o.ss09/r.ss09/k.ss09 /C.ss09/h.ss09/o.ss09/p.ss09/s.ss09
One of the products to come out of the boucherie tradition is a supply of 
thick-cut pork chops. Brining them seals in the juices, while the cane syrup–apple vinegar glaze creates a tangy sweet-and-sour flavor.
PREP TIME:

any maple syrup)
1 cup apple cider vinegar
1. In a large nonreactive bowl, combine 2 bottles of beer with 
the orange juice, sugar, salt, peppercorns, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, juniper berries, and cloves. Stir to dissolve the salt and sugar. Transfer the brine to a plastic container. Add the chops, ensuring the brine covers them. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.
2. Remove the pork chops from the marinade and pat dry. In a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the pork chops and cook for about 4 minutes per side, until browned. Add the onion, and continue to cook until soft and browned. Add the remaining 1 bottle of beer and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 hour.
3. In the meantime, in a small saucepan, combine the cane syrup and vinegar, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 15 minutes, until the liquid has been reduced to 1 cup.
4. When the pork chops are tender, remove them from the skillet along with the onion. To serve, spoon ¼    cup of glaze over each pork chop.Complete Cajun Cookbook 86/G.ss09/r.ss09/i.ss09/l.ss09/l.ss09/a.ss09/d.ss09/e.ss09/s.ss09
This grillades (pronounced “GREE-ahds”) recipe is an old-school one—and 
a family favorite. The inspiration comes from my aunt Carolyn through her daughter Christine. Traditionally, grillades are made with beef (or sometimes veal or pork) and served for either breakfast or brunch over grits or for dinner with cooked rice. Despite the name, grillades are not grilled but rather browned, braised, and gravy-smothered.
PREP TIME:
30 MINUTES
COOK TIME:
2 HOURS
SERVES 62 ½    pounds beef top round, cut 
into 2-inch cubes
½    teaspoon kosher salt, plus 
more to taste
½    teaspoon freshly ground 
black pepper, plus more to 
taste
¼    cup all-purpose flour
¼    cup vegetable oil or bacon 
grease
2 cups chopped yellow onion1 cup chopped celery1 cup chopped green bell 
pepper
8 garlic cloves, minced½    teaspoon dried thyme½    teaspoon dried basil½    teaspoon dried oregano¼    teaspoon cayenne pepper½    cup red wine, preferably 
cabernet or merlot
2 cups beef stock1 ½    cups diced tomatoesGrits or cooked white rice
1. In a large nonreactive bowl, season the beef cubes with the salt 
and black pepper; then toss with the flour, ensuring each piece is evenly coated.
2. In a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Once it’s hot, working in two batches, gently add the floured beef cubes. Cook, turning occasionally, for 8 to 10 minutes, until browned on all sides. Set aside the first batch while working on the second. After the second batch is complete, return the first batch to the skillet so all the beef is in the skillet.Meat and Poultry 87[ ]
3. Add the Trinity of onion, celery, and bell pepper. Sauté, stir-
ring frequently and scraping the bottom of the pan, for about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and stir for 1 minute. Add the thyme, basil, oregano, and cayenne pepper, and stir. Deglaze the pan with the wine for about 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any browned bits.
4. Add the beef stock and diced tomatoes, stir, reduce the heat to medium-high, and bring the liquid to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and continue to simmer for 1½    hours, or until the beef is tender and the liquid has thickened. Stir every 20 to 30 minutes to prevent scorching or burning. Season to taste with salt and black pepper, and serve over grits or cooked white rice.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: Some grillades recipes call for beef and others for veal. 
Although traditional Cajuns were thrifty and cooked with budget-friendlier beef, the upper crust who could afford it made theirs with veal. If cooking with veal, the final simmer time can be cut in half to 45 minutes.Complete Cajun Cookbook 88/R.ss09/e.ss09/d.ss09 /B.ss09/e.ss09/a.ss09/n.ss09/s.ss09 /a.ss09/n.ss09/d.ss09 /R.ss09/i.ss09/c.ss09/e.ss09
This traditional Louisiana one-pot meal feeds a crowd. It’s great served over 
white rice with a side of Corn Bread (page /one.lin/five.lin/four.lin), but it also goes well with a side of smothered greens. My dad, Joseph Boudreaux, liked to drizzle spiced pepper vinegar on top of his red beans, and my father in-law, Clayton Boyer, put mayon-naise on top of his. To each family its own.

Pecan trees are plentiful in South Louisiana. The old Boudreaux farm had about 
/one.lin/two.lin trees that provided the family with plenty to harvest, shell, eat, and barter—hence the many variations on pecan recipes. This dressing is similar to basic rice dressing, but it has the added bonuses of chopped pecans, ground pork, tasso, and oysters, making it particularly holiday-worthy.

Louisiana is practically synonymous with jambalaya. It has been proclaimed 
the jambalaya capital of the world and even hosts an annual jambalaya festival. The traditional version uses chicken and sausage; this amazing variation uses flavorful andouille sausage and spicy tasso. You’d be proud to enter this dish in any jambalaya competition.

3. Stir in the rice and chicken, and cover the pot. Cook in the oven for 15 minutes.
4. Remove from the oven, lift the cover, and stir, making sure the rice, sausage, tasso, and chicken are evenly distributed. Cover the pot, return it to the oven, and cook for 15 more minutes. Remove from the oven, lift the cover, and stir well to determine if the rice is fully cooked and most of the liquid is absorbed. If the rice needs more cooking, cover the pot and cook for 5 to 10 more minutes.
5. When ready to serve, pull the pot from the oven and let the pot stand, covered, for 10 more minutes. Stir in the scallions and parsley, and serve immediately.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: Just like gumbo, there are as many variations of jam-
balaya as folks who make it. Some jambalaya recipes are made with only smoked sausage, and others combine sausage and seafood like shrimp and oysters or use sausage and ham. Rabbit, game birds, and squirrel all feature in varieties of Cajun hunter camp jambalaya.Complete Cajun Cookbook 92/C.ss09/a.ss09/j.ss09/u.ss09/n.ss09 /D.ss09/i.ss09/r.ss09/t.ss09/y.ss09 /R.ss09/i.ss09/c.ss09/e.ss09
Dirty rice is a Cajun rice dish that gets “dirty” from the addition of chicken giz-
zards and liver. Great as a side dish for fried or grilled foods, it’s also perfect as a stand-alone meal. You can even add game meat, seafood, or more chicken. If you prefer to omit the gizzards, you can double the amount of chicken liver.

Duck and figs go well together and are plentiful in Cajun country. The Bou-
dreaux farm had several fig trees, my great-grandparents had a huge fig tree I used to climb, we had two fig trees in our New Orleans backyard, and I have one in my yard right now. As for the ducks, hunting season in Louisiana runs through most of the winter months between November and February, so duck is plentiful all winter long. And never fear: Domestic farm-raised duck is sold year-round in most grocery stores.

SERVES 4FOR THE DUCK AND DUCK RUB
1 (5-pound) domestic or wild 
duck
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon smoked paprika1 teaspoon garlic powder1 teaspoon onion powder½    teaspoon cayenne pepperFOR THE BRANDY FIG GLAZE
1 cup fig preserves½    cup brandy¼    cup Steen’s Cane Syrup (or 
any maple syrup)
2 tablespoons lemon juice½    teaspoon kosher salt¼    teaspoon ground ginger¼    teaspoon ground cloves¼    teaspoon freshly ground

1. MAKE THE DUCK AND RUB:  Preheat the oven to 450˚F. Rinse 
and pat dry the duck; then place it in a large container.
2. In a small bowl, combine the salt, smoked paprika, garlic 
powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper. Use this rub to season the inside and outside of the duck.
3. Put the spiced duck on a wire rack inside a roasting pan. Roast for 1 hour. While it is roasting, make the glaze.Meat and Poultry 95[ ]
4. MAKE THE BRANDY FIG GLAZE:  In the bowl of a blender, com-
bine the fig preserves, brandy, cane syrup, lemon juice, salt, 
ginger, cloves, and black pepper. Blend until puréed. Transfer the glaze to a small saucepan. Simmer over low heat, stirring constantly, for 10 to 15 minutes, until thickened. Remove from the heat and set aside.
5. After the first hour, remove the duck, and reduce the oven temperature to 350˚F. Spoon the brandy fig glaze over the entire duck. Return the duck to the oven and roast for 1 more hour, or until the internal temperature of the breast meat is 175˚F, the meat is fork tender, and the drumsticks are easy to move around.
6. Let the duck rest for 15 minutes out of the oven; then slice into 4 quarter pieces, 2 breast-wing portions, and 2 leg-thigh portions and serve.

find readily available in grocery stores today. Traditional Cajun duck recipes vary depending on the type of wild duck hunted.Complete Cajun Cookbook 96/R.ss09/a.ss09/b.ss09/b.ss09/i.ss09/t.ss09 /a.ss09/u.ss09 /P.ss09/o.ss09/i.ss09/v.ss09/r.ss09/e.ss09
This recipe has been my go-to rabbit preparation for more than /four.lin/zero.lin years, and 
it still makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Au poivre means “with pepper,” and this pepper cream sauce pairs perfectly with rabbit. The traditional French preparation is made with black peppercorns and typically served with steak, hence Steak au Poivre.

thyme, rosemary, chives, oregano, salt, black pepper, and garlic, and stir well. Pour the marinade over the rabbit pieces, turning to coat each piece well. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.Meat and Poultry 97[ ]
2. MAKE THE COATING AND BROWN:  When ready to cook the 
rabbit, preheat the oven to 450˚F. Remove the rabbit from the 
marinade, and allow the pieces to drain. In a medium bowl, mix the flour, salt, and white pepper.
3. In a 12-inch cast-iron (oven-safe) skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Dredge the rabbit pieces in the seasoned flour, and then brown them in the skillet for 3 to 4 minutes per side, skin-side down first. Place the skillet in the oven, and roast for about 25 minutes, until the rabbit is tender and the internal temperature is 165˚F.
4. MAKE THE PEPPERCORN CREAM SAUCE:  While the rabbit is 
roasting, in a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the shallots and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes, until soft. Add the brandy, and cook until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the green and pink peppercorns, pimento, and heavy cream, and bring to a simmer, stirring with a wire whisk to keep it from boiling over. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 10 minutes, until the cream is thickened. Stir in the salt and set aside.
5. When the rabbit is done, transfer the pieces to a serving platter, spoon the peppercorn cream sauce over the top, and serve immediately.Complete Cajun Cookbook 98/S.ss09/t.ss09/u.ss09/f.ss09/f.ss09/e.ss09/d.ss09 /P.ss09/o.ss09/r.ss09/k.ss09 /L.ss09/o.ss09/i.ss09/n.ss09 /w.ss09/i.ss09/t.ss09/h.ss09

I serve this variation of a corn bread-stuffed pork loin during the holidays. 
Calcasieu sauce is a spicy combination of tasso and tricolor bell peppers cooked in a chicken veloute cream. A veloute sauce is made with any stock thickened with a blond roux and sometimes finished with a heavy cream. The word calca-sieu comes from the Louisiana parish of the same name (originally the name of the Atakapa chief and a nearby river). It means “crying eagle” in the Atakapan language.

1. PREPARE THE PORK LOIN FOR STUFFING:  Preheat the oven to 
325˚F. Use a long-bladed knife to cut through the center of 
the loin lengthwise, making a 2- to 3-inch-wide slit the entire length from end to end without cutting through the long side; this creates a cavity for the corn bread stuffing. Season the outside of the roast with the salt and black pepper.
2. MAKE THE STUFFING:  In a large bowl, combine the orange 
segments, crumbled corn bread, orange juice, orange liqueur, parsley, rosemary, thyme, salt, and black pepper, and mix well, ensuring no large lumps of corn bread remain. This mixture will be somewhat moist. If it is too dry, add more orange juice or orange liqueur.
3. Spoon the stuffing into a pastry bag or a gallon zip-top bag. (If using the zip-top bag, cut a 1-inch opening from one corner of the bag.) Force the mixture into the loin until the cavity is filled well. Place the stuffed pork loin in a large roasting pan. If you have extra stuffing, put it around the outside of the loin just prior to roasting. Roast for 1½    hours, or until the internal temperature is 145˚F.
4. MAKE THE SAUCE:  When the pork loin is in the last 30 minutes 
of roasting, prepare the calcasieu sauce. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the tasso and stir for about 3 minutes, until browned. Add the onion, celery, and bell pep-pers. Sauté, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes, until the vegetables are wilted and translucent. Add the garlic and stir for 1 minute.
5. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and stir in the flour until fully absorbed into the liquid. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, making a roux-like mixture. Whisk in the chicken stock, and continue to whisk until no lumps remain.Complete Cajun Cookbook 100/S.ss09/t.ss09/u.ss09/f.ss09/f.ss09/e.ss09/d.ss09 /P.ss09/o.ss09/r.ss09/k.ss09 /L.ss09/o.ss09/i.ss09/n.ss09 /w.ss09/i.ss09/t.ss09/h.ss09 /C.ss09/a.ss09/l.ss09/c.ss09/a.ss09/s.ss09/i.ss09/e.ss09/u.ss09 /S.ss09/a.ss09/u.ss09/c.ss09/e.ss09 continued
6. Increase the heat to high, and bring to a rolling simmer. Reduce 
the heat to low and simmer for about 10 minutes. Stir in the heavy cream, and bring back to a simmer for about 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the scallions, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Keep the sauce on a very low heat until ready to serve.
7. When the pork loin is finished roasting, remove the pan from the oven, cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 20 minutes. Slice into 1-inch-thick pieces, and serve with a large spoonful of calcasieu sauce on the top.

Goose is prolific in the marshlands and swamps of South Louisiana. It tastes like 
medium-rare roast beef but with a richer flavor. Because turkey was not always available, my grandmother Boudreaux often prepared goose for Thanksgiving.

The recipe name literally translates to “chicken of the good wife.” This is a coun-
try Cajun variation of a classic French dish. The traditional preparation consists of potatoes trimmed into small ovals, pearl onions, larding bacon, and mush-rooms cooked with chicken. This somewhat simplified and countrified version uses yellow onion, bacon strips, and quartered potatoes.

SERVES 68 bacon strips
1 (4-pound) whole (chicken, 
cut into 8 to 10 pieces (see

1 teaspoon freshly ground black 
pepper, divided
½    teaspoon red pepper flakes2 pounds new red potatoes,

minced
½    cup white wine, preferably 
chardonnay
½    cup chicken stock1 tablespoon minced fresh 
thyme
¼    cup chopped fresh parsley
1. Preheat the oven to 350˚F. In a 12-inch cast-iron (oven-safe) 
skillet, cook the bacon strips over medium-high heat for 6 to 8 minutes, until crispy. Place the cooked bacon on a paper towel–lined plate, keeping the bacon grease in the skillet.
2. Season the chicken pieces with ½    teaspoon of salt, ½    teaspoon of black pepper, and the red pepper flakes. In the skillet with the bacon grease, cook the chicken over medium-high heat for 3 to 5 minutes per side, until browned evenly all over. Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside.
3. Toss the potatoes with the remaining ½    teaspoon of salt and black pepper; then place in the skillet. Cook over medium heat, turning occasionally to keep them from burning, for 3 to 5 minutes per side, until browned all over. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.Meat and Poultry 103[ ]
4. Place the onion in the skillet, and cook over medium heat for 
about 5 minutes, until softened and slightly browned. Add the garlic and stir for 1 minute. Transfer the onion and garlic to a bowl and set aside. Deglaze the skillet with the wine and chicken stock for about 2 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any browned bits, and simmer over low heat for about 2 minutes.
5. Arrange the chicken in the bottom of the skillet, cover with the potatoes, add the onion-garlic mixture, cooked bacon strips, and sprinkle the thyme and parsley over the top. Cover the skillet and place it in the oven. Braise for 1 hour. Remove the cover and cook for 15 more minutes, until browned on top and bubbling on the sides.
LAGNAPPE TIP: If the whole chicken is more than 4 pounds, cut the two 
breasts in half, giving you 4 pieces of breast meat, so you have 10 pieces 
(4 breasts, 2 legs, 2 thighs, and 2 wings). Back in the day, Cajuns caught their yard chickens as needed for meals. My dad said one of his chores on the farm was to fetch and prepare a chicken for dinner.Complete Cajun Cookbook 104/C.ss09/h.ss09/i.ss09/c.ss09/k.ss09/e.ss09/n.ss09 /F.ss09/r.ss09/i.ss09/c.ss09/a.ss09/s.ss09/s.ss09/e.ss09/e.ss09

Add the garlic and stir for 1 minute. Add the remaining ¼    cup of flour, and stir well to absorb any liquid. Continue to stir and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.Meat and Poultry 105[ ]
4. Add the white wine, and stir well until smoothed into the 
vegetable-flour mixture. Add the chicken stock, mushrooms, and lima beans, and return the browned chicken to the skillet. Bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes.
5. Remove the cover. Stir in the heavy cream, parsley, scallions, and salt and pepper to taste; then continue to simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. Serve the chicken and sauce over cooked white rice.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: Although this fricassee recipe uses chicken, you can make 
the dish with any meat available, including rabbit and veal. The base sauce is a canvas for many variations.Complete Cajun Cookbook 106/D.ss09/o.ss09/v.ss09/e.ss09/s.ss09 /C.ss09/h.ss09/a.ss09/s.ss09/s.ss09/e.ss09/u.ss09/r.ss09
The French sauce chasseur means “hunters’ sauce,” and it’s great with many vari-
eties of poultry as well as game like quail, duck, or dove, which is used here. The 
sauce originated with hunters who picked wild mushrooms while out scouting for their game meats. The dish has evolved to include sautéed mushrooms with wine. Pair it with cooked white rice.
PREP TIME:
30 MINUTES, PLUS OVER-NIGHT TO MARINATE
COOK TIME:
1 HOUR 30 MINUTES
SERVES 612 (about 4-ounce) doves
2 (750 ml) bottles red wine, 
preferably cabernet or merlot, 
divided
2 teaspoons kosher salt
2 teaspoons white pepper8 bacon slices2 cups all-purpose flour, divided3 cups chicken stock¼    cup Worcestershire sauce¼    teaspoon hot sauce2 cups diced tomatoes1 pound (5 cups) sliced 
mushrooms
1 tablespoon lemon juice¼    cup chopped fresh parsley
1. Rinse the doves well under cool water and then dry. Place the 
cleaned doves in a large plastic container and completely cover with wine, reserving 1 cup. Cover and marinate overnight in the refrigerator. After marinating, drain the doves, and season inside and out with the salt and white pepper.
2. In a 12-inch cast-iron Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat for 8 minutes, until crispy. Set aside the bacon on a paper towel–lined plate.
3. Pour 1¾    cups of flour into a large bowl. Dredge the doves in the flour to coat evenly. Working in batches, brown the doves in the bacon grease still in the Dutch oven on all sides over medium-high heat for 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove the browned doves and set aside.Meat and Poultry 107[ ]
4. Add the remaining ¼    cup of flour to the grease in the Dutch 
oven to make a roux, and cook over medium heat until browned. Deglaze the pan with the reserved wine, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any stuck-on roux. Whisk in the chicken stock, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce, and stir well. Bring to a simmer; then add the tomatoes, mushrooms, and lemon juice.
5. Put the doves back in the Dutch oven, breast-side up, crumble the bacon over the doves, cover, and simmer over low heat for 1 hour, or until the internal temperature is 160˚F. Sprinkle the parsley over the top. Serve 2 doves per person with the mush-room sauce.
SUBSTITUTION TIP:  I’ve made this dish with chicken breasts and quail. If 
you don’t have dove, 1 chicken breast per person or 1 quail per person works 
perfectly.Complete Cajun Cookbook 108/M.ss09/i.ss09/n.ss09/i.ss09 /C.ss09/a.ss09/s.ss09/s.ss09/o.ss09/u.ss09/l.ss09/e.ss09/t.ss09
Cassoulet (named after the pot in which it is cooked) is a casserole containing 
meat and beans that originated as country food in the South of France. This is my mom Martha Boudreaux’s Cajun take on the classic French preparation. Her version is a layered approach with cooked navy beans, pork chops, sausage, tomatoes, garlic, onion, and Swiss cheese. In other words, the perfect one-pot dish for the family.
PREP TIME:
30 MINUTES
COOK TIME:
4 HOURS
SERVES 43 tablespoons unsalted butter, 
divided
1 large yellow onion
2 whole cloves1 pound dry navy beans6 cups cool water4 boneless pork chops½    pound spicy smoked sausage, 
diced2 cups diced tomatoes6 garlic cloves, minced1 teaspoon dried thyme1 teaspoon dried rosemary½    teaspoon kosher salt½    teaspoon freshly ground 
black pepper
¼    cup bread crumbs¼    cup grated Swiss cheese
1. Grease a 9-by-9-inch casserole dish with 1 tablespoon of butter.
2. Stud the onion with the 2 whole cloves by sticking the pointed 
end of each clove into the onion. In a 6-quart stockpot, com-bine the beans, clove-studded onion, and cool water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1½    to 2 hours, until the beans are tender but not mushy. Drain the beans, reserving the liquid and the onion, and discard the whole cloves. Mash the onion and set aside. Set aside the cooked drained beans.
3. In a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add the pork chops and cook for about 5 minutes per side, until browned evenly. Remove the pork chops and set aside.Meat and Poultry 109[ ]
4. Put the spicy sausage in the same skillet, along with ½    cup of 
reserved bean liquid, and allow the liquid to reduce until it is almost gone. Add the tomatoes, garlic, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and set aside.
5. Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Place half the cooked navy beans in the prepared casserole dish as a first layer. Add the pork chops over the beans for the second layer; then spread the sausage-tomato mixture over the pork chops for the third layer.
6. Add the mashed onion as the fourth layer; then cover with the remaining cooked navy beans for the fifth and final layer. Cover the casserole dish with aluminum foil, and bake for 1 ½    hours.
7. In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs and Swiss cheese. Remove the casserole from the oven, and evenly sprinkle the bread crumb mixture over the top.
8. Increase the oven temperature to 400˚F, and bake the casse-role, uncovered, for 10 minutes, or until the cheese melts and the top browns.111[]

In Louisiana, court bouillon is pronounced “COO-bee-yon.” It comes from the 
traditional French preparation for a short broth for poaching fish and seafood. Its light, wine-flavored liquid with tomatoes and herbs adds such rich flavor to the fish or seafood, and the Trinity, cayenne pepper, hot sauce, scallions, and parsley make it uniquely Cajun-flavored. It’s perfect served over rice.
PREP TIME:
30 MINUTES
COOK TIME:
1 HOUR
SERVES 4½    cup vegetable oil
½    cup all-purpose flour1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided1 teaspoon freshly ground black 
pepper, divided
½    teaspoon cayenne pepper2 pounds redfish or red snapper, 
cut into 4 fillets
2 tablespoons unsalted butter1 cup diced yellow onion½    cup diced celery½    cup diced green bell pepper6 garlic cloves, minced2 cups diced tomatoes2 cups white wine, preferably 
chardonnay
1 cup seafood stock1 tablespoon Worcestershire 
sauce
1 teaspoon hot sauce1 teaspoon dried thyme1 teaspoon marjoram½    cup chopped scallions, green 
parts only
½    cup chopped fresh parsley1 lemon, cut into 8 roundsCooked white rice
1. In a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, heat the vegetable oil over 
medium heat.
2. While the oil heats, in a large bowl, combine the flour with ½    teaspoon of salt, ½    teaspoon of black pepper, and the cayenne pepper, and stir well. Dredge the fish fillets in the seasoned flour; then add the coated fish to the skillet. Fry the fish for 3 to 5 minutes per side, until it is browned and crispy all over. Transfer the fish to a paper towel–lined platter and set aside. Discard the spent fry oil.Seafood 113[ ]
3. In the same cast-iron skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. 
Add the Trinity of onion, celery, and bell pepper. Sauté, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes, until wilted and translucent. Add the garlic and stir for 1 minute. Add the diced tomatoes, wine, seafood stock, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, thyme, and marjoram. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes.
4. Gently add the fried fish fillets to the liquid, cover the skillet, and simmer for about 20 minutes. Do not stir; you want to keep the fish fillets whole. Remove the cover, add the scallions, pars-ley, lemon slices, and remaining ½    teaspoon of salt and pepper, and continue to simmer for 5 minutes. Serve the fish and liquid in large bowls over cooked white rice.
LAGNIAPPE TIP:  Make it a seafood feast. Add ½    pound of shrimp and a pint 
of shucked oysters to the mix in the middle of step 4, just before adding the 
scallions, parsley, and lemon slices. Cook for 5 to 8 more minutes, until the shrimp are pink and the oysters are curled at the edges.Complete Cajun Cookbook 114/S.ss09/h.ss09/r.ss09/i.ss09/m.ss09/p.ss09 /a.ss09/n.ss09/d.ss09 /G.ss09/r.ss09/i.ss09/t.ss09/s.ss09
This relative newcomer to the Cajun culinary scene is a popular brunch dish 
at homes and restaurants all along the Gulf coast and beyond. It first appeared in food and travel articles around the /one.lin/nine.lin/eight.lin/zero.lins, referencing Charleston, South Carolina, and became well known after Craig Claiborne wrote about it in the New/uni00A0York Times in /one.lin/nine.lin/eight.lin/five.lin. But once Cajuns took hold of it and made it their own, they brought the dish to a whole new level, adding more spices and even some-times Tasso (page /eight.lin/four.lin).

1 large egg, beaten2 tablespoons cool water
1. Grease a baking sheet with 1 tablespoon of butter or line it with 
a sheet of parchment paper. Dust a work surface with flour and place the puff pastry on it. Allow the pastry to come to room temperature.
2. In a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, cook the bacon over medium heat for 6 to 8 minutes, until crisp. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in the same skillet. Add the Trinity of onion, celery, and bell pepper, plus the Cajun seasoning. Sauté, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes, until the vegetables are wilted and translucent. Add the garlic and stir for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir well while cooking down the sea-sonings. Add the crawfish tails to the skillet and heat through, stirring frequently, for 3 to 5 minutes.Seafood 117[ ]
3. In a small bowl, whisk the flour into the chicken stock until well 
dissolved; then add the mixture to the skillet with the crawfish. Bring to a low simmer, still over medium-low heat, and stir well to thicken for 3 to 5 minutes. Turn off the heat.
4. In a medium bowl, combine the cream cheese with the cheddar cheese, and mix well to incorporate. Fold the cream cheese mixture into the skillet mixture, and stir until well incorporated. Fold in the scallions and parsley, and allow the filling to cool to room temperature, 30 to 45 minutes.
5. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Cut the puff pastry dough into 4 even squares, for 8 squares total measuring about 4 inches square each.
6. In a small bowl, make an egg wash with the beaten egg and cool water. Brush each pastry dough square with the egg wash; then spoon about ¼    cup of the crawfish filling onto the center of each dough square.
7. Fold the dough squares to form a triangle; then crimp the edges with the tines of a fork. Brush the top of each crawfish pie with more egg wash; then transfer it to the greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve immediately.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: Crawfish pies have been around for generations, with 
some recipes dating back to the 18th century. Typically crawfish pies are made in individual piecrusts similar to a chicken potpie.Complete Cajun Cookbook 118/C.ss09/r.ss09/a.ss09/w.ss09/f.ss09/i.ss09/s.ss09/h.ss09 /B.ss09/i.ss09/s.ss09/q.ss09/u.ss09/e.ss09
Handed down from my in-laws, Clayton and Jeannette Boyer, this recipe is a 
time-honored Cajun favorite. After migrating to South Louisiana from Quebec, Cajuns found that lobsters were not so easily accessible.

unsalted butter
½    cup all-purpose flour½    tablespoon tomato paste4 cups seafood stock1 cup heavy cream½    cup brandy½    teaspoon kosher salt½    teaspoon cayenne pepper
1. PREPARE THE BOILED CRAWFISH:  Remove the crawfish tails and 
peel, reserving the cleaned tail meat and orange fat in separate 
bowls; you will use half the tail meat and orange fat in steps 2 and 3 and half the tail meat and orange fat when you make the bisque. Clean the head shells by removing the membranes Seafood 119continued > [ ]
and innards, rinsing the head shells in cool water, draining, and 
patting dry. Reserve the head shells for stuffing.
2. MAKE THE STUFFED CRAWFISH HEADS:  Preheat the oven to 
400°F. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the onion, celery, bell pepper, scallions, garlic, and parsley, and process until ground. Add half the crawfish tail meat to the processor, and continue to process to a uniform consistency.
3. In a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the processed vegetables and ground crawfish and sauté for about 5 minutes, until the vegetables are soft. Remove from the heat and allow it to cool for about 30 minutes.
4. To the same skillet, add half the crawfish fat and the egg; then mix in the bread crumbs, salt, and cayenne pepper. Stuff the cleaned crawfish heads with the filling, 1 to 2 tablespoons per head, depending on the size. Dredge the stuffed section of the crawfish heads in flour, place them on a sheet pan, and bake for 20 minutes.
5. MAKE THE BISQUE:  In the bowl of a food processor, combine the 
yellow onion, celery, bell pepper, half the scallions, the garlic, and parsley, and process until ground.
6. In a 6-quart cast-iron Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to make a light roux. Stir and cook for about 5 minutes, until it is a blond color. Reduce the heat to low, add the ground vegetables, and cook for about 10 minutes, until soft and translucent. Add the tomato paste, and smooth into the vegetables; then stir in the reserved crawfish fat and the seafood stock. Whisk to remove any roux lumps, and simmer for about 10 minutes.Complete Cajun Cookbook 120/C.ss09/r.ss09/a.ss09/w.ss09/f.ss09/i.ss09/s.ss09/h.ss09 /B.ss09/i.ss09/s.ss09/q.ss09/u.ss09/e.ss09 continued
7. Fold in the remaining crawfish tail meat; then add the heavy 
cream, brandy, salt, and cayenne pepper. Gently add the baked, stuffed crawfish heads to the soup, and simmer for about 15 minutes. Add the remaining chopped scallions, and serve immediately in deep soup bowls.
SUBSTITUTION TIP: /uni00A0If you cannot find live crawfish, some stores sell them 
already boiled and frozen. In that case, you’ll save time because you won’t 
be able to stuff the heads. This leaves you two options: make the stuffing 
without the heads and use 1½    pounds of tail meat in the bisque or make 
the stuffing without the heads by rolling it into balls, flouring them, baking in the oven, and adding them to the bisque just as you would the stuffed heads. If crawfish tail meat is not available, you can substitute 3 pounds (70 to 90 count) raw shrimp, peeled and deveined.Seafood 121/C.ss09/r.ss09/a.ss09/w.ss09/f.ss09/i.ss09/s.ss09/h.ss09 /B.ss09/o.ss09/i.ss09/l.ss09

1. In a 20-quart or larger stockpot, combine the water, crab boil, 
salt, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, cayenne pepper, half the onions, half the celery, half the garlic, and half the lemons. Cover the pot, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes.
2. Add 10 pounds of crawfish, cover, increase the heat to high, and bring back to a boil. Turn off the heat and allow the crawfish to soak in the spicy liquid for about 15 minutes. The crawfish are done when they float to the top. Using a slotted spoon or skim-mer, transfer the crawfish, onion, celery, garlic, and lemons to a large serving dish, and set it out on a newspaper-lined table.
3. Add the remaining onion, celery, garlic, and lemons to the remaining liquid in the stockpot, cover, and bring back to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the remaining crawfish and repeat step 2.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: Crab boil is a spice mix typically sold in the spice aisles of 
grocery stores. If you’d like to include some sides here, consider boiled corn (6 small cobs), new potatoes (6 each), sausage (3 links), Boudin (page 29), and/or artichokes (2 whole).

Alligator hunting season in Louisiana takes place in August and September and 
is a true event for those eager to make recipes like this chili. Many say alligator tastes a bit like quail but with a firmer texture like chicken and a hint of fish essence. This chili is an especially popular dish at hunting camps. If you like, you can serve it over rice or pasta.

Louisiana Cajun/Creole-style bordelaise sauce consists of unsalted butter, 
garlic, shallots, scallions, and parsley and is a departure from the classic French  bordelaise sauce, which is (/one.lin) made with red wine and a demi-glace and (/two.lin) served primarily with beef steaks, like filet or rib eye. The Louisiana-style sauce, with its garlic butter, white wine, and lemon zest, pairs perfectly with frog legs.
PREP TIME:

COOK TIME:
30 MINUTES
SERVES 4FOR THE FROG LEGS
8 pairs (16 total) frog legs
2 cups buttermilk2 teaspoons hot sauce2 cups all-purpose flour1 tablespoon kosher salt½    teaspoon white pepper1 cup peanut oil
FOR THE BORDELAISE SAUCE
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted 
butter
½    pound (2 ½    cups) sliced 
button mushrooms2 tablespoons minced garlic1 tablespoon minced dry shallot¼    cup white wine, preferably 
chardonnay
1 tablespoon Worcestershire 
sauce
1 tablespoon lemon zest¼    cup chopped fresh parsley½    teaspoon kosher salt¼    teaspoon cayenne pepper
1. PREPARE THE FROG LEGS:  If the frog legs are in pairs, find the 
hip joint on each side of the legs. Using a boning knife, gently 
cut through the joint on each side of the hip to separate the two legs. Rinse the frog legs and pat dry.
2. In a large bowl, combine the buttermilk and hot sauce; then add the frog legs and turn well to evenly coat each leg. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.
3. In another large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and pepper. Shake off any excess buttermilk from the chilled frog legs, drop them in the flour mixture, and dredge until lightly coated.Seafood 125[ ]
4. In a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat, heat the peanut 
oil to 350˚F, measured on a deep-fry thermometer. Working in batches, add the frog legs in a single layer, and panfry for about 5 minutes per side, until golden brown on both sides. Transfer to a paper towel–lined platter.
5. MAKE THE BORDELAISE SAUCE:  In a large saucepan, melt the 
butter over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and sauté for 5 to 8 minutes, stirring frequently, until browned. Add the garlic and dry shallot, stir well, and continue to cook for 1 minute. Add the wine and Worcestershire sauce, and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the lemon zest, parsley, salt, and cayenne pepper, stir well, and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes.
6. Transfer the fried frog legs to a serving platter, spoon the  bordelaise sauce evenly over them, and serve immediately.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: There really is no substitution for the delicate frog leg. 
But frog legs themselves make great substitutes for any dish that calls for shrimp or chicken. Just remember that the cook time for frog legs is not nearly as long as for chicken.Complete Cajun Cookbook 126/C.ss09/r.ss09/a.ss09/b.ss09/m.ss09/e.ss09/a.ss09/t.ss09 /e.ss09/n.ss09 /C.ss09/r.ss09/o.ss09/u.ss09/t.ss09/e.ss09
The Cajun influence in this dish comes from the Cajun Trinity and chopped 
 scallions in the sauce. Here, you’ll be making a classic French veloute sauce, which is a basic “mother sauce,” using chicken stock and thickening it with a/uni00A0roux. Once the heavy cream is added to the veloute sauce, it becomes a clas-sic supreme sauce, one of many “daughter sauces” that can be derived from a/uni00A0veloute. En croute means “baked in a pastry crust.”
PREP TIME:
20 MINUTES
COOK TIME:
1 HOUR
SERVES 45 tablespoons (½    stick plus 
1 tablespoon) unsalted butter, 
divided
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, 
plus more for dusting
1 sheet puff pastry dough, 
thawed
½    cup chopped yellow onion
½    cup chopped celery½    cup chopped green bell 
pepper
1 ½    cups chicken stock, warmed1 (14-ounce) can quartered 
artichoke hearts in water, 
drained
1 cup heavy cream
1 pound lump crabmeat, 
cleaned
½    cup chopped scallions, green 
parts only
½    teaspoon kosher salt½    teaspoon white pepper1 large egg, beaten1 tablespoon cool water
1. Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Using 1 tablespoon of butter, 
grease 4 (1½   -cup) ramekins. Dust a work surface with flour and place the puff pastry on it. Allow the pastry to come to room temperature.
2. In a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, melt the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat. Add the Trinity of onion, celery, and bell pepper. Sauté, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes, until wilted and translucent.
3. Stir in the flour, and mix well for 5 minutes to make a blond roux. Whisk in the warmed chicken stock until no lumps remain. Add the artichoke hearts and heavy cream, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for about 10 minutes, until thickened.Seafood 127[ ]
4. Fold in the lump crabmeat, scallions, salt, and pepper, and 
simmer over low heat for about 2 minutes, until heated through. Spoon the crabmeat sauce evenly into each ramekin.
5. In a small bowl, combine the beaten egg and water to make an egg wash. Cut the tempered puff pastry dough into 4 even squares measuring about 4 inches square each. Brush the tops of the puff pastry dough squares with the egg wash; then place the squares, brushed-side down, on the ramekins. Brush more egg wash over the top of the puff pastry dough.
6. Place the ramekins on a sheet pan. Bake for 30 minutes, until the puff dough is golden brown. Serve immediately.
SUBSTITUTION TIP: One pound (70 to 90 count) of shrimp and 1 pound of 
small bay scallops make great substitutions for the crabmeat in this dish. To 
keep the scallops or shrimp from weeping too much liquid into the supreme sauce, poach them in a little white wine in a medium saucepan over medium heat for about 3 minutes. Drain them well; then add them when you would add the crabmeat.Complete Cajun Cookbook 128/O.ss09/y.ss09/s.ss09/t.ss09/e.ss09/r.ss09 /P.ss09/a.ss09/t.ss09/t.ss09/i.ss09/e.ss09/s.ss09
A Cajun favorite for celebrations, oyster patties are made with puff pastry shells, 
found in the freezer section of most grocery stores. The French name for the puff pastry shell is vol-au-vent, meaning “windblown,” which describes the light airiness of the pastry shell.
PREP TIME:
10 MINUTES
COOK TIME:
50 MINUTES
SERVES 66 (3-inch round) frozen puff 
pastry shells
1 pint oysters, with liquor 
reserved
4 tablespoons (½    stick) 
unsalted butter
½    cup diced yellow onion
1 tablespoon minced garlic½    teaspoon celery seed½    teaspoon cayenne pepper½    teaspoon kosher salt½    cup all-purpose flour2 cups dairy milk½    teaspoon ground nutmeg½    cup chopped scallions, green 
parts only
2 tablespoons chopped fresh 
parsley
1. Bake the frozen puff pastry shells per the package direc-
tions. Cool on a baking sheet and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350˚F.
2. Drain the oysters, reserving the liquid. Check for any shells; then chop the oysters into small pieces. Set aside.
3. In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft. Add the garlic, celery seed, cayenne pepper, and salt, and stir and sauté for 1 minute. Stir in the flour to make a blond roux. Reduce the heat to low and cook for about 3 minutes.
4. Whisk in the milk, ½    cup of reserved oyster liquid, and the nutmeg. Whisk until no lumps remain. Increase the heat to medium, and bring to a simmer. Fold in the reserved chopped oysters, add the scallions and parsley, and continue to simmer for 5 minutes.
5. Spoon the oyster cream sauce evenly into the baked puff pastry shells. Bake for 15 minutes, or until lightly browned.Seafood 129/G.ss09/r.ss09/i.ss09/l.ss09/l.ss09/e.ss09/d.ss09 /R.ss09/e.ss09/d.ss09/f.ss09/i.ss09/s.ss09/h.ss09 /o.ss09/n.ss09 /t.ss09/h.ss09/e.ss09 /H.ss09/a.ss09/l.ss09/f.ss09 /S.ss09/h.ss09/e.ss09/l.ss09/l.ss09
Nothing tastes better than hauling in freshly caught redfish and exposing the 
thick, rich, meaty fillet. Redfish has a mild, sweet flavor with a medium-firm texture. Leaving the scales and skin on while cooking gives the fillets their own individual “platters” to cook in over the grill or under the broiler. Just remember not to eat the skin and scales; you’ll be discarding the “shell.”
PREP TIME:
20 MINUTES
COOK TIME:
10 MINUTES
SERVES 44 redfish fillets, cleaned with 
skin and scales intact
1 cup Italian salad dressing
3 tablespoons barbecue sauce¼    cup minced yellow onion1 tablespoon minced garlic1 tablespoon Tennessee whiskey 
(or any favorite liquor, such 
as bourbon, rye, or spiced whiskey)
½    teaspoon kosher salt
½    teaspoon freshly ground 
black pepper
1. Place the redfish fillets on a sheet pan ready to grill. Prepare 
your charcoal or gas grill for direct grilling, making sure the grates are hot.
2. In the bowl of a blender, combine the salad dressing, barbe-cue sauce, onion, garlic, whiskey, salt, and pepper. Blend until combined into a smooth mixture. Pour half the sauce into a container to reserve on the side for serving; then brush the redfish fillets evenly with some of the other half of the sauce (which you’ll also use to baste while grilling).
3. Grill the redfish fillets, skin-side down, on the grill grates, and baste frequently with the first half of the sauce. Continue cook-ing and basting for about 10 minutes, until the redfish fillets are fully cooked, are white in color, and flake easily with a fork.
4. Serve immediately with the reserved sauce on the side, and don’t forget to remind guests not to eat the skin and scales.
SUBSTITUTION TIP:  If you haven’t caught any redfish yourself, fish mon-
gers who sell whole fish can fillet them with the skin and scales intact. Red 
drum or red snapper can replace the redfish in this recipe.Complete Cajun Cookbook 130/B.ss09/r.ss09/o.ss09/i.ss09/l.ss09/e.ss09/d.ss09 /S.ss09/o.ss09/f.ss09/t.ss09-/S.ss09/h.ss09/e.ss09/l.ss09/l.ss09 /C.ss09/r.ss09/a.ss09/b.ss09/s.ss09
Rather than the usual fried version, this Cajun take on soft-shell crabs marinates 
them in lemon, butter, olive oil, and Worcestershire sauce in the refrigerator. Then they are broiled from above or grilled in a basket over hot coals. The result is so succulent and tender, you’ll never go back to fried.
PREP TIME:
10 MINUTES, PLUS 4 HOURS TO CHILL
COOK TIME:
15 MINUTES
SERVES 61 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter
¼    cup fresh lemon juice, from 
2 medium lemons
2 tablespoons lemon pepper1 tablespoon extra-virgin 
olive oil½    tablespoon Worcestershire 
sauce
1 teaspoon kosher salt¼    teaspoon white pepper6 soft-shell crabs, cleaned and 
rinsed
1. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the 
lemon juice, lemon pepper, olive oil, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and white pepper, and mix well.
2. Arrange the soft-shell crabs on a sheet pan, and coat each crab on both sides and under the shell flaps with the warm butter mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Reserve the marinade mixture if you’re grilling (see Lagniappe Tip).
3. Preheat the broiler to the high setting or 500˚F.
4. Place the soft-shell crabs on a broiler pan shell-side down; then place the broiler pan on a sheet pan to catch the juices. Place the whole pan about 6 inches from the broiler flame. Every 2 to 3 minutes, baste the crabs with the juices to keep them moist. After 5 minutes, turn over the soft-shell crabs with the shell side up, and continue broiling and basting for about 5 minutes, until browned. Serve immediately on individual plates.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: If grilling the soft-shell crabs, have your barbecue hot and 
ready in step 3. Place the crabs in a grilling basket, and start grilling them with the shell side up 2 to 3 inches from the heat, basting them often with the reserved marinade liquid. Halfway through, after 3 to 4 minutes (watch them closely) turn them over with the shell side down, and continue to baste until done.Seafood 131/B.ss09/r.ss09/o.ss09/i.ss09/l.ss09/e.ss09/d.ss09 /F.ss09/l.ss09/o.ss09/u.ss09/n.ss09/d.ss09/e.ss09/r.ss09
Flounder can be fished in South Louisiana’s shallow bays and lakes from 
summer to early fall, when the water temperatures are warmer. As the waters cool down in winter months, flounder migrate offshore into deeper water to spawn but can still be fished year-round. Here, white, flaky, mild, boneless floun-der fillets are broiled and served with a spicy Cajun cream sauce.
PREP TIME:
10 MINUTES
COOK TIME:
35 MINUTES
SERVES 62 cups heavy cream
1 tablespoon Cajun Seasoning 
(page 19)
½    tablespoon Worcestershire 
sauce
½    tablespoon hot sauce½    cup chopped scallions, green 
parts only
6 (4-ounce) flounder fillets1 cup white wine, preferably 
chardonnay
4 tablespoons (½    stick) 
unsalted butter, melted
½    teaspoon kosher salt½    teaspoon cayenne pepper¼    teaspoon paprika¼    cup chopped fresh parsley
1. In a large saucepan, bring the heavy cream to a simmer over 
medium heat. Whisk while the cream reduces so it does not boil over.
2. As the heavy cream simmers, whisk in the Cajun seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce. Continue to simmer, and whisk for about 10 minutes, until the mixture is thickened to a sauce consistency. (It will coat the back of a spoon.) Toss in the scallions and stir well. Keep warm on very low heat.
3. Place a rack about 6 inches from the heating unit, and turn the broiler to high or 500˚F.
4. Place the flounder fillets on a sheet pan. In a small bowl, mix the wine, melted butter, salt, and cayenne pepper. Pour the mixture over the flounder, and sprinkle with the paprika and parsley. Broil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the flounder is flaky. Transfer the fillets to serving plates, and serve immediately, spooning the warm Cajun cream sauce evenly over each.Complete Cajun Cookbook 132/C.ss09/r.ss09/a.ss09/w.ss09/f.ss09/i.ss09/s.ss09/h.ss09 /I.ss09/m.ss09/p.ss09/e.ss09/r.ss09/i.ss09/a.ss09/l.ss09

Native Americans in Louisiana have been eating oysters for thousands of years, 
so when Cajuns came to the area, they adopted these bivalves as an excellent source of protein. Perfected at Drago’s Restaurant in Metairie, Louisiana, owner Tommy Cvitanovich’s grilled oysters continue to have a loyal following—and with good reason. These mouthwatering morsels are to die for and are great with French bread for sopping up the juices.
PREP TIME:

SERVES 41 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, 
at room temperature
4 tablespoons minced garlic
1 teaspoon freshly ground black 
pepper
1 teaspoon dried oregano½    cup grated Parmesan cheese½    cup grated Romano cheese1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf 
parsley
24 large oysters, freshly 
shucked on the half shell
French bread, sliced
1. Heat your gas or charcoal grill to the highest setting.
2. In a medium bowl, mix together the softened butter, garlic, 
pepper, and oregano. Set aside.
3. In a separate medium bowl, mix together the Parmesan cheese, Romano cheese, and chopped parsley. Set aside.
4. Place the oysters over the hottest part of the grill. Keep the grill uncovered.
5. Ladle or spoon the garlic-butter mixture generously over the oysters; don’t worry if some of the butter drips into the coals because it helps give the oysters a smoky flavor.
6. The oysters are ready after about 5 minutes, when they puff up a bit and the edges curl.
7. Remove the oysters from the grill, and transfer them to serving plates, 6 oysters per person. Sprinkle the tops of the oysters with the grated cheese–parsley mixture. Serve immediately with sliced French bread.135[]

Mirliton, also known as a vegetable pear or chayote pear, is an edible gourd with 
a firm greenish flesh. It’s perfect for casseroles or stuffing with a delicious filling, as you’ll see in this recipe. This recipe can be a meal in itself or served as a side with a main dish like Broiled Flounder (page /one.lin/three.lin/one.lin).
PREP TIME:
15 MINUTES
COOK TIME:
1 HOUR 45 MINUTES
SERVES 63 medium mirlitons
1 teaspoon kosher salt2 tablespoons unsalted butter½    cup chopped yellow onion½    cup chopped celery½    cup chopped green bell 
pepper
¾    cup chopped ham2 tablespoons minced garlic2 tablespoons chopped fresh 
parsley1 cup seafood stock1 teaspoon hot sauce½    pound (70 to 90 count) raw 
shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 ½    cups Italian bread crumbs2 tablespoons grated Parmesan 
cheese
1 teaspoon Cajun Seasoning 
(page 19)
1. In a 6-quart stockpot, cover the mirlitons with cool water and 
the salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook for 1 hour, until fork tender.
2. Drain and cool the mirlitons in a bowl of cool water. When cooled, cut lengthwise into even halves. Remove the seeds and scoop out the pulp, leaving about ¼    inch intact. Reserve the pulp in a bowl, and place the mirliton shells on a sheet pan.
3. Preheat the oven to 350˚F.
4. In a 12-inch cast-iron skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the Trinity of onion, celery, and bell pepper. Sauté, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes, until wilted and translucent. Add the ham and cook, stirring frequently, for about 5 more minutes, until browned. Stir in the garlic and parsley, and con-tinue to cook for 1 minute.Vegetables and Salads 143[ ]
5. Add the seafood stock, hot sauce, and reserved mirliton pulp. 
Bring to a simmer while mashing the pulp. Add the shrimp, and continue to simmer for 5 minutes, or until the shrimp are pink. Fold in the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and Cajun season-ing. Mix well, and remove from the heat.
6. Divide the shrimp stuffing evenly among the 6 mirliton shells. Bake for about 25 minutes, until golden brown on top.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: This dish freezes well, so if you want to make it ahead; just 
set the stuffed mirlitons in a freezer container after stuffing them in step 6 but before baking in the oven. When ready to serve, pull them out to thaw in the refrigerator overnight, and then bake.
SUBSTITUTION TIP:  Crabmeat is a great substitution for the shrimp. If mir-
litons are unavailable, you can make the dish using zucchini. Cut them in half 
lengthwise and scoop out the pulp in the shape of a dugout canoe. With the zucchini, there is no need to boil them ahead.Complete Cajun Cookbook 144/B.ss09/o.ss09/u.ss09/r.ss09/b.ss09/o.ss09/n.ss09 /Y.ss09/a.ss09/m.ss09/s.ss09
I make this holiday favorite every Thanksgiving and Christmas. Who can resist 
tiny roasted marshmallows mixed with bourbon-laced sweet potatoes? The liquor is actually up to you. Try it with bourbon, whiskey, spiced whiskey, brandy, sherry, or Courvoisier.
PREP TIME:

1. Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Grease a 9-by-13-inch casserole dish 
with 1 tablespoon of butter.
2. MAKE THE POTATOES:  Place the sweet potatoes on a sheet pan, 
and bake for 1 hour (see Substitution Tip for time-saving micro-wave tip), until soft and tender. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 45 minutes. Leave the oven on.Vegetables and Salads 145[ ]
3. Peel the cooled sweet potatoes, and smash half into the 
bottom of the greased casserole dish. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of cinnamon, ½    teaspoon of allspice, ½    teaspoon of cloves, and ¼    teaspoon of nutmeg evenly over the sweet potatoes. Drizzle ½    cup of the liquor evenly over the sweet potatoes; then sprin-kle ½    cup of brown sugar evenly over the sweet potatoes. Top with 8 butter pats, spacing them evenly.
4. Repeat with the second layer of sweet potatoes, spices, liquor, brown sugar, and butter pats.
5. MAKE THE TOPPING:  In a small bowl, combine the pecans, flour, 
melted butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and cinnamon. Stir well, and then evenly spread the topping over the top layer of sweet potatoes.
6. Bake for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and evenly spread the mini marshmallows over the top. Return to the oven and bake for 15 more minutes, until the marshmallows melt and are toasted light brown. Serve immediately.

roast the sweet potatoes. Prick them several times with a fork, and micro-
wave, two at a time, 8 minutes for each batch.Complete Cajun Cookbook 146/S.ss09/t.ss09/u.ss09/f.ss09/f.ss09/e.ss09/d.ss09 /A.ss09/r.ss09/t.ss09/i.ss09/c.ss09/h.ss09/o.ss09/k.ss09/e.ss09/s.ss09
These gems, which are found at local grocery stores and delis throughout 
Louisiana, represent the Italian influence on Cajun food. Eat them cold or warm them up in the oven for a few minutes—either way, what a treat
. My recipe 
follows a traditional preparation, using anchovies, garlic, parsley, Romano and Parmesan cheese, and Italian bread crumbs.
PREP TIME:
45 MINUTES
COOK TIME:
1 HOUR 15 MINUTES, PLUS 30 MINUTES COOLING TIME
SERVES 44 medium artichokes
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon 
kosher salt
3 cups Italian bread crumbs1 cup chopped fresh parsley¾    cup grated Romano cheese¾    cup grated Parmesan cheese¾    cup extra-virgin olive oil, 
divided
¼    cup lemon juice3 tablespoons minced garlic2 tablespoons minced 
anchovies
1 teaspoon freshly ground black 
pepper
1. Cut off the artichoke stems so they can stand on their bottoms. 
Cut off the burr ends from the top of each leaf, ¼    inch to ½    inch from the top.
2. Place the artichokes in a 12-quart stockpot, cover with cool water, add 1 tablespoon of salt, and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes, or until tender. Drain the artichokes and allow to cool for about 30 minutes.
3. In a large bowl, combine the bread crumbs, parsley, Romano cheese, Parmesan cheese, ¼    cup of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, anchovies, remaining 1 teaspoon of salt, and the pepper.
4. Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Stand the artichokes up and spread apart the leaves. Carefully remove and discard the center choke section. Starting on the bottom row, open the leaves around the artichokes and pack them with the bread crumb mixture.
5. When the stuffing is filled to the top row of leaves, open the top and fill it with stuffing.Vegetables and Salads 147[ ]
6. Stand the stuffed artichokes in a 9-by-13-inch dish; then drizzle 
2 tablespoons of olive oil over each, allowing it to run down the sides.
7. Pour about ½    inch of water in the bottom of the dish, cover with aluminum foil, and place it on the middle rack of the oven. Steam the artichokes for about 45 minutes, or until a tender leaf pulls out easily. Serve immediately.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: Stuffed artichokes freeze very well after completing 
step/uni00A05. When ready to serve, thaw the artichokes in the refrigerator over-night or on the countertop for several hours and then pick up with step 6 and steam until heated through.Complete Cajun Cookbook 148/S.ss09/p.ss09/i.ss09/n.ss09/a.ss09/c.ss09/h.ss09, /O.ss09/y.ss09/s.ss09/t.ss09/e.ss09/r.ss09, /a.ss09/n.ss09/d.ss09

Many gardeners in the South grow okra, and it is an integral part of Cajun 
cooking, especially for its role as a base and thickener for gumbo. But there is something about the marriage of okra and tomatoes. When they’re cooked down together, it’s either a flawless side dish for recipes like Eggplant Creole (page/uni00A0/five.lin/zero.lin), Braised Pork Chops (page /eight.lin/five.lin), or Pecan Rice Dressing (page /eight.lin/nine.lin) or a full meal when served over cooked white rice.

This is another of my mom Martha’s timeless dishes. The pairing of ground beef 
and eggplant may not sound like a natural one, but the combination makes for an amazing taste experience. Try it with Pecan Rice Dressing (page /eight.lin/nine.lin), Chicken and Andouille Jambalaya (page /nine.lin/zero.lin), or Cajun Dirty Rice (page /nine.lin/two.lin), or just serve it by itself over cooked rice.

The etymology and source of this dish (pronounced “MOCK-shoo”) are tough 
to pin down. It is believed to be a Cajun French interpretation of an Indian word and a cultural fusion of Creole and Native American food. Corn and tomatoes are cooked together with seasonings and a touch of diced tasso. Add some shrimp and make it a full meal. It also pairs perfectly with Catfish Creole (page/uni00A0/one.lin/two.lin/two.lin) or Chicken à la Bonne Femme (page /one.lin/zero.lin/two.lin).

This traditional and festive dessert is typically made between Christmas and 
Mardi Gras Day every year in South Louisiana. Twelfth Night starts the official Mardi Gras season, and with it king cakes make their first appearance in stores and homes. Even school classes and business offices kick off the season with a weekly king cake party.

¼    cup warm water (110˚F)½    cup plus 2 teaspoons 
granulated sugar, divided
1 (.25-ounce) packet dry yeast¾    cup orange juice2 large eggs, beaten, at room

all-purpose flour, divided, plus 
more for dusting
1 ½    teaspoons table salt
¼    teaspoon ground nutmeg6 tablespoons (¾    stick) 
unsalted butter, at room 
temperature, divided
FOR THE CINNAMON SUGAR
½    cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon ground cinnamonFOR THE EGG WASH
1 large egg, beaten, at room 
temperature
1 tablespoon water, at room 
temperature
FOR THE TINTED SUGAR 
TOPPING
1 ½    cups granulated sugar, 
divided
⅛    teaspoon red food color
⅛    teaspoon blue food color¼    teaspoon green food color¼    teaspoon yellow (gold) food 
color
FOR THE ICING
1 cup powdered sugar4 teaspoons lemon juice2 to 4 tablespoons cool water
1. MAKE THE DOUGH:  In a small saucepan, heat the milk over 
medium heat until it reaches just under a boil. Tiny bubbles will 
form on the sides, which means the milk is scalded. Remove from the heat, allow the scalded milk to cool to 110˚F, and add the warm water.Desserts 159continued > [ ]
2. In a medium bowl, dissolve 2 teaspoons of sugar in the scalded 
milk and warm water. Sprinkle the yeast into the warm liquid, and allow it to sit for 5 minutes; it will form bubbles on the top. Stir well and set aside to ferment for about 10 more minutes. Stir in the orange juice, beaten eggs, and orange zest.
3. In another medium bowl, sift together 4½    cups of flour with the remaining ½    cup of sugar, the salt, and nutmeg. Create a well in the middle of the flour mixture. Pour the yeast mixture into the well, and stir until a smooth dough forms. Working with 1 tablespoon at a time, use the tines of a fork or a pastry cutter tool to cut in 4 tablespoons of butter. Cut the butter into tiny pieces the size of small peas until you can form the dough into a soft ball.
4. Lightly flour a work surface and turn the dough ball onto it. Knead the dough, adding a few tablespoons of flour at a time, up to 1 cup, to prevent sticking. Continue to knead the dough for about 10 minutes, or until it is smooth, shiny, and elastic.
5. Grease the inside of a large bowl with 1 tablespoon of butter. Place the dough ball in the greased bowl and rotate until the entire surface is coated in butter. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and place it in a draft-free location for about 1½    hours to rise. The dough should double in volume. Grease a large sheet pan with the remaining 1 tablespoon of tem-pered butter.
6. MAKE THE CINNAMON SUGAR:  In a small bowl, combine the 
sugar and cinnamon and set aside.Complete Cajun Cookbook 160/K.ss09/i.ss09/n.ss09/g.ss09 /C.ss09/a.ss09/k.ss09/e.ss09 continued
7. Once the dough has doubled in size, remove it from the bowl, 
and place it on a lightly floured surface. Using your fist, punch down the dough. With a rolling pin, roll it out into a ¼   -inch-thick rectangle, about 18 inches by 24 inches. Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over the entire top of the dough sheet. Beginning at the long end closest to you, start rolling the dough to form a jelly roll–type cylinder until you reach the end. Transfer the dough seam-side down onto the greased sheet pan. Loop the ends together to form a complete circle shape.
8. Cover the dough again with a kitchen towel, and allow it to rise again in a draft-free location for about 45 minutes, or until it doubles in volume again.
9. MAKE THE EGG WASH:  In a small bowl, whisk together the 
beaten egg with the cool water. Brush the top and sides of the dough with the egg wash.
10. When ready to bake, center a rack in the oven and preheat to 350˚F. Bake for about 30 minutes, until golden brown. Transfer to a cooling rack and allow to cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. If you have a plastic baby or uncooked bean, you can hide it in the bottom side of the cake after it’s completely cool.
11. MAKE THE TINTED SUGAR:  While the cake cools, place ½    cup 
of granulated sugar in each of 3 small bowls. Add ⅛    teaspoon each of the red and blue food coloring to 1 bowl of sugar, and stir well after several drops to make the purple sugar. Repeat with the green food color in the second small bowl of sugar and the yellow (gold) for the third small bowl of sugar. Set aside.Desserts 161[ ]
12. MAKE THE ICING:  Pour the powdered sugar into a small bowl, 
and whisk in the lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of water. If the 
icing is too thick, adjust the consistency with more water.
13. Place the cooled cake on a serving platter, and coat the top and sides with the icing by pouring it on evenly with a large spoon. While the icing is still fresh, sprinkle the tinted sugars in individual bands of color, 2 to 3 inches wide.
14. Cut into slices, and serve.
LAGNIAPPE TIPS: King cakes can be filled, too, with fillings like cream 
cheese, raspberry, and chocolate. If you want to add your own filling, spread it on the dough sheet after it’s coated with cinnamon sugar and before you roll it up.
To fully experience the king cake tradition, hide an uncooked bean or 
plastic baby so the lucky guest who bites into that slice will be crowned king or queen for the day.Complete Cajun Cookbook 162/P.ss09/e.ss09/c.ss09/a.ss09/n.ss09 /P.ss09/r.ss09/a.ss09/l.ss09/i.ss09/n.ss09/e.ss09/s.ss09
When the settlers came to Louisiana, they found both sugarcane and pecans in 
great numbers. One result? This beloved candy, a Southern favorite tradition-ally served around the holidays. But pecan pralines can be found year-round on store counters and specialty shops throughout the South. Use any extras to make Pecan Praline Pie (page /one.lin/seven.lin/five.lin).
PREP TIME:

COOK TIME:
30 MINUTES
MAKES 
20 PRALINES1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup packed light brown sugar½    cup heavy cream2 tablespoons unsalted butter1 ½    cups pecan halves1 teaspoon vanilla extract½    teaspoon table salt
1. In a large saucepan with a candy thermometer attached, com-
bine the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and heavy cream, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring until the sugars dissolve. Stir in the butter, pecans, vanilla extract, and salt, and continue to cook for about 20 minutes, until you reach the soft ball stage and the candy thermometer reads 234˚F.
2. Turn off the heat, and set the pan aside. Allow to cool to 220˚F. Stir the mixture until it starts to thicken.
3. Line a table or countertop with wax paper, and spoon out heaping tablespoons of the candy mixture, spacing about 4 inches apart. Allow the candy to cool completely, about 45 minutes. Serve immediately, or wrap individually in plastic wrap and store in an airtight container.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: To prevent the pralines crumbling, be sure to keep a close 
eye on the temperature; any temperature above 238˚F will make them dry and crumbly.Desserts 163/T.ss09/a.ss09/r.ss09/t.ss09/e.ss09 à /l.ss09/a.ss09 /B.ss09/o.ss09/u.ss09/i.ss09/l.ss09/l.ss09/i.ss09/e.ss09

MAKES 
16 SLICESFOR THE CAKE
8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, at 
room temperature, divided
2 ¼    cups cake flour
1 ½    cups granulated sugar1 teaspoon baking powder1 teaspoon table salt1 cup buttermilk½    cup shortening4 large egg whites2 cups shredded coconut, 
toasted (see Lagniappe Tip)FOR THE FROSTING
2 cups granulated sugar2 cups water½    teaspoon cream of tartar½    teaspoon table salt4 large egg whites2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1. TO MAKE THE CAKE:  Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Grease 2 
(9-inch) round cake pans with 2 tablespoons of butter.
2. In a large mixing bowl, sift together the cake flour, sugar, 
baking powder, and salt. Add the buttermilk, shortening, and the remaining 6 tablespoons of butter to the flour mixture, and blend well.
3. In a separate large bowl, using an electric mixer on high speed, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. (The whites on the beater will hold their shape when you lift them.) Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the batter until fully incorporated.
4. Divide the batter evenly between the 2 greased cake pans.Desserts 165[ ]
5. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until lightly browned and a cake 
tester or toothpick comes out clean. Transfer to a cooling rack and allow to cool to room temperature.
6. TO MAKE THE FROSTING:  In a saucepan with a candy thermom-
eter attached, combine the sugar, water, cream of tartar, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sugar dissolves. Continue to simmer without stirring the syrup for 15 to 20 minutes, until you reach the soft ball stage and the candy thermometer reads 234˚F.
7. Place the egg whites in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer set to high speed (make sure the beaters are clean and dry) as you slowly drizzle in the syrup. Beat until stiff peaks form; then stir in the vanilla extract.
8. To assemble the cake, place one cake layer on a decorative plate, and spread the frosting over it. Sprinkle with some toasted coconut flakes. Top with the second cake layer, and frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting. Sprinkle the remaining toasted coconut on the top and sides of the cake. This cake can be made a day ahead; just store cov-ered at room temperature.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: Toasting coconut is quite easy. Preheat the oven to 325˚F. 
Spread the 2 cups of shredded coconut evenly on a sheet pan in a thin layer. Toast in the oven for 5 minutes. Stir it well; then toast for 5 more minutes.Complete Cajun Cookbook 166/L.ss09/e.ss09/s.ss09 /O.ss09/r.ss09/e.ss09/i.ss09/l.ss09/l.ss09/e.ss09/s.ss09 /d.ss09/e.ss09 /C.ss09/o.ss09/c.ss09/h.ss09/o.ss09/n.ss09
This old Cajun country dessert recipe name means pig’s ears because of the 
shape these fritters take once cooked. The rolled dough balls are flattened and shaped with the tines of a fork, deep-fried, and served with a pecan rum syrup. But don’t limit them to dessert. These fritters are just as delicious served with coffee and eaten for breakfast.
PREP TIME:
20 MINUTES
COOK TIME:
45 MINUTES
MAKES 
12 FRITTERSFOR THE DOUGH
2 cups all-purpose flour, plus 
more for dusting
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 tablespoon granulated sugar½    teaspoon table salt½    teaspoon ground cinnamon½    cup whole milk2 large eggs, beatenFOR THE SYRUP
1 cup cane syrup½    cup spiced rum2 tablespoons unsalted butter1 quart peanut oil¾    cup chopped pecans, toasted 
(see Cherry Pineapple 
Dump Cake, Lagniappe Tip, page 170)
1. TO MAKE THE DOUGH:  In a medium bowl, mix the flour, baking 
powder, sugar, salt, and cinnamon.
2. In a separate medium bowl, whisk the milk and eggs. Make 
a well in the center of the flour mixture, and pour in the milk mixture, stirring well to form the dough.
3. Turn the dough onto a floured surface, and gently knead for a few minutes. Divide the dough into 12 balls. Roll each ball into a 4- to 5-inch circle shape about ⅛    inch thick. Set aside.
4. TO MAKE THE SYRUP : In a medium saucepan, combine the 
cane syrup, rum, and butter, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the syrup thickens. Remove from the heat and set aside.Desserts 167[ ]
5. In a heavy 6-quart stockpot or Dutch oven, heat the peanut oil 
over medium heat to a temperature of 375˚F. Make sure you have 1½    to 2 inches of oil in the pot. Set up a large sheet pan lined with several layers of paper towels near the pot.
6. One at a time, put a dough circle in the oil and place the tines of the fork in the center of the dough, twisting it to give the dough a pig-ear shape. Fry the dough on both sides until browned, about 1 minute per side. Drain the fried dough on the paper towel–lined sheet pan. Repeat with each piece of dough.
7. When ready to serve, dip each pig ear in the syrup, turning to coat evenly, transfer to a serving plate, and sprinkle with the toasted pecans.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: Deep-frying at home on the stovetop requires a 
deep-fryer thermometer, but keeping the temperature accurate is a chal-lenge because once you add food to the oil, the temperature will drop and adjusting the heat manually can involve some guesswork. If you enjoy frying, the best way to do it is with an electric countertop deep fryer that can hold up to 4 quarts of oil.Complete Cajun Cookbook 168/B.ss09/r.ss09/e.ss09/a.ss09/d.ss09 /P.ss09/u.ss09/d.ss09/d.ss09/i.ss09/n.ss09/g.ss09 /S.ss09/o.ss09/u.ss09/f.ss09/f.ss09/l.ss09é
This dish is a fixture in homes and on restaurant menus all over Louisiana. Bread 
pudding became popular with the frugal and resourceful Cajuns who always found different ways to use up their food. French bread goes stale quickly, so why not make it into a delicious dessert? Pain Perdu (page /two.lin/six.lin) is another.

SERVES 6FOR THE BREAD PUDDING
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 
divided
1 ½    cups plus 2 tablespoons 
granulated sugar, divided
6 large eggs, separated, egg 
whites chilled
4 cups dairy milk
¼    cup raisins1 teaspoon ground cinnamon1 teaspoon vanilla extract¼    teaspoon ground nutmeg¼    teaspoon table salt5 cups cubed stale French bread½    teaspoon cream of tartarFOR THE RUM SAUCE
1 ½    cups packed dark brown 
sugar
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted 
butter
½    cup heavy cream¼    cup spiced rum or dark rum1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1. MAKE THE BREAD PUDDING:  Preheat the oven to 350˚F. 
Grease the bottom and sides of a 9-by-9-inch baking pan with 
1 tablespoon of butter.
2. In the large bowl of an electric mixer, beat 1½    cups of sugar, the egg yolks, milk, raisins, cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, and salt.
3. Fold in the stale bread cubes, pressing them down into the liquid, and let them sit for 15 minutes so the bread absorbs some of the liquid.
4. Pour the bread mixture into the greased baking pan. Bake for about 35 minutes, until firm and golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool to room temperature for 45 minutes to 1 hour.Desserts 169[ ]
5. Grease 6 (1-cup) soufflé ramekins with the remaining 
1 tablespoon of butter. In the large bowl of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites at high speed until foamy. Gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar and the cream of tartar, and continue to mix on high speed until the meringue is thick and shiny, with stiff peaks.
6. Pour the cooled bread pudding into a separate large bowl, and stir until smooth. Gently fold in the meringue. Fill the greased soufflé ramekin cups, mounding about 1 inch over the top rim. Place the filled soufflé cups on a sheet pan. Bake for 25 minutes, or until lightly browned and toasted on top. While the soufflés are in the oven, make the rum sauce.
7. MAKE THE RUM SAUCE:  In a heavy medium saucepan, combine 
the brown sugar and butter, and stir over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes, until melted and smooth.
8. Stir in the heavy cream, rum, and cinnamon, reduce the heat to low, and bring to a simmer. Simmer for about 5 minutes, stir-ring occasionally, until the sauce thickens. Serve immediately by poking a hole in the top of each soufflé and then pouring about 2 tablespoons of warm rum sauce into each.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: Make sure your egg whites have no yolk in them and that 
they are cold before whipping. If the rum sauce separates, stir it vigorously with a spoon or wire whip until it forms a uniform consistency again.Complete Cajun Cookbook 170/C.ss09/h.ss09/e.ss09/r.ss09/r.ss09/y.ss09 /P.ss09/i.ss09/n.ss09/e.ss09/a.ss09/p.ss09/p.ss09/l.ss09/e.ss09 /D.ss09/u.ss09/m.ss09/p.ss09 /C.ss09/a.ss09/k.ss09/e.ss09

gelatin
18 ladyfingers1 cup heavy cream1 teaspoon powdered sugar½    teaspoon vanilla extract
1. Make a double boiler by filling a medium saucepan with 
2 inches of water and placing a medium heatproof bowl over it. (The bottom of the bowl should not touch the water.) Heat the saucepan and bowl over medium heat until steaming; add the egg yolks and beat until thick and pale yellow, about 10 minutes.
2. Gradually add the sugar while continuing to beat until the sugar is dissolved. Stir in the lemon zest and lemon juice. Con-tinue to cook for about 10 minutes, stirring constantly over the double boiler, until the sauce starts to steam a bit and thickens to a custard consistency. Turn off the heat but leave the bowl over the double boiler.
3. Pour the cool water into a small bowl and sprinkle the gela-tin over it. Let it stand for about 10 minutes, until the gelatin softens. Add the gelatin mixture to the lemon custard mixture, stirring until the gelatin is dissolved. Remove from the stove-top, and allow the custard mixture to cool completely on the kitchen countertop while you continue with the next steps.
4. In the large bowl of an electric mixer, whip the egg whites on high speed until they form stiff peaks when the beater is lifted.Desserts 177[ ]
5. Gently stir the lemon custard mixture to ensure that it has 
cooled; then fold in the beaten egg whites, creating the lemon mousse.
6. Line an 8-inch springform pan on the bottom and sides with the ladyfingers. Pour the lemon mousse into the lined spring-form pan, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.
7. In a medium bowl, whip the heavy cream with an electric mixer on high speed until frothy. Turn off the mixer and add the pow-dered sugar and vanilla extract; then whip again until the cream has formed stiff peaks.
8. When ready to serve, spoon the whipped cream over the top of the lemon mousse. To serve, run a warmed knife around the inside edge of the springform pan, and gently unlatch the side.

This is my mother’s favorite cookie recipe, and you’ll soon see why. It’s similar to 
Italian sesame cookies and traces back to the many Italian-American influences on Cajun cooking. These cookies are irresistible dipped in a warm cup of café au lait.

Created by Beulah Levy Ledner in New Orleans, this variation of the 
Hungarian-Austrian dobos torte is still popular today. Ledner eventually sold her Hungarian Jewish bakery to the famed New Orleans Gambino’s Bakery, but her recipes represent the German and Jewish influence on New Orleans cuisine in the mid-/two.lin/zero.linth century. This cake is a showstopper, frequently made from four to nine thin layers of cake separated by one (or more) flavors of filling.

3. In a small bowl, beat the 3 egg whites slightly and set aside.
4. In a separate large mixing bowl, using an electric mixer on 
medium speed, cream together the remaining 8 tablespoons of butter and the sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the 3 egg yolks, one at a time. Gradually beat in 1 cup of the flour mixture and then ½    cup of the buttermilk, alternating, until all the flour and buttermilk are blended together.
5. Add the melted chocolate, and continue beating for about 2 minutes. Fold in the beaten egg whites as well as the vanilla and almond extracts.
6. Divide the cake batter evenly between the 2 greased cake pans. Bake for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick or cake tester comes out clean. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely.
7. Cut each cake in half horizontally so you have four layers. Wrap each layer in plastic wrap; then carefully place them in the freezer to chill for about 1 hour. When ready to fill and frost the cake, remove the layers from the freezer.
8. MAKE THE FILLING:  In a medium saucepan, combine the evapo-
rated milk and chocolate, and heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate is melted.
9. In a large bowl of an electric mixer, combine the granulated sugar and cake flour.
10. While mixing on low speed with the whip attachment, slowly add the hot milk chocolate mixture to the sugar flour mixture, beating continuously until it forms a uniformly thick mixture.Desserts 183[ ]
11. Transfer the mixture back to the saucepan and stir continuously 
over medium heat until very thick. Fold in the 4 egg yolks, and continue to cook for 2 more minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and vanilla and almond extracts. It should have a custard-like consistency. Allow to cool completely.
12. Place the first layer of cake on a serving platter, then spread one-third of the filling on top. Continue stacking the layers of cake and filling, leaving the top bare.  
13. MAKE THE ICING:  In a medium saucepan with a candy thermom-
eter attached, combine the sugar, cocoa powder, corn syrup, and half-and-half, and heat over medium heat.
14. Bring the mixture to a boil, and cook until the candy thermom-eter reaches 232˚F. Remove from the heat, add the vanilla extract and butter, and stir until the butter is completely incor-porated. Allow to cool, spread over the outside and top of the cake, and serve.
LAGNIAPPE TIP: If the icing consistency gets too thick, add more half-and-
half to get it back to a spreadable texture.185/W.ss09/E.ss09/I.ss09/G.ss09/H.ss09/T.ss09 /E.ss09/Q.ss09/U.ss09/I.ss09/V.ss09/A.ss09/L.ss09/E.ss09/N.ss09/T.ss09/S.ss09
