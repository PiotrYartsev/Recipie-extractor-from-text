1 cup (235ml) goat’s milk (other 
milks can be substituted)
2 tablespoons avocado
2 tablespoons blueberry syrup1 scoop vanilla ice cream4–5 drops blue food dye1 Use the Force to blend all ingredients together. Or a blender.

Alright, you scruﬀy-looking nerf herders, this is the most well-known food in the Star Wars 
universe, which, by the way, has a marked lack of canonical food. But I couldn’t make a geeky 
cookbook without including something from Star Wars …that would just be wrong. Otherwise 
known as Bantha Milk or Tatooine Milk, this is the mysterious beverage that Luke Skywalker and his aunt and uncle are seen drinking at breakfast, right before Luke’s adventures begin in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope . The drink has appeared in countless Star Wars games, books, 
and movies since. For more Star Wars -inspired recipes, including “Wookie Cookies,” check out 
the oﬃcial cookbook. 
I know this recipe sounds a bit strange, but have you seen a Bantha? They look like a cross 
between a mammoth, a ram, and a garbage truck. I’ve seen a lot of Star Wars  fans trying to 
get their Luke Skywalker on just by adding blue food coloring to their milk. That’s great, but I wanted to take it one step further and make this beverage taste like it could actually be milk from a bizarre creature living in a galaxy far, far away. So, the goat milk gives it a sort of unusual not-the-cow-milk-we-all-know-and-love quality, and the avocado adds some additional protein and thickness. The other ingredients make it palatable—more than palatable. I think it tastes quite nice. Of course, other milks can be substituted if you’re vegan/allergic/grossed out by goats.INSPIREDBYSTARWARS

 5 Enjoy plain or with a splash of cream and/or liquor!klah
Dragonriders of Pern is a series of science-fiction novels written by Anne McCaffrey and 
occasionally her son, Todd McCaffrey. Pern is the planet on which the series takes place. Periodically, the planet is threatened by Threadfall, which is caused by another rogue planet in the solar system passing close enough to Pern to rain down destructive spores on the planet. The only creatures that can destroy the Thread are genetically engineered sentient dragons that have the ability to teleport through time and space. These dragons come in various sizes and colors and all form a psychic bond with human riders from birth. If you’re into dragons and want to see a different take on the mythical creatures, I highly recommend these books.  
If you’re not into dragons, what the hell is wrong with you? Dragons are magnificent!
So, Klah is a hot, invigorating, and spicy drink made from tree bark and is enjoyed by all 
of the Pernese. It has a pungent, spicy taste with notes of chocolate and cinnamon. It can be taken with some milk or cream, or even liquor. In the world of Pern, people are as addicted to Klah as we are to coffee. They seem to drink it at almost every meal and occasion. Honestly, I’m surprised they don’t have a Starbucks equivalent for Klah lattes and Klah frappuccinos… pumpkin spice Klah, decaf iced Klah, non-fat Klah latte with two pumps of caramel, no whip… Okay, I’m done.iNspired by drAgoNriders of perNReD PotioniNspired by vArious video gAmes

2Pour into a potion bottle and enjoy!REDPOTION
The red potion, “health potion,” or “healing potion” is a staple in video games, especially RPGs. 
It has appeared in such video-game giants as The Legend of Zelda ,World of Warcraft ,Diablo ,
Minecraft , and Ultima . Generally, the red-colored potion restores the depleted health of the 
character that consumes it. 
I considered making the potion alcoholic but it seemed to me that it would not be useful for 
Link or any other character to get sloppy in the middle of ﬁghting evil and saving the world. 
The taste and consistency of the red potion is unknown as it is rarely, if ever, discussed in any 
game. All that we know for sure is that it is generally both red and healthy. This recipe uses a 
multitude of diﬀerent fruits known for their rich vitamin content and antioxidant properties, 
as well as a little bit of ginger—which is known to ease muscle pain and acts as an anti-
inﬂammatory—to create a concoction that is very red and will certainly ﬁll up your life bar.INSPIREDBYVARIOUSVIDEOGAMES

1 tablespoon imitation butter
1 tablespoon melted butter

Harry Potter is almost universally adored. The release of The Sorcerer’s Stone  in 1997 began a 
reading revolution among young people, though Harry Potter ’s charm seems to aﬀ ect humans 
of all ages. Harry Potter changed everything, not only in literature but also in the minds of 
a generation.
Unsurprisingly, the Harry Potter  series has inspired an unfathomable amount of fan creations, 
which includes a multitude of tasty wizard treats based on what the characters eat in the books. 
There is now an oﬃ cial version of this popular Harry Potter  drink sold at Universal Studios in 
Florida. It was carefully crafted to J.K. Rowling’s speciﬁ cations and I’m sure it’s, well, magical. 
I hope to try it myself one day! However, for those of us who are unable to make it to Florida 
any time soon, it’d be nice to whip up some Butter Beer right at home. It is a little known fact 
that Butter Beer was actually a thing before Rowling ever wrote Harry Potter , or really before 
she was even born. There was a Tudor beverage known as Buttered Beere, which made its ﬁ rst 
known appearance in writing in The Good Huswifes Handmaide for the Kitchin , published in 1594. 
This recipe combines elements of this ancient Tudor drink, as well as Rowling’s butterscotch-y 
description. And it can be served hot or cold!INSPIREDBYHARRYPOTTERANDTUDORTIMES

and simmer for 15–20 minutes.
 2 Remove the spices and discard the allspice and cloves, but keep the cinnamon sticks for serving if making the hot version.
 3 Add the butter flavoring, melted butter (hot version only), vanilla extract, and sugar, and stir into the hot beer.
 4 Pour into serving glasses and stir in the evaporated milk (if using) to your taste preferences.
 5 If you’re serving the Butter Beer chilled, refrigerate the liquid until cold and then pour into a serving cup. You may need to shake it up before pouring if you add evaporated milk. Add your desired amount of soda water to your serving cup and stir.

Zelda  is a long-running Nintendo series created by Shigeru Miyamoto. The first 3-D Zelda  
game, Ocarina of Time  (where Lon Lon Milk made its first appearance), is widely considered 
to be the best game of all time. The Zelda  recipes I’ve made for my blog have been some of 
my favorite creations, and they also seem to be the most popular. Still, whenever I mention 
possibly making a recipe for Lon Lon Milk, someone always says, “Isn’t it just milk?” Boo! Boo to that. Hyrule is a magical land where ocarinas have magical powers and, you know, there are fairies and sentient trees and stuff. Did everyone forget that the cows will have a conversation with you if you play them a song? When’s the last time you had a discussion with a dairy cow? I don’t think the milk in Hyrule would be “just milk.”
Lon Lon Milk is known among Hylians for being very nutritious. When Link drinks it, it 
restores five hearts. So, I kept this one simple and healthy, but extremely tasty. There’s an apple (or apple sauce) to add a multitude of vitamins, frozen yogurt for a protein boost (which helps restore muscle tissue), and some sweet caramel to keep your spirits up. It tastes like liquid caramel apple and will legitimately boost your immune system. iNspired by the LegeNd of ZeLdA

Futurama  is an animated adult comedy TV show created by Matt Groening of The Simpsons 
fame. As the title suggests, the series takes place in the future. The main character, Philip J. 
Fry, is a present-day pizza delivery guy who becomes cryogenically frozen (by accident) and awakens in the thirty-first century. Though the series is primarily a comedy and can be absurd, it has a strong science-fiction foundation and many geeky references. In addition to appearing in Futurama ’s opening credits, Slurm is featured prominently in the episodes “Fry and the 
Slurm Factory” and “The Bots and the Bees.” 
In “Fry and the Slurm Factory” it becomes clear that Slurm is a wildly popular and addictive 
soft drink. The drink’s actual slogan is: “It’s highly addictive!” The beverage is created on the planet Wormulan, where the Futurama  crew discover that the primary ingredient is, well, really 
gross. However, Fry is so addicted that he elects not to reveal the beverage’s disgusting origins to the world in fear that Slurm will no longer be manufactured. In “The Bots and the Bees,” Fry drinks so much of the newest Slurm drink, “Slurm Loco,” that he becomes radioactive. 
It is not specifically stated what Slurm tastes like, so I made my own delicious Slurm ooze by 
combining frozen limeade with mint jelly and adding soda water for carbonation. iNspired by futurAmA

I would guess that many of us have a favorite in the vampire genre, whether it’s Dracula ,
Nosferatu ,The Vampire Chronicles ,Buﬀ y the Vampire Slayer ,True Blood , or dare I mention the “T” 
word? Vampires are so present in our fantasies that even stories that are not speciﬁ cally about 
vampires have vampire characters. Whether the vampires you subscribe to are vicious killers, 
tortured souls, infected mutants, or, you know, sparkly teenagers, they all have one thing in 
common: they drink blood to survive. 
Most of us have, at one point or another, tasted our own blood. Blood sort of tastes like a 
liquid salty penny—it’s not great. Vampires, however, seem to experience the taste of blood 
in an entirely diﬀ erent way to us mortals. My recipe looks an awful lot like the real thing 
but tastes much better to the human palate. This recipe can be combined with an energy 
drink (I suggest Red Bull) for an energizing eﬀ ect, or alcohol (vodka works) for an intoxicating 
eﬀ ect, depending on what you’re into. Happy, er, blood drinking!INSPIREDBYVAMPIRES(INGENERAL)

Most recognize A Clockwork Orange as the highly disturbing film directed by Stanley Kubrick, 
but it was actually a book first. Kubrick tended to take a book’s concept and turn it into something else entirely (The Shining ), which was part of his genius, but he didn’t always make 
friends with the esteemed authors whose work he adapted. The film version of A Clockwork Orange  was nowhere near as divergent as some of Kubrick’s other adaptations ( The Shining ), 
but it had a different tone to the book. The original novella by Anthony Burgess on which the film was based is violent, and it definitely has a point to make about the nature of morality (perhaps not the same point as the film), but it is first and foremost a dystopian science-fiction story. 
In both the book and the film, Moloko Plus is served at the Korova Milkbar. The weird 
sort of English slang/Russian that the characters all speak is called Nadsat, and “Moloko” is the Nadsat word for milk. Moloko-Plus means milk plus something else; in the book and the movie, “something else” is various drugs. In this recipe, the something else is orange-vanilla vodka, combined with a couple of other ingredients to round it out. The vodka is a tribute to the Russian influence and the orange is, well, obvious. 
It tastes like a liquified Creamsicle and will certainly sharpen you and your droogies up 
for some ultraviolence...which, hopefully, in this case is a game of Dungeons & Dragons . Or a 
knitting circle.inspired by A clockwork orAnge

Fire series, aside from, you know, regular wine. Mulled Wine is beloved by Jeor Mormont, 
Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, who likes his extra spicy with dried berries and nuts, but without lemon. He considers adding lemon “southron heresy.” Mulled Wine seems to be popular among the brothers of the Night’s Watch in general, presumably because it helps fight the extreme cold of The Wall.
Mulled Wine is a real thing, of course. There is an ancient German version called Glühwein 
and a Nordic version called Glögg, but the concept is the same: wine heated with spices and (mostly citrus) fruits. Whether you’re a brother of the Night’s Watch or you just need something to warm you up during a cold winter night, this is the perfect solution. Brewing this rich and delicious hot beverage makes your whole house smell amazing and drinking it is like taking a warm bath with scented candles…but in your mouth. inspired by A song of ice And firesPICe Beerinspired by dune

Dune , the ﬁ rst book in the series of the same name by Frank Herbert, which began in 1965, is 
the best-selling science-ﬁction novel of all time. Considered to be the most complex science-
ﬁction series ever written, it has been called the sci-ﬁ equivalent to The Lord of the Rings .
The main plotline revolves around a narcotic called Spice Melange, thought to be the most 
important substance in the Universe. Not like any old drug, Spice Melange grants its users 
a longer lifespan, heightened awareness, and, occasionally, clairvoyance. The substance only 
exists on one planet in the known universe, Arrakis, which is also known as Dune. This is a 
hostile desert planet inhabited by giant worms, and in the series, having control of this planet 
is tantamount to having control of the Universe. 
Spice Melange is supposed to taste a bit like cinnamon and is often used in food and drink, 
including Spice Beer! In the ﬁrst book, Spice Beer is the weakness of Duncan Idaho, a much-
beloved character in the series, who describes it as the “bes’ damn stuﬀ  ever tas’ed.” This 
recipe combines your favorite light beer with delicious cinnamon-spice syrup and a shot of 
Goldschläger for good measure. You’ll have blue eyes in no time. THE SPICE MUST FLOW.INSPIREDBYDUNE

We geeks tend to be purists, but I think it’s safe to say that this is one of those rare instances 
when a remake absolutely improved upon the original. In the new version of this classic 
science-ﬁction series, the Cylons, a race of androids that we (humans) created to be our slaves 
and who ﬁnally left us alone after years of war and rebellion, come back and destroy 99 percent 
of all humanity. When humans had last seen the Cylons they looked like scary robots, but when 
they return they are indistinguishable from humans. They could be anyone. The remade series 
is powerful, moving, and full of conﬂ icting feelings, moral dilemmas, and dynamic characters. 
The series is loaded with heavy ancient-Greek themes, which may be why the most popular 
alcoholic beverage is called Ambrosia. In Greek mythology, Ambrosia was the name of the 
food or nectar of the gods. In BSG, Ambrosia seems to be a very bright green version of wine. 
Some assume it is absinthe because of the green color, but it is used much more like wine 
or champagne. However, the drink does seem to be more potent than either the wine or 
champagne of Earth. 
This recipe combines sparkling wine with pear vodka and elderﬂ ower liqueur to create 
a nectar-like wine that is potent but easy to drink. Human or toaster, I think you’ll have a 
fracking good time drinking this. So say we all!INSPIREDBYBATTLESTARGALACTICA

Stephen King is often acknowledged as a master of horror with classics like Carrie  and  
The Shining , but some may not realize that he also created an epic fantasy series. Reading  
The Dark Tower  may make you question the nature of the universe, change the way you talk, 
and possibly make you wish you lived in Maine. One of the many mind-blowing things about 
the series is that it ties together everything Stephen King has ever written. So, if you don’t think The Stand  has anything to do with Salem’s Lot , you’re wrong and you’ve forgotten the 
face of your father. 
Graf is something people drink in In-World and Mid-World. It is similar to a hard cider 
or apple beer. It’s supposed to be very refreshing and is consumed in great quantities near reaping time. I know a lot of Tower  junkies have brewed their very own approximation of the 
drink, but I wanted to make more of a cocktail version, so no one has to break out the yeast and become a brewmaster to enjoy some Graf on this level of the tower. Drink some of this  
to wash down that Gunslinger Burrito or delicious Tooter Fish Popkin! You’ll be pleased with the result—I’ll set my watch and warrant on it.inspired by the dArk tower

Not only is this game backed up by a solid science-ﬁction universe, BioWare’s Mass Eﬀ ect
series has pushed the envelope of storytelling in video games. In Mass Eﬀ ect 2 , you resume 
your role as Shepard, who is now a war hero because of the events of the ﬁrst game, and you 
are given command of the starship Normandy SR-2 , a rebuilt and improved version of the SSV 
Normandy . The catch is that you are also now working for the enemy. As Shepard, you have to 
make many hard choices—like what to sacriﬁce, who to save, whether to buy a space hamster, 
and, most importantly, who to get busy with. Food and drink are not a big part of the game, 
but there are some minor references throughout.
Serrice Ice Brandy is part of a simple side quest that is totally optional but deﬁnitely worth 
completing. Dr. Chakwas, a stately sort of woman who was part of the original Normandy
crew, also ends up serving on the new  Normandy . You are able to ask your crew members if 
they need anything, and what Dr. Chakwas needs is some Serrice Ice Brandy. If you succeed 
in ﬁnding some for her, she’ll do you the honor of drinking it with you. You’ll both get a little 
lubricated and you’ll see a diﬀerent side of the good doctor. 
The brandy is blue in color and is served in the red-rimmed tumblers that seem to be 
everywhere in the galaxy.INSPIREDBYMASSEFFECT2

Okay, I know I said earlier that Link should not drink alcohol because he could get sloppy, 
but this is the exception. This recipe is one of my favorites from the blog because it is simple 
yet addictive. Chateau Romani made its ﬁ rst and only appearance in what many consider to 
be the dark horse of the Zelda  series, Majora’s Mask .Majora’s Mask  used to be an undervalued 
game in the series but has recently gained in recognition. I think this surge in popularity is 
well deserved; the game is among my all-time favorites in any series. I have spent countless 
hours following around the people of Clock Town, learning their secrets and fears, but one of 
my favorite quest-lines involves a certain magical milk beverage.
Chateau Romani is a special kind of milk produced at Romani Ranch. The ranch is located 
outside of Clock Town and owned by two adorable red-headed sisters who bear a strong 
resemblance to Malon from Ocarina of Time . Chateau Romani is exceptionally pricey, costing 
a whopping two hundred rupees per bottle. It’s also diﬃ cult to obtain as it is only sold in 
the exclusive Milk Bar inside East Clock Town. In the game, you need to complete several 
diﬀ erent quests in order to get a bottle of Chateau Romani (including saving some very special 
cows from alien abduction), but it is absolutely worth the trouble. Chateau Romani will fully 
replenish your heart bar, as well as give you unlimited magic, although it might make you a 
bit tipsy, like a certain mustachioed circus leader seen moping around in the Milk Bar during 
their open hours.INSPIREDBYTHELEGENDOFZELDA

 2 Partially melt the ice cream in a microwave-safe container—you don't want the ice cream to be completely liquid, so make sure there are still some frozen lumps. 
 3 If you want to add cinnamon and/or nutmeg, now is the time: 
mix it into the ice cream itself because the fat from the cream will 
prevent the spices from clumping. Stir the ice cream so it's smooth 
and lump-free and all the spices are thoroughly mixed in. 
 4 Add the ice cream to your serving cup. Pour in the Irish cream, 
then the milk, followed by the soda water. Stir. Note: This drink is not a precise science; levels of each ingredient can be adjusted to fit your individual tastes. So if you wanna add a little more Irish cream in that sucker… Enjoy!CHAteAu rOMAnIinspired by the legend of zeldA

Fellow Browncoats, let’s have a moment of silence for Fireﬂ y .
The cancellation of Fireﬂ y  was one of the most devastating losses in geek television. Sadly, 
after only ﬁ fteen magniﬁ cent episodes, it was taken oﬀ  the air. Fireﬂ y  was a sci-ﬁ western 
fusion, created by Joss Whedon. Set about ﬁ ve hundred years in the future, after humans had 
just arrived in a new star system, the series had a sort of a futuristic Wild West atmosphere 
and took “the ﬁ nal frontier” very literally. The story followed a group of nine renegades, all 
with very diverse backgrounds, struggling to survive on a Fireﬂy-class starship. Let’s keep the 
memory of Fireﬂ y  alive with some good ol’ Mudder’s Milk!
Mudder’s Milk appeared in the episode “Jaynestown.” It was used on a remote planet called 
Higgin’s Moon to simultaneously feed the laborers, or Mudders (as mud was the planet’s only 
export), and keep them submissive. It has, according to planetary legend Jayne, “all the protein, 
vitamins, and carbs of your grandma’s best turkey dinner, plus 15 percent alcohol.” From this 
description, I imagined it being a sort of alcoholic protein shake. This recipe is not going to 
be everyone’s cup of companion tea but that’s how it is supposed to be. I think it tastes pretty 
rutting good myself. It would be a great meal replacement for one of those days. Fun fact: As a 
shout out to Fireﬂ y , Mudder’s Milk was added as a consumable item in World of Warcraft .INSPIREDBYFIREFLY

Douglas Adams’ hilarious sci-fi series is legendary. The story began in 1978 as a BBC radio 
show, and then it became a critically acclaimed series of books. Since then there has been a full-length movie, multiple comics, video games, and countless other adaptations of the beloved series. It has been referenced in everything from Doctor Who  to the Google search 
page. The prominent theme is The Guide , which is sort of a travel guide for the Milky Way 
Galaxy complete with hot tips and dire warnings. The Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, described in The Guide  as the best drink in existence, was invented by Zaphod Beeblebrox—the flamboyant, 
two-headed anti-hero of the series. 
As Adams has stated, a true and authentic PGGB cannot be made on Earth, as the laws  
of physics prevent it; however, I thought I’d try my hand at making something relatively close. I might not always know where my towel is but, I assure you, this drink is both expensive and bad for the head. Ol’ Janx Spirit is substituted with rum because rum is one of the few Earth spirits that is made from juice. Santraginean seawater is now sparkling water. Arcturan Mega-Gin cubes are a combination of ice cubes and Bombay Sapphire. The bubbling effect of Fallian Marsh Gas was already taken care of with the carbon dioxide gas in the sparkling water, but I approximated the flavor of it to be like that of limoncello, as the drink is supposed to have a…lemon-y effect. Qualactin Hypermint extract? Easy, mint extract. Tooth of an Algolian Suntiger is a sugar cube with pepper vodka to add heat. Mysterious Zamphour is lemon-flavored sugar because, you know, it sprinkles. The olive is pretty self explanatory. 
The final result is like a spicy, lightly sweet, lemon martini. It seems mostly harmless while 
you’re drinking it, but it will lay you out so much, you’ll think you were, well, hit in the head by a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick.inspired by the hitchhiker’s guide to the gAlAxyBlAster

The Lord of the Rings  is the single most inﬂ uential fantasy series of all time. Like many nerds, it 
was my ﬁ rst epic fantasy love. I want to do right by Lord of the Rings  fans everywhere, especially 
the fans who occupied the AOL Lord of the Rings  chatrooms in the early 2000s. Hi, guys! 
Remember me? I’m the one who never said anything and just hung around like a creep. 
Miruvor is the cordial beverage of Rivendell. In The Fellowship of the Ring , a ﬂ ask of Miruvor 
is given to Gandalf by Elrond after the ﬁ rst council and helps the Fellowship survive the very 
nippy trip to Moria. Miruvor is known for its warming and rejuvenating qualities. The word 
comes from the Quenya Lexicon and means “drink of the Valar.” It is described as a clear liquid 
with a pleasant fragrance. It was a bit challenging to create a drink based on these facts, but 
I hope you’ll enjoy this lovely ethereal beverage. The white tea is hot and invigorating, the 
elderﬂower liqueur and rose water add a ﬂoral quality, and the peach schnapps adds a nectar-
like sweetness. The end result is somehow both soothing and energizing. Visually, it is mostly 
clear but has a light golden shine which I think adds a bit of elven magic.INSPIREDBYTHELORDOFTHERINGS

Star Trek is the most popular science-ﬁction creation of all time. If you’re about to say anything 
or even think anything about Star Wars  right now: shhh, stop. Star Wars  is not hard science 
ﬁction, it’s a space opera. Okay, yes, technically space opera is a sub-genre of science ﬁction, 
but still, it’s like comparing GWAR to Fleetwood Mac. I’m not implying that either is better 
than the other, just that they are not comparable. 
Now that that’s out of the way, let’s talk Romulan Ale. This alcoholic drink made an 
appearance as far back as the original series and was even in the classic Star Trek  ﬁlm The 
Wrath of Khan . Romulan Ale has a characteristic bright blue color, though the shade of blue 
does vary throughout the series. Little is known about the taste of the drink, but what is 
known is that it’s extremely potent and causes some killer hangovers. Romulans are sort 
of reoccurring “villains” in Star Trek —they have never really been on good terms with The 
Federation—so Romulan Ale is illegal…though its outlaw status might also have something 
to with the hangovers. What I created is bright blue and tastes kinda like a chocolate orange. 
It has a nice sweet-and-sour thing going on, just like the Romulans. It’s also really easy to 
drink. I hope you enjoy it, because you won’t enjoy it so much tomorrow!INSPIREDBYSTARTREK

Mead is present in many, many geeky things. It has featured in books by such literary giants 
as J. R. R. Tolkien, George R. R. Martin, and Neil Gaiman. It is especially present in tales of Germanic influence—anything involving Vikings or the Norse pantheon, such as Beowulf , 
Skyrim , and the Thor comics. In Norse mythology, Mead is served in Valhalla, which is sort of 
like Viking heaven, and the home of the Norse all-father god, Odin. 
Food historians have mostly been in consensus that Mead was the first alcoholic beverage 
ever created. So, what is it? Mead is a type of wine fermented from honey instead of grapes and frequently flavored with fruits and spices. It generally has a light golden color. 
Here’s the thing: A proper Mead takes weeks or even months to come of age and requires 
a good amount of expensive wine-making and fermentation supplies to boot. Sure, there are quick and dirty ways to make a sort of mead hooch, but I wouldn’t want to attempt it. There are plenty of wonderful recipes out there if you think you want to take on alcohol-making from scratch, but I can’t be your guide on that journey because, frankly, I wouldn’t know what I was talking about. 
So here is my recipe for a Mead cocktail—made with wine, honey, fruit essences, and 
spices. Put on your helm and faux furs and drink like a Viking! To Valhalla!miscellAneous geek

(Text)GROG
Monkey Island  was the ﬁ rst video game I fell in love with. With a lot of trial and error and the 
help of my big brother, I managed to play the game before I could even read. The Secret of 
Monkey Island  is beautiful, challenging, and hilarious. It follows the adventures of an aspiring 
pirate named Guybrush Threepwood as he gets in over his head with piranha poodles, ghost 
pirates, and health-conscious cannibals. At the beginning of the game, you are told how to 
become a pirate (because in  Monkey Island  becoming a pirate is sort of like a club or fraternity 
and there are certain hazing rituals you must overcome) and, in addition to treasure hunting, 
sword ﬁ ghting, and thievery, there is one other requirement to being considered a true pirate: 
Grog-swilling! 
The ingredients of Grog listed in Monkey Island  are not true to life. They’re also not 
appealing or safe in any way. Seriously, the only acids that should be in your grog are ascorbic 
and citric. Grog is a real drink that was invented by the English Royal Navy for the very 
practical purposes of watering down the alcohol rations that were given to sailors. This was 
done because it was common for sailors to save up their rum rations for the purposes of 
getting totally and completely drunk, which was very problematic. So, originally, Grog was 
just watered-down rum, but it evolved over time to include fruit juices, sweeteners, and spices. 
The pirate version of Grog is actually called Bumbo and was considerably more elaborate 
than the naval version. My take on the drink is a delicious punch with honey, cinnamon, 
and both tropical and citrus juices. With all of the vitamin C in this drink, you’ll be unlikely 
to get scurvy!INSPIREDBYMONKEYISLANDAND

For the dough
1 cup or 2 sticks (225g)  
butter, divided
2 cups (240g) flour
Ice water
For the filling
¾ cup (110g) raisins¼ cup (35g) dried figs, 
chopped
½ cup (120ml) orange juice¼ cup (60ml) honey, or  
to taste
1 teaspoon orange zest1 teaspoon allspice1 teaspoon ground cinnamonPinch of ground ginger 1 In a large mixing bowl, add the flour with ¾ cup or 1½ sticks (170g) 
of the butter. Using your fingers, work the butter into the flour until you have a crumbly texture. Add a tiny amount of ice water to the flour and butter and combine until the dough is very stiff.
 2 Cover the dough and place in the fridge while you make the filling. 
 3 Put the raisins, figs, orange juice, honey, zest, spices, and the remaining ¼ cup or ½ stick (57g) of butter into a saucepan and simmer for 10–15 minutes. If any liquid remains, discard it. Leave to cool.
 4 Preheat the oven to 375
°F (190°C). Divide the dough into nine even 
pieces. Roll out each piece until it is ¹⁄8 inch (3 mm) thick, then use a 
tea saucer as a template and cut around it with a knife.
 5 Spoon about a tablespoon of the filling into the center of the circle, then pull the dough edges into the center of the circle over the filling and press together. Note: Wet your fingers slightly with cold milk or water when doing this to ensure the edges seal.
 6 When sealed, use your hands or a roller to flatten the Figgin a bit.
 7 Flip the Figgin over so that the sealed side is on the bottom. Cut slits into the center to vent.
 8 Place the Figgin, sealed side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
 9 Repeat steps 6–9 until you have nine Figgins on the baking sheet.
 10 Bake for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.Figgins
Terry Pratchett’s wacky and hilarious series contains a lot of edible things, though many are 
not entirely appealing. Pig’s ear soup, anyone? How about some rat fruit? No? But if you’re a Discworld  fan, I highly recommend purchasing Nanny Ogg’s Cookbook . 
Other than a mysterious word for an unknown body part from which one would not want 
to be hung, a Figgin is defined in Guards! Guards!  as a shortcrust pastry containing raisins or, 
alternately, in Interesting Times  as a small bun with currants in it. I made a Guards! Guards!  
version. I also included figs, because, you know, FIG-gins. inspired by discworld

In another bowl, combine the gelatin and water, stir, and set

 3 Add all the other ingredients to the panko and buttermilk in 
the large mixing bowl and tip in the gelatin and its water. Mix everything together thoroughly. 
 4 Line a loaf tin with parchment paper and pour in the Spoo, smoothing the top.
 5 Bake for 45 minutes, or until the center of the Spoo reaches at least 165°F (75°C). This is very important! There is poultry in this dish, which is dangerous to consume raw. 
 6 Remove the Spoo from the oven and leave to cool and set for about 10 minutes. There will probably be a brown layer on top that will be removed later for aesthetic reasons, and a good amount of juice will escape and look very gross, but, trust me, it will taste good.
 7 Use a knife to cut the loaf into cubes, removing the browned top  
from each, and serve! I like to skewer my chunks onto little toothpicks.spoo
Babylon 5  is a space-opera series that ran for five years in the 1990s. The series features a good 
amount of strange alien foods, but the most intriguing (and perhaps the most disgusting) is Spoo. 
Spoo (“Oops” spelled backwards) actually makes its first appearance before Babylon 5 , in S he-Ra: 
Princess of Power , where it is offered to Skeletor, who quickly rejects it saying that he hates Spoo, 
even though he doesn’t know what it is.
Spoo is made from a type of worm of the same name that is treated with contempt by most of 
the galaxy due to its annoying habit of sighing all the time. It is considered by many aliens to be the tastiest food in the galaxy; however, it doesn’t seem to appeal to human tastes. Or Skeletor’s.inspired by babylon 5CRam inspired by The lord of The rings

I get a surprising amount of requests for Cram, the characteristically unexciting biscuit-like 
food from The Lord of the Rings , which is testament to the dedication for which Tolkien fans are 
renowned. Cram is so unexciting that in The Hobbit  Tolkien describes eating it as a “chewing 
exercise.” Its few redeeming qualities are that it is so dry that it keeps indeﬁnitely and that it 
provides adequate sustenance. This food is not to be confused with Cram from Fallout , which 
is a play on the canned mystery meat that is Spam.
This recipe is for a very dry cookie or biscuit that has protein powder added for sustenance 
and apple sauce for extra nutrients. Additional sugar and apple sauce (1 to 2 tablespoons) can 
be added to make the biscuit less dry and bland if you’re more concerned with taste than you 
are with accuracy. Enjoy?INSPIREDBYTHELORDOFTHERINGS

Fish Fingers and Custard became a thing when the eleventh incarnation of the Doctor ﬁ rst 
regenerated outside of the home of a young Amelia Pond. His regeneration made him very 
hungry but, having a whole new body, he had no idea what sort of food tasted good to his new 
taste buds. So he enlisted the help of his new red-headed pal to help him ﬁnd out what he 
liked. After rejecting a multitude of diﬀ erent foods, he found something that he liked. Yep, ﬁ sh 
ﬁ ngers dipped in custard. 
Let’s face it, the idea is meant to be sort of strange and unappealing. In the scene, Matt 
Smith himself is actually eating breaded coconut cakes dipped in custard. Since making the 
recipe, though, a lot of Whovians have told me that plain old store-bought ﬁsh ﬁngers and 
regular vanilla custard actually taste pretty okay. I’ll take their word for it and bless them all 
for their dedication…but I wanted to make something that everyone could get down with. 
My recipe pairs a panko- and coconut-battered fried ﬁsh ﬁnger (coconut added as tribute 
to the reality of the scene) and tangy lemon and honey mustard dipping sauce (that basically 
looks like custard) which complements it perfectly.INSPIREDBYDOCTORWHO

 2 In a medium mixing bowl, mix together 1 cup (125g) of the flour with the panko and seasonings. Put the remaining flour in a separate small shallow bowl.
 3 Prepare a deep fryer–if you don’t have one, fill a heavy-bottomed pot three-quarters full of canola oil. Heat the oil to 370°F (190°C).
 4 If you have a fry basket, set it into the pot full of oil or deep fryer. Make sure it is dry before doing so.
 5 Remove shrimp from the buttermilk bath and roll in the plain flour until coated. Then, dunk back into the buttermilk/egg bath, remove again and roll into the panko/flour mix until coated. Repeat this for every shrimp. This can be done in batches of 5 or 6 shrimp; you want to fry them in batches of this size because adding too many at once can cause safety issues and reduce the temperature of the oil, which will make the batter soggy.
 6 Drop one batch of shrimp into the deep fryer at a time. Remove by carefully lifting the fry basket out of the pot or deep fryer after one or two minutes or when the shrimp are golden and crispy. If you do not have a fry basket, use tongs to remove the shrimp. Be very careful not to get splashed with hot oil! Repeat until all Popplers are fried.

(Text)ELSWEYRFONDUE
The Elder Scrolls  is a video-game series that is chock-full of delicious-sounding made-up 
foods, and it was diﬃcult to pin down just the right one to put in this collection. As I have 
a weakness for cheese, this one stood out. In the world of Elder Scrolls , Elsweyr is the home 
of the Khajiit race, which you may recognize as the big humanoid kitties. Elsweyr Fondue is 
made with three ingredients: Ale, Eidar cheese, and Moon Sugar. When eaten, it restores a 
massive amount of magicka. 
So, Eidar cheese is very obviously a blue cheese and ale is pretty self-explanatory, but the 
Moon Sugar is a bit of a question mark. Moon Sugar is an alchemy ingredient in the game that 
restores magicka, and is also used in the creation of Skooma, an illegal substance. It looks like 
brown crystals and is said to be made from a cane plant, like regular sugar. It is known to have 
a narcotic eﬀect, especially on Khajiit, so that reminded me a little of catnip. Though we all 
love watching our cats act like furry little fools when exposed to the substance, catnip is not 
something that humans often consume, except, occasionally, as a mildly tranquilizing tea. So I 
made a catnip tea–infused hard candy (for a crystalized look) and added some mesquite ﬂavor. 
Admittedly, the Moon Sugar tastes pretty strange by itself but adds a nice smoky sweetness 
to the fondue. You will deﬁnitely have more Moon Sugar than you need for the fondue (the 
nature of hard candy makes it impossible to make in small batches), so alternatively, if you 
don’t want to end up with a bunch of extra Moon Sugar, you can skip making it all together 
and just add a pinch of mesquite and regular sugar to the fondue.
Enjoy the fondue with an assortment of veggies, fruits, bread, and meats. Hot tip: It goes 
especially well with steamed broccoli, apples, crusty bread, and tangy/spicy meats. Sugar and 
sand, furlicker! INSPIREDBYTHEELDERSCROLLS

For the moon sugar 
(optional)
½ cup (120ml) water
3 catnip tea bags¹⁄³ cup (78ml) corn syrup
2 tablespoons mesquite 
flavor
2 teaspoons cayenne 
powder, or to taste
1 tablespoon smoked 
paprika, or to taste
1 cup (200g) granulated 
sugar
Confectioners’ sugar,  
for coating
For the fondue 
1 clove garlic2 tablespoons butter½ cup (120ml) ale1¾ cups or 8 ounces (225g) 
crumbled blue cheese  (your choice)
¾ cup or 6 ounces (175g) 
cream cheese
2 pieces Moon Sugar, optionalBite-sized pieces of your 
favorite fruits, veggies, breads, and meats, for dipping 1 First make the Moon Sugar. Boil the water and brew the 3 tea bags 
for about 10–15 minutes until a strong concentrate is made. Remove the tea bags, squeezing out any excess liquid, and discard.
 2 Pour the brewed catnip tea into a good-quality metal saucepan with a candy thermometer attached along with the corn syrup, spices, and sugar. 
 3 Heat the mixture until it reaches 300°F (150°C), stirring constantly. 
 4 Transfer the mixture to a heat-resistant container lined with parchment paper and sprinkle the confectioners’ sugar over the top. Let the candy cool and harden.
 5 When the candy is hard, use a butter knife to break it into pieces roughly the size of Jolly Ranchers. Coat with more confectioners’ sugar if desired. The end product should look a bit like sea glass. You will have much more than needed for the Fondue, so you can either discard the excess or crush it up and use it as a rub for meat.
 6 Next, make the Fondue. Cut the garlic clove in half and rub the cut sides around the inside of a fondue pot. When done, leave the garlic in the pot.
 7 Add the butter to the pot and turn the heat on the fondue machine  to 200°F (95°C). Let the butter melt for a few seconds.
 8 Pour the ale into the pot.
 9 Begin to slowly add the crumbled blue cheese to the ale and stir in.
 10 When the cheese starts to melt, add the cream cheese and stir 
until the Fondue is smooth. 
 11 Add the Moon Sugar and stir for about a minute more. The Moon Sugar will melt gradually and infuse the Fondue with a sweet, smoky flavor, but it will not melt completely right away.
 12 Dip the sides of your choice into the fondue and enjoy!

¾ cup (88g) shredded Gruyère 
cheese, divided
½ cup (120ml) warm milk½ cup (120ml) warm water1½ tablespoons olive oilButter, vegetable oil, or 
nonstick spray, for greasing
3 tablespoons butter, melted 1 Combine 1½ cups (180g) flour, the sugar, salt, and the yeast in a 
large mixing bowl and thoroughly mix. 
 2 Toss in ½ cup (58g) of each cheese, add the warm milk, warm water, and the olive oil, and beat for about 2 minutes. 
 3 Gradually stir in the rest of the flour until you have a soft dough. 
 4 Tip out the dough onto a floured board and knead until it is elastic and not sticky, adding more flour if necessary. 
 5 Place in a greased bowl and then flip the dough over to grease the other side. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm environment for approximately 30 minutes. 
 6 Punch the dough down, cover again, and let rest for 10 more minutes. 
 7 Cut the dough into 20 pieces and shape each one into a sphere. 
 8 Dip each ball in melted butter and arrange the balls in two rows in the pan. Cover with a paper towel. Leave to rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until the balls have almost reached the top of the pan. Cheese Buns
The Hunger Games  seems to be really polarizing amongst nerds. There are some who seem to 
hate it and many more who love it. It might be because the story is often compared to (and even 
accused of copying) Battle Royale . Personally, having read and watched both of these, I think 
they are completely different stories. And, let’s face it, pitting people (even children) against each other in a fight to the death is hardly a new concept. I don’t think either is better than the other, but there is one way in which The Hunger Games  excels over Battle Royale : food! 
There are a lot of mouthwatering food moments in The Hunger Games. A lot. The moments 
are extra delicious as you experience them from the perspective of a character who has been malnourished most of her life. One of the more memorable foods is Katniss’ favorite baked good from Peeta’s bakery: the Cheese Bun. They are described as buns baked with a layer of cheese on top. Seriously, who doesn’t like bread and cheese? Carb + melted cheese = heaven, amiright? inspired by The hunger games

 9 Preheat your oven to 375ºF (190°C) and grease a small pan.
 10 Sprinkle the remaining cheeses over the rolls. 
 11 Bake on the lower rack of the oven for about 35 minutes, or until the rolls are firm and golden.  
You can tell they’re done when you insert a toothpick and it comes out clean. Allow to cool for  5 minutes, then enjoy.

Lembas is the quintessential geeky fictional food. It made its first appearance in Tolkien’s The 
Fellowship of the Ring . The flavor of Lembas is never detailed but it is said to be able to fill the belly 
of a grown man in a few bites, which makes it useful for long journeys. It’s also supposed to taste more pleasant than it’s non-elvish counterpart, Cram (see page 45). If it were not for Lembas, Frodo and Sam would probably not have survived the extremely perilous journey through Mordor. 
This is my second variation on Lembas. The nuts and the protein powder make it extremely 
filling; they will definitely make you feel like you just ate a big dinner. The citrus zest adds vitamins and the honey makes the bread both fragrant and tasty. They are soft, lightly sweet, and very delicate, so it’s somewhat of a surprise when you start to feel like you just ate Thanksgiving dinner. I recently took some with me on a hiking excursion. I pretended I was climbing Mount Doom and kept calling my fiancé “Mr. Frodo.” He didn’t appreciate it, but the Lembas definitely kept my energy up.inspired by The lord of The rings

 3 Add the flour and combine to form the dough. If desired, add a few drops of each food coloring into the dough and work it in evenly.
 4 Chill the dough in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
 5 Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place a sheet of wax paper on top of a flat surface and, working in batches, place a handful of dough on the wax paper and then place another sheet of wax paper on top. The wax paper will prevent sticking.
 6 Use a pastry roller or rolling pin to roll out the dough until it’s about ¹⁄
8 inch (3 mm) thick.
 7 Remove the top sheet of wax paper and use a square cookie cutter, about 3 × 3 inches (7.5 × 7.5 cm) in size, to shape the crackers, setting aside the excess dough to re-roll for the next batch. soyLenT gReen
Soylent Green  is a dystopian classic. It takes place on a future Earth where almost all of the world’s 
resources have been depleted due to the sheer number of humans occupying the planet. Most 
of the overwhelming population survives, barely, on rations. Soylent Green is the newest of these rations. It is supposedly made from “high-energy plankton” and is much more nutritious than its predecessors, Soylent Red and Yellow. 
Soylent Green appears in the movie as an unremarkable green-colored square. The taste is 
not described, though it is supposedly tastier than both Red and Yellow. Most people nowadays know the big “secret” of Soylent Green before they even watch the movie. Charlton Heston’s dramatic acting at the film’s climax is just too much fun to imitate. *SPOILER ALERT* I skipped the people (OMG, people!) and made a delicious cracker using furikake as the “high-energy plankton,” cuz, you know, oceans. Turns out that people (and/or high-energy plankton) tastes pretty great dipped in hummus! I know, I know, everything tastes great dipped in hummus.inspired by soylenT green

Not that anything could ever make the cancellation of Firefly  okay, but there was, in fact, a 
movie that dulled a minuscule portion of the grief and suffering. Serenity  takes place a few 
months after where Firefly  left off, and follows the crew of Serenity  as they try to keep escaped 
experiment subject River Tam hidden from The Alliance.
In the film, there is a humorously bizarre commercial for a product called Fruity Oaty Bars 
that actually carries a subliminal signal to seek out River Tam. The bar itself seems to be rainbow 
colored (though that might just be the wrapper) and presumably tastes of fruit and oats. So I made a super tasty baked goody with oatmeal and dried fruits. Warning: Your mind will be blown and a live octopus might come out of your blouse. Also, keep out of reach of mice. Make a batch of these and pass them around your Firefly  support group!inspired by sereniTy

Earthbound  is a fun and quirky old-school RPG, sort of a mix of a children’s television show 
and a stoner’s sci-fi dream fantasy. It also has a really interesting and complex food system, 
which makes it my kind of game. It was a little difficult to decide which food to include here because there are so many interesting options. For me, and I don’t think I’m alone in this, the Peanut Cheese Bar has always stood out the most. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your perspective), Trout Yogurt and Piggy Jelly didn’t make the cut. 
The Peanut Cheese Bar is the favorite food of the lovable species Mr. Saturn. Besides 
containing both peanuts and cheese, little is known about the bars other than that they are supposed to taste “pretty yummy” and recover 100 HP. If you’re the kind of person who loves to combine salty and sweet, you will love this recipe. I didn’t want to shy away from getting a real cheesy flavor, so I used sharp cheddar, but a milder cheese can be used instead. ZOOM!inspired by earThbound

sear the lamb until it gets a good color and doesn’t burn.
2Sauté the onions and garlic in the remaining olive oil over a 
medium-high heat until the onions become translucent and soft. 
Then add the chopped carrots and celery and sauté for another 
7 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to soften.
3Add all the remaining ingredients except the pistachios and wild 
rice to a soup pot or Dutch oven and stir together, making sure 
everything is evenly incorporated.
4Simmer for at least 2 hours, or until the lamb is tender and falling 
oﬀ  the bone. You will need to periodically check on it, stir, taste, 
and adjust the spices, if necessary.
5When done, remove the bones from the stew and discard. Break 
up the pieces of lamb with a spoon. 
6Serve over a bed of cooked wild rice.LAMBSTEWWITHPLUMS
This is heroine Katniss Everdeen’s favorite food from The Capitol and it is an absolutely essential 
geeky food. In the ﬁ rst book, Katniss describes this stew as “incredible” and even tells Hunger 
Games host Caesar Flickman that it’s what she ﬁ nds most impressive in The Capitol. I’m with you 
100 percent, Katniss. Food FTW. Later in the book, when Katniss and Peeta are slowly starving in a 
cave, Haymitch sends them a parcel of the stew. The speciﬁ c ﬂ avors of the stew are not described. 
All that is known is that it contains lamb and dried plums and is sometimes served over wild rice, 
a combination that Katniss ﬁ nds “perfect.” Not to toot my own horn (toot! toot!), but my version 
is absolutely delicious and is the perfect meal after a long day of terror and ﬁ ghting for your life.INSPIREDBYTHEHUNGERGAMES

There are many, many mouthwatering descriptions of food in George R. R. Martin’s epic 
tale, and one might wonder why I chose the questionable back-alley concoction of King’s Landing’s poorest folk (that phrase works two ways!) to put in this collection. I’m not sure why, but I think most would agree that it’s one of the more memorable dishes in the series. It might be the mystery of what’s inside, which frequently includes rats, pigeons, and possibly, in some of the more dubious pot shops, a very unfortunate person. Of course, there are also turnips, barley, carrots, and other humble vegetables. Arya Stark was prone to wolfing down (pun not intended, but I’m happy with it) a nice Bowl o’ Brown during her time as a street urchin in King’s Landing.
This recipe is definitely flexible; pretty much anything can be added to it. I recommend 
choosing at least three different kinds of cheap meat that you’re not entirely comfortable with, because what’s a ASoIaF /Game of Thrones recipe without a little discomfort? I used chicken 
legs, pork chump end, and oxtail and it turned out pretty fantastic. Of course, no meat is turned down, so if that one person that drives you up the wall were to suddenly disappear…

 1 Season the meat with salt and pepper and brown in 3 tablespoons of the butter. Add the browned 
meat to a slow cooker.
 2 In the same pan in which you browned the meat, add the rest of the butter, onions, and garlic and sauté until the onions start to soften and turn translucent. 
 3 Add the mushrooms and continue to sauté for a couple minutes.
 4 Finally, add the turnips, potato, and carrots, and sauté for 5 minutes.
 5 Add the sautéed veggies to the slow cooker, then add the beef broth, ale, Worcestershire sauce, barley, bay leaf, salt and pepper, and any other seasonings you want to use.
 6 Cook for at least 4 hours on a high heat setting on a slow cooker. 
 7 Sprinkle a bit of flour into the soup and stir in—this will help thicken it—gradually adding more until you get the desired thickness.
 8 Adjust the heat to low and cook for a couple more hours, or until the meat is tender. It gets better the longer it stews!

You can probably see that I like Zelda  a lot, as it has inspired many of the recipes in this book. So 
far, Elixir Soup has only appeared in one Zelda  game, The Windwaker. The Windwaker is a bit of an 
underdog in the series because it is stylistically simple in comparison to the critically acclaimed 
and much-beloved Ocarina of Time . 
Link receives this soup from his adorable grandmother after healing her illness with 
a captured fairy. The soup is bright yellow and is described as both healthy and hearty—it fully replenishes Link’s life and magic bar and doubles his attack power! I can see why it’s his favorite. And unlike other potions in the game, Link smiles when he drinks this.inspired by The LeGend of ZeLda

As mentioned in the foreword, this was the recipe that inspired me to create Geeky Chef , so it 
holds a very dear place in my heart and stomach. 
In Twilight Princess , Link is told that a monster has been seen around Zora’s domain 
and seems to have an aﬃnity for reekﬁsh, which is a sort of red-colored ﬁsh known for its 
pungent smell. You track down the monster by following the scent of the reekﬁ sh into the 
snowy mountains. Upon ﬁ nding the “monster,” you discover that he is a yeti named Yeto 
who lives in the Snowpeak Ruins with his wife. The Yeti’s wife (Yeta) has fallen ill and the 
reekﬁ sh is needed to go in the soup that will make her feel better. When you arrive in the 
ruins Yeto prepares the soup’s reekﬁ sh base, but he wants to add more ingredients to make 
the soup even better. So he sends you oﬀ  to perilously retrieve a pumpkin and some goat 
cheese from a diﬀ erent area of the ruins. There’s just something about coming back to the 
warm kitchen of the icy abandoned ruins where Yeto is brewing a giant cauldron of soup 
that’s very comforting.
This recipe is pretty simple because I wanted the three main ingredients to shine; 
everything else is just there to complement and enhance. I’ve revised it slightly from the 
version that is on the blog, but not much. This is truly one of my favorite soups, and I hope 
you guys enjoy it as much as I do!INSPIREDBYTHELEGENDOFZELDA

This is a dish that has appeared throughout most of the Star Trek  series, dating all the way 
back to TOS. It is a traditional breakfast dish of the Vulcans, also called Plomeek Broth. In 
the original series, Christine Chapel serves the soup to Spock during his Pon Farr (sort of like 
Vulcan mating season—Vulcans become a little psychotic during this time), and Spock throws 
the bowl at her. There were many references and appearances on the Enterprise  as the soup 
seemed to be a favorite of T’Pol.
Vulcans (unlike us illogical humans) eat for practical purposes only, not for pleasure, so most 
of their food is considered pretty bland and boring by human standards. Vulcans are also vegan 
by nature so their food does not contain any animal products. Plomeek soup is no diﬀ erent in 
those regards; however, the soup can be spiced up a bit. On DS9, Bashir orders it with a “touch 
of basil,” and on Voyager , Neelix makes a version that Tuvok ﬁ nds to be “too spicy.” The soup 
doesn’t seem to have a standard color or consistency, as it appears to look diﬀ erent each time it 
is shown, making it logical to assume that the dish is ﬂ exible. I have made a vegan soup that is 
simple tasting and nutritious (though probably a little “spicy” by Vulcan standards), served with 
just a touch of basil. Eat this and you will deﬁ nitely live long and (maybe) prosper. INSPIREDBYSTARTREK

(Text)DRAGONBREATHCHILI
I had to include something from the still undefeated champion of MMORPGs, World of Warcraft .
WoW  is the MMO version of Blizzard’s 1994 hit game Warcraft . At the peak of its popularity, 
the game had over ten million subscribers worldwide. I myself have spent a good deal of my 
life in Azeroth and I don’t regret it. Though the game has a reputation for being addictive and 
isolating, WoW  has been an important place for geeks everywhere to gather and build a diverse 
and vibrant community. Spend, like, ten minutes in Barrens chat and you’ll see what I mean.
As players know, there are hundreds of food items in World of Warcraft . The reason I chose 
Dragonbreath Chili is because it has one of the most dramatic food eﬀ ects in the game. Also, chili 
is a great food to eat while playing WoW  because it’s easy to reheat, it’s versatile, it’s nutritious, 
and your keyboard won’t get all greasy—plus, it’s easy to reheat. I know pizza tends to be the 
gaming food of choice, but I’m telling you, chili is where it’s at. This recipe is a modiﬁ ed version 
of my favorite gaming chili, made so hot you’ll be breathing ﬁ re. The secret ingredient is coﬀ ee, 
which I know sounds kinda weird, but it adds a great depth of ﬂ avor and, of course, caﬀ eine. 
Before you do your dailies, prep the chili and let it roll while you quest—an hour or two later, 
you’ll have some delicious fuel to get you through the grind. I speak from experience.INSPIREDBYWORLDOFWARCRAFT

everything is lightly caramelized, about 5 minutes. 
2In a separate pan, brown the ground mystery meat. Try not to break it up too much while 
browning if you want bigger pieces of meat in the chili. After it’s done browning, drain the excess 
fat, if necessary.
3Add the meat to the onions and peppers and mix together.
4Transfer everything to a stock pot or Dutch oven with all the remaining ingredients and stir 
together over a high heat for 5 minutes, or until it starts to bubble.
5Reduce the heat to low and simmer the chili, uncovered, for around 2 hours. Stir and taste 
periodically to see if you want to add more spices. Chili tends to burn and harden on the base of 
the pot, so it’s good to scrape the bottom with a wooden spoon occasionally.

Adventure Time  is an animated series on Cartoon Network that follows Jake the Dog and Finn the 
Human in their wacky adventures in the land of Ooo. It began as an animated short that went 
viral and eventually became its own series. Adventure Time  makes frequent references to video 
games, epic fantasies, and other geeky stuff. Though the target audience is primarily children, Adventure Time  appeals to children and adults alike…especially adults who feel like they are just 
really tall kids.
One of the many fun and unique things about the show is the music. This particular gem of a 
recipe comes from a little ditty called, yep, you guessed it, “Bacon Pancakes,” written by Rebecca Sugar. It is sung by Jake the Dog during the episode “Burning Low” as he makes breakfast. The concept of bacon pancakes is pretty simple: you take some bacon and put it in a pancake, and then top the cakes off with some maple syrup for a breakfast that is truly mathematical!inspired by Adventure time
mAkes 10 PA ncAkes
10 strips of bacon, fried  
until crispy
1 cup (120g) flour
2 tablespoons sugar1 teaspoon baking powderPinch of baking soda2 tablespoons butter, melted, 
plus extra for frying
¾ cup (180g) buttermilk1 eggPinch of saltMaple syrup, to serve 1 Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda in a 
mixing bowl. 
 2 In a separate bowl, whisk together the butter and buttermilk, then whisk in the egg. 
 3 Tip the flour mixture into the buttermilk mixture and whisk together until it is lump-free. 
 4 Prepare a large skillet by melting some butter to prevent the batter from sticking, then add as many bacon strips as you can put in the skillet with enough distance between each one to add the pancake batter. You will probably have to do this in batches.
 5 Pour the pancake batter down the length of each bacon strip until it is covered. Make sure the batter around one bacon strip does not touch the batter covering a neighboring strip of bacon—you want them to be individual pancakes and rectangular-ish. 
 6 Cook until the pancake batter starts to bubble on the surface, then flip them over and brown the other side. Repeat until there are no more slices of bacon. Drizzle with maple syrup and serve. Defiance.

This one appeared in the 2012 film version of Marvel’s beloved comic series The Avengers . It’s no 
secret that I love Joss Whedon, because I frequently remind people of this fact. The Shawarma 
joke actually has an awesome double-geek meaning. At the end of Nicholas Brenden’s audition for the role of Xander in Buffy the Vampire Slayer , he asked everybody out for Shawarma. Joss 
Whedon found it hilarious and the gesture may have ultimately landed him the role. Over a decade later, Tony Stark casually invites the rest of the Avengers out for Shawarma after saving New York from an extra-terrestrial invasion. After the film’s credits, you can see the exhausted Avengers quietly enjoying a Shawarma together in a local New York joint. 
After watching The Avengers , I went out and tried some Shawarma from a local eatery and 
was much delighted. Shawarma is an Arabic meat preparation, involving roasting meats on a vertical spit for hours. Shavings of the meat are cut and stuffed into a pocket of pita bread with various veggies and sauces. Despite not having access to a spit at home, there are a few ways of making a decent homemade Shawarma. Soon you’ll be chowing down on some just like Thor in The Avengers . Seriously, watch it again. He is loving it.inspired by the Avengers

 1 Slice the chicken breasts and thighs into 2-inch- (5 cm) thick strips and put in a mixing bowl. 
Add the olive oil and all of the remaining chicken ingredients and combine, making sure the chicken pieces are evenly coated with oil and spices. 
 2 Transfer the coated chicken to a zip-top plastic bag and leave to marinate in the fridge for as long as possible—preferably overnight, but for at least 2 hours.
 3 Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Place the chicken on an aluminum foil–lined baking sheet and roast for about 15 minutes, turning the pieces over halfway through the cooking time. 
 4 Remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes. Meanwhile, make the sauce  
by thoroughly combining all of the sauce ingredients. Set aside.
 5 Thinly slice the cooked chicken. 
 6 Heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan, add the sliced chicken, and sauté until it turns brown and crisp on the edges. Be sure not to overcrowd the pan—you may have to do this in batches. You can add some additional spices (from the chicken section) at this point if you like things spicier. 
 7 Time to assemble the pita! If desired, grill your pitas lightly for about a minute on each side. Open the pita and evenly spread the sauce inside, then fill the pocket with the chicken, onions, tomatoes, and cucumber to your personal preferences. Enjoy!

Deadly Premonition  is definitely a unique experience. There’s a lot of depth and variety to this 
video game, but there are also a lot of things that don’t make sense. The latter adds to the 
charm for fans of the game…and alienates a good amount of other people. It’s been described as a good bad game, and I think that sums it up pretty well. 
This sandwich appears in an optional cutscene in the A&G Diner, wherein Harry Stewart 
stops by to order it while York (the protagonist of the game) and Emily are having lunch. York originally thinks Mr. Stewart is eating this bizarre sandwich to punish himself, but, using rhymes and the frequent repeating of “so says Mr. Stewart,” York is persuaded to give it a try. Surprisingly, or maybe unsurprisingly, York loves it. 
Eating this sandwich is actually a lot like playing Deadly Premonition  in that you feel like 
you shouldn’t like it because it doesn’t make any sense, but you kinda do anyway because it’s strangely addictive. The flavor combination is similar to the iconic Thanksgiving sandwich—similar in much the same way Deadly Premonition  is similar to Twin Peaks —yet it’s somehow 
even more bizarre. I recommend adding a bit of heat for some extra punishment. That seems like a good idea, doesn’t it, Zach? My coffee says so.inspired by deAdly premonition

(Text)BulgAr AshkhAn
Defiance is a show on the Syfy network with a corresponding MMORPG. It takes place around 
thirty years in the future after a bunch of alien races have arrived on Earth and terraformed the 
entire planet. The story follows the humans and aliens coexisting in a town called Defiance, formerly St. Louis, Missouri. Defiance exists independently of the Earth Republic, which controls the majority of what was once North America. Because the town does not exclude any type, it is a melting pot of alien races, who all bring their own cultural influences, including food. 
Bulgar Ashkhan is a traditional dish of the Castithan race—a race who are pale and nice to 
look at but have a tendency to be arrogant and self-serving. The dish is seen in the season 1  
episode “Brothers in Arms” when it is prepared for alien mob boss and quasi-villain Datak Tar. It looks like pink oatmeal but is clearly savory, given the identifiable ingredients shown on the preparation table: red chili, bell pepper, and spices. When I first heard the characters say “Bulgar Ashkhan,” I thought they were referring to actual bulgur (the wheat), so I have included that in the ingredients and made a sort of spicy pink curry. No shtako, it is delicious! inspired by defiAnce

(for color) 1 In a large pan, sauté the onion and garlic in oil or butter over 
medium-high heat until the onions are translucent.
 2 Add the bell pepper and chili and sauté for 5 more minutes.
 3 Add the ground pork, basil, and fish sauce to the veggies and  
stir to combine, breaking up the pork. Cook until the meat is no longer pink.
 4 Tip the cooked bulgur into the pork mixture and combine thoroughly, continuing to sauté on medium–low heat.
 5 Stir in the red curry paste—it should evenly coat everything in the pan—then add the coconut milk and stir some more.
 6 Let simmer, uncovered, for about 10 minutes. Add the beet juice or food coloring right before you're planning to serve and stir to make sure the color is evenly dispersed.hAsPerATinspired by stAr trek

hAsPerAT
Hasperat has appeared in three Star Trek  series: Voyager , TNG , and most often in DS9 . It’s a 
traditional Bajoran dish, made from a brine that is known for being spicy enough to make one’s 
eyes water and figuratively set the mouth on fire. I felt the need to clarify “figuratively” because this is Star Trek  we’re talking about—anything can and does happen. Hasperat is mentioned 
(and eaten) pretty often in Deep Space 9 , as this particular series takes place in Bajoran territory. 
It is also a favorite of TNG ’s Ensign Ro, whose father made an especially strong Hasperat.
Hasperat generally appears as a wrap or burrito and is eaten with the hands. So, this recipe is 
for a grilled wrap with hot pickled veggies (for the brined element) and hot sauce, complemented by cheese, avocado, and onions. It will make your eyes water and will definitely sear your tongue, but it will be so tasty, you’ll happily endure the pain. This makes for a wonderful light lunch or an on-the-go meal to take to the holodeck or on an away mission outside your home after watching Star Trek  all day.inspired by stAr trek

 4 Roll up the tortillas tightly and tuck in the ends. If you wish, you can lightly grill them on each side for a few minutes.

(Text)rock sirloin
Rock Sirloin or Sirloin Rocks has been mentioned or appeared in three Zelda games: OoT , MM, 
and TP. It is a “food” item eaten only by the Goron race, whose diet consists solely of rocks. The 
Rock Sirloin is sort of like the lobster of Goron cuisine: it’s fancy. It’s only found in Dondongo’s 
Cavern, making it a rare and somewhat dangerous delicacy. In Majora's Mask , getting a Rock 
Sirloin is necessary to obtain one of the game’s many masks. 
Rock Sirloin appears as rocks in the shape of a cut of meat that only seems to exist in Japanese 
cartoons. I imagine that Goron’s Rock Sirloin is crunchy on the outside and filled with tender earthy/meaty flavor on the inside. So, I made a simplified but incredibly tasty version of a beef Wellington, which is tender beef coated with duxelles and wrapped in a crispy, buttery puff  pastry, which just so happens to look like a rock when cooked. The flavor is both earthy and rich. Draw yourself a bath, put on Saria’s Song, and pretend you're a Goron luxuriating in a hot spring while eating a delicious Rock Sirloin.inspired by the legend of zeldA

(Text)BIGKAHUNABURGER
Quentin Tarantino’s ﬁ lms are not everyone’s cup of homicidal tea, but they have a strong cult 
following and are widely acknowledged for their memorable characters, excellent dialogue, 
and well-choreographed violence. Personally, I am a huge fan. The ﬁctional burger joint Big 
Kahuna Burger is mentioned in several of Quentin Tarantino’s ﬁlms, but the most memorable 
reference occurs in the classic Pulp Fiction , in the infamous scene when Jules and Vincent bust 
in on the unfortunate folks who wronged Marcellus Wallace and proceed to eat their burgers 
and shoot up the place. 
So, Big Kahuna Burger is clearly a HA-waiian-themed burger joint, but what Jules appears 
to be eating in the scene is a typical fast-food burger. I wanted to reconcile those two things so 
that the burger would taste Hawaiian but look like the generic burger in the scene. I ﬁgured, 
in true fast-food tradition, to put the diﬀerentiating element in the patty itself. The patties are 
made with pineapple and bacon mixed into the beef and coated in teriyaki sauce. Make sure 
to eat them before eleven in the morning because hamburgers are, in the immortal words of 
Jules, the cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.INSPIREDBYPULPFICTION

 1 Heat a grill to medium. You can also use a frying pan over medium-high heat.
 2 In a mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, bacon, onion, egg, crushed pineapple, bread crumbs, 
and salt and pepper. 
 3 Form 6–8 meat patties from the mixture—their size will depend on how large the buns are.
 4 Coat each patty with teriyaki glaze.
 5 Grill or fry the patties on both sides to the desired doneness.
 6 While the patties are cooking, toast the buns. 
 7 When the patties are done, glaze each one again with more teriyaki, then top with a slice of cheese.
 8 Spread some ketchup over the cheese and place the patties on the bottom bun. Load up with any additional burger toppings you want to use, then finish with some lettuce leaves. Close each burger with the top bun and press down.
 9 Use the burger as an effective intimidation technique because you are bad…and wash down with a tasty beverage—like Sprite!

Redwall is one of those series that’s just filled with beautiful descriptions of food. Candied 
chestnuts, dandelion cordials, honey-covered hotcakes, shrimp garnished with cream and 
rose leaves… I couldn’t possibly cover all of it. For more scrumptious Redwall  recipes from the

Deeper’n’Ever Pie’s full title is Deeper’n’Ever Turnip’n’Tater’n’Beetroot Pie. So, for some 
context, the characters in the Redwall  series are all anthropomorphic animals (primarily 
woodland creatures) with cultures, dialects, and dispositions that are determined by animal type. This pie is the favorite dish of the moles, who unsurprisingly enjoy root vegetables.  
I added cheese and herbs to make a delicious and earthy pie that will hopefully make the moles say, “Boi ’eck, oi loik dis pie, yes zurr! Quoite noice, says oi!”inspired by redwAll

 1 To make the crust, combine the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Cut the butter into small 
pieces and add to the flour. Using your fingers, press the butter into the flour until it reaches a crumbly texture. Add the ice water, a little at a time, until the dough binds and can be formed into a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
 2 Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll the dough out to fit a 9-inch (23 cm) pie pan. Place the crust in the pan and carefully and evenly press the dough into its bottom and sides. Trim any excess dough and set aside. Sprinkle a little of both cheeses into the crust to just cover the base.
 3 To make the filling, add the milk, butter, shallots, garlic, thyme, paprika, nutmeg, and salt and pepper to a small pan. Simmer until the shallots soften. Remove the milk and shallot mixture from the heat and stir in the sour cream. 
 4 Cover the cheesy crust with a layer of beets. Spoon some of the creamy shallot sauce over the beets and top with another layer of cheese. On top of the cheese, add a layer of potatoes. Cover the potatoes with a layer of creamy shallot sauce and then more cheese. Add a layer of turnips on top of the potato/sauce/cheese layers and cover with more shallot sauce and cheese.
 5 Roll out the remaining dough and cover the pie filling. Press down on the edges to seal, then trim the excess dough.
 6 Cut slits in the center of the pie as vents. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the pie crust is golden and flaky.

Klingons: they’re fearless warriors but they eat some nasty foods by human standards. Gagh 
is a popular Klingon dish composed of serpent worms. It is mentioned in TNG ,DS9, and 
ENT . One of my favorite episodes of TNG  is “A Matter of Honor,” in which Riker participates 
in an oﬃ cer exchange program and becomes acting commander of a Klingon vessel. A man 
after my own heart, Riker samples some Klingon cuisine in order to prepare himself for this 
monumental responsibility, including what looks like a giant octopus, something called 
Pipius Claw, and, of course, Gagh. Later in the episode, while eating dinner with the members 
of his Klingon crew, Riker is pressured to eat Gagh how it is supposed to be eaten: alive 
and wriggling. After being teased a little by the Klingon crew members, Riker eats the Gagh 
without ﬂ inching, which impresses the Klingons. Riker himself is impressed that Klingons are 
actually capable of humor, having only had Lieutenant Worf as an example of Klingon behavior. 
Basically, everyone learns more about each other and much bonding ensues. Deﬁ nitely in my 
top ten TNG  episodes. 
Gagh comes in diﬀ erent varieties and looks a little diﬀ erent each time it is depicted. I tried 
to emulate the version from “A Matter of Honor” with some delicious stir-fried noodles. The 
best part about making this dish is watching as the “worms” squirm when you cook them. 
That may sound kinda gross, but I assure you, they are delicious. Still, if Klingon food is too 
strong for you…INSPIREDBYSTARTREK

 1 On medium-high heat, sauté the garlic, onions, and bacon in a large, deep pan for a couple of 
minutes. Add the mushrooms and cabbage and sauté for a couple more minutes, combining everything.
 2 Crumble in the bouillon cube, pour in the water, and let everything simmer for 5 minutes.
 3 Add the soy and hot sauces and cook, stirring, for about a minute.
 4 Stir in the udon and fettuccine noodles so that they separate and mix in with the other ingredients. 
 5 Add a few drops of red food coloring, if you like, and stir to spread evenly.
 6 Cook until most of the liquid is absorbed and the noodles are soft.
 7 When serving, squeeze a bit of lemon juice over the noodles.

Oh, the food of A Song of Ice and Fire . For someone who claims not to be a great cook, George 
R. R. Martin sure knows how to make up some mouthwatering foodstuffs. There is an infinite 
amount of foods to choose from in ASoIaF , enough to fill an entire cookbook of its own. 
Happily, there is one! A Feast of Ice and Fire would look pretty good next to this cookbook on your nerdy cookbook shelf. It’s definitely on mine! As great as the official cookbook is, I had to try my hand at a few recipes myself.
One of the more memorable sweet treats in ASoIaF is Sansa Stark’s favorite pastry: Lemon 
Cakes. Lemon Cakes are mentioned fairly often in the books, but not described in detail. My impression of them is that they are a sort of teatime treat for young lords and ladies to enjoy. I pictured them being rustic in appearance (by modern standards; they’d be fancy in Elizabethan times and by Westerosi standards) and having a dense, moist texture with intense lemon flavor. My cakes are just that, and baked with a candied lemon slice for garnish. inspired by A song of ice And fire

I fell in love with Portal  a little late. I remember a friend telling me about it—something about 
shooting portals at walls? I didn’t really get it. When I finally gave the game a shot a few years 
later, I spent the whole night playing through and finished it in the wee hours of the morning, and then promptly passed out. In Portal , you find yourself in a research facility with no idea 
how you got there. You are told by GLaDOS (an artificial intelligence with some emotional issues) that if you complete a series of tests, you will be given cake and grief counseling. Soon you find out that the cake is a lie.
So, the cake. The infamous, ever-popular, and often-referenced cake. There is an Easter 
egg in the game itself where you can find a recipe for cake written in binary code, but the recipe is only an ingredients list for plain chocolate cake and lacks instructions…though it does have some great suggestions for garnishes. According to the developers, the design of the cake (which you do finally see at the end in most versions of the game) was inspired by a real cake from the Chinese bakery near their place of work, identified as a Black Forest cake. Black Forest cake is a kind of German cake that has chocolate, whipped cream, cherries, and a cherry-flavored liquor called kirschwasser. It has four layers and is filled with boozy chocolate cherry goodness. Bake this cake and throw a big party that all your friends are invited to! Don’t forget to invite your weighted companion cube… Oh, wait… inspired by portAl

(Text)1Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) and grease and ﬂour two 8-inch (20 cm) cake pans, or line with 
parchment paper.
2Combine the ﬂour, cocoa, baking soda, and the salt in a large mixing bowl. Set aside.
3Beat the shortening and sugar together until ﬂuﬀy. Add the eggs and vanilla and beat thoroughly.
4Slowly beat the ﬂour mixture into the sugar mixture, occasionally alternating with the buttermilk. 
Beat until everything is combined.
5Pour the batter into the cake pans and bake for 35–40 minutes, or until a wooden pick comes out 
clean when inserted into the center of the cakes. Let the cakes cool completely—by keeping them 
in the fridge for a few hours, they will be easier to cut.
6Meanwhile, make the ﬁlling. Drain the canned cherries in a colander to remove most of the juice.
7Beat the whipping cream with the confectioners' sugar until it thickens to the desired texture.
8Set aside a small amount of the whipped cream mixture for decorating the cake. Mix the cocoa 
powder into the remaining whipped cream mixture.
9After the cakes have cooled, cut each cake in half horizontally to make four layers. Sprinkle each 
layer with the ½ cup (120ml) of kirsch.
10Place one cake layer on the serving dish you wish to use. Spread about one-sixth of the whipped 
cream on the layer and one-third of the cherries on top of the whipped cream.
11Place the second cake layer on top of the ﬁrst. Spread one-sixth of the whipped cream on the second 
layer and one-third of the cherries on top.
12Add the third cake layer. Spread one-sixth of the whipped cream on top along with the remaining 
cherries.
13Top with the last cake layer. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining whipped cream 
frosting.
14Use a vegetable peeler to create thin shavings from the chocolate bar. Gently pat the shavings onto 
the sides and top of the cake, completely coating it. Use gloves—melting chocolate can get messy!
15Use the reserved whipped cream frosting to dot eight small circles around the top of the cake. 
Place your non-stemmed maraschino cherries on each one.
16Place a white candle in the center of the cake and light it. Congratulations, you have made the cake 
a reality!

 2 In a large mixing bowl, use a mixer to cream together the butter and sugar for the cakes. Add one egg and continue mixing. Once the egg is incorporated, add the other egg and the vanilla extract and continue to mix for a minute or so until smooth.
 3 In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, and baking powder.
 4 Slowly mix the dry ingredients in with the creamed butter and sugar mixture. Finally, slowly mix in the milk until batter is smooth. Divide batter evenly among the muffin tin cups.
 5 Bake between 20–25 minutes, or until edges of cakes are golden and a toothpick inserted into the cakes comes out clean. 
 6 Around 15 minutes before the cupcakes finish baking, make the glaze. Heat the butter in a saucepan over medium heat until golden brown, about 10 minutes. 
 7 Pour butter into a bowl. Add the confectioners’ sugar, imitation butter flavor, and milk, and stir until smooth. If glaze is too thick, add more milk; too thin, add more sugar.
 8 While cakes are still hot, pour the glaze on top of them and insert one cherry into the center of each cake by pressing down gently so it’s partially imbedded.Butter CAkeS
I am a huge fan of Silent Hill  and have long lamented that it’s not exactly a great environment 
for noms. Being trapped in a terrifying hell dimension of guilt and torture doesn’t exactly make 
you hungry, as Heather points out in Silent Hill 3 . So, when I discovered the presence of the 
mysterious Butter Cakes, I was ecstatic. Apparently, there’s a running gag among Silent Hill fans to try to find all the boxes. So far, Butter Cakes have been discovered in the second, third, and fourth games, which just so happen to be my favorites in the series. I know that not a lot of people like SH4 , but personally, I think it has the scariest monster in any game ever—the one 
with the baby heads that points and whispers at you. Eeeeeeesh. inspired by silent hill

I lack hand-eye coordination so I tend to be very bad at shooters, and because of that, it’s hard 
for me to get into them. Bioshock  is an exception. Developed by Irrational Games, Bioshock
is almost universally acknowledged as an exceptional and unforgettable gaming experience. 
It takes place in a secret underwater city called Rapture. Rapture was built by an ambitious 
American shortly after the end of World War II for the purpose of forming a completely isolated 
capitalist society untainted by government or religion. Shockingly, this didn’t exactly work 
out. The isolation of Rapture made it somewhat of a time capsule, but the lack of moral or 
governmental limitations in invention has allowed for some very advanced technology to be 
created, so it’s a completely unique game environment. 
The food is mostly of a pre-packaged variety with a focus on convenience. These Creme-
Filled Cakes are one of only three kinds of food found in the game, along with potato chips 
and Pep Bars. There is more than twice that amount of alcohol varieties in the game, which 
tells you a lot about the citizens of Rapture. The cakes come in a sort of log shape, much 
like a certain beloved snack cake found in the real world. They also appear to be ﬁlled with 
chocolate creme and have sort of a squiggly frosting design on top. INSPIREDBYBIOSHOCK

(Text)1Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
2If you don’t have a canoe pan, I recommend making the cake molds ﬁrst. Tear out a 12-inch- (30 cm) 
long sheet of aluminum foil. Fold it once lengthwise and then once crosswise. Place a spice jar in 
the center and wrap the aluminum foil around it, tucking in the ends to create a trough-like shape. 
Make sure the tops are open so you can pour in your batter. Remove the spice jar. Repeat until you 
have about 10 of these.
3In a large mixing bowl, sift together the ﬂ our, sugar, baking powder, and salt. 
4Add the butter, milk, and vanilla and beat with a hand mixer for 3–4 minutes. Add the eggs and 
beat for 3 more minutes.
5Spray the cake mold(s) with nonstick spray. Pour the batter evenly among the cups—they should 
be around three-quarters full. Depending on the size of the spice jar used, you can end up with 
anywhere between 8 and 12 cakes.
6Bake the cakes for about 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. 
Let the cakes cool in their cases, then remove and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
7Meanwhile, make the ﬁ lling. Put all the ﬁ lling ingredients into a mixing bowl and beat until light 
and ﬂ uﬀ y. 
8Place the ﬁ lling into a pastry bag with a narrow attachment. Using a chopstick, evenly poke three 
holes into the bottom of one of the cakes. Sort of swish your chopstick around a bit in there to 
create more room for the ﬁ lling. Pipe the chocolate ﬁ lling into each of the holes, repeating this 
process for each cake.
9When all the cakes are ﬁ lled, attach a narrow frosting piper onto the tube of white decorative 
frosting and draw squiggles on the top of each of the cakes. 
10Stuﬀ  all the cakes into your mouth immediately while in the middle of a battle.

(Text)Sweet roLL 
The highly desirable Sweet Roll is probably the most well-known food from The Elder Scrolls 
series. The stolen Sweet Roll has been a running gag in Elder Scroll  games dating all the way 
back to Arena , where it was referenced in a theoretical question to determine your character 
class based on the morality of your answer. Now, Sweet Rolls are an alchemy ingredient in Oblivion , an actual consumable item in Skyrim , and even appeared in Fallout .
It is unknown what exactly a Sweet Roll is; what is known is that they are so tasty that people 
want to steal them from you—a crime punishable by a night in jail. Presumably, they are a delicious sugary baked good. In Oblivion , they have a shape sort of like a tall muffin or a chef’s 
hat. In Skyrim , they look like a volcano with white icing. The difference in appearance may be 
due to regional differences in Tamriel, as Oblivion  takes place in Cyrodill and Skyrim  takes place 
in…Skyrim. I went with the Skyrim  appearance. Enjoy a volcano-shaped cinnamon cake filled 
with sugary, buttery, nutty goodness, topped with cream-cheese icing. There are two ways to bake these: with a mini Bundt-cake pan for a perfect shape (these can be found fairly easily online) or in a standard glass measuring cup.inspired by the elder scrolls

 2 To make the cake, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a large mixing bowl.
 3 Mix together the milk, egg, vanilla extract, and butter in a separate bowl. 
 4 Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and combine thoroughly. 
 5 Grease the inside of an oven-safe glass measuring cup or mini Bundt-cake pan. If using a glass 
cup, add the batter to the 1 or 1½ cup (240 or 350ml) line, depending on how tall you want the cake to be. If using the Bundt-cake pan, simply add an even amount of batter to each cup.
 6 Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until you can stick in a knife and it comes out clean. 
 7 Remove from the oven and let the cake(s) cool. Once cool, carefully remove from the measuring cup or pan so it does not break. 
 8 If using a glass measuring cup, the cake is going to be upside down (so the wider part is at the bottom) and may be awkwardly rounded on the bottom side. To fix this, simply cut off the rounded bottom with a knife to make it level. Set the cake down with the wider leveled side on the bottom. Use a spoon or fork to carve a hole at the top of the cake—this is where you will put the filling. 
 9 To make the filling, mix together all of the ingredients. Stuff the mixture into the hole(s) in the cake(s). 
 10 For the icing, whisk or beat together all of the ingredients until smooth and thick. Gently drizzle 
the icing on top of the cake(s).

Cauldron Cakes are one of the many magical treats that witches and wizards enjoy in the 
world of Harry Potter . They are purchased by an eleven-year-old Harry Potter for himself 
and his new friend, Ron, on their very ﬁrst journey to Hogwarts on the Hogwarts Express. 
J. K. Rowling doesn’t really explain how the cakes look or taste in the books, so readers have 
come up with some imaginative interpretations. For this recipe, I was inspired by the artwork 
on J. K. Rowling’s website, Pottermore, in which they look like cute little chocolate cakes ﬁlled 
with some sort of green goo to resemble a bubbling cauldron. Sidenote: If you are a fan of 
Harry Potter , own a computer, and have suﬀ ered Potter  withdrawal since the books and movies 
ended, get thee to Pottermore right now. Not only is it an extremely fun way to relive the 
books, but there’s just a ton of wonderful art, games, and extra information to be gleaned 
from Rowling herself. Yes, I am absolutely on Pottermore, and will deﬁnitely be your friend.

(Text) 1 Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) and grease a muffin tin.
 2 In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, allspice, and salt. 
 3 In a separate, smaller mixing bowl, beat together the shortening and sugar. Add the egg and 
vanilla and beat until fluffy.
 4 Slowly beat in the flour mixture, occasionally alternating with the buttermilk.
 5 Evenly divide the batter among the holes in the muffin tin(s).
 6 Bake for about 20 minutes, or until a fork inserted into the cakes comes out clean.
 7 Let the cakes cool, then remove them from the tin and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
 8 Meanwhile, make the topping. Combine the cornstarch and water to form a paste.
 9 Beat together all the remaining topping ingredients—except the sprinkles—including the cornstarch paste you just made. The finished texture should be like a thick and gooey slime. If it’s too runny, add more shortening; if it’s too thick (like frosting), add more sweetened condensed milk.
 10 Take the cooled cakes and carve out a shallow hole on the bottom side of each one to be the inside 
of the cauldron that holds the goo.
 11 Spoon the goo into the holes so that they are almost overflowing, then top with sprinkles.

(Text)CAKEBLOCK
Minecraft  is an award-winning indie game that has reached an unfathomable level of popularity 
in a relatively short amount of time. In the game, you mine and craft materials in order to 
build yourself a shelter and survive, or you run around punching things and get beaten to 
death by zombies and/or die of starvation—like me. One of the best things about Minecraft
is that you are given absolute freedom to build whatever you want, however you want. This 
freedom has allowed players to make some very elaborate worlds and buildings, especially 
in the game’s creative mode. Everything in the game—from the animals to the clouds—is 
rendered as textured blocks, including the cake.
Most of the prepared food in Minecraft  is only shown in your inventory, but the cake is an 
exception. The cake block is made by combining three buckets of milk, two units of sugar, 
three units of wheat, and one egg. When the cake is crafted, it needs to be placed on top of 
another block in order to be enjoyed. Each slice of cake recovers two hunger units, and eating 
the entire cake will recover twelve hunger units. Unlike the other foods in Minecraft , slices of 
cake are eaten instantaneously and you can gobble down the whole cake in seconds—much 
like real life. The cake is depicted as having white icing and little red pixels on top. 
This recipe is for my favorite white cake layered with strawberry jam ﬁlling to complement 
the red pixels. You will need to use fondant to recreate the geometric patterns and clean lines 
of the cake’s topping. INSPIREDBYMINECRAFT

(Text) 1 Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
 2 Cream together the butter and sugar then add the eggs and vanilla extract and continue mixing. 
 3 Mix in the flour, baking powder, and salt.
 4 Grease the baking pans and divide the batter equally between them. Bake for 30–40 minutes, or 
until a fork inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean. Remove from the oven and leave to cool.
 5 Once cool, carefully level the tops of the cakes using a sharp knife.
 6 Set one cake on a board and spoon half of the jelly on top, spreading it around evenly, keeping it about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in from the outer edges of the cake.
 7 Set the other cake on top and spread the rest of the jelly over the top and slightly over the edge of the second cake layer.
 8 Here comes the hard part: fondant is unforgiving and difficult to work with, but I’ll do my best to explain this next step. Roll out the white fondant until you have a surface area large enough to cover your entire cake. 
 9 Carefully lift the fondant sheet by gently flipping one end over the rolling pin and raising it up and onto the top of the cake, making sure it is completely covered. Then, using your hands, gently press the fondant around the cake, trying to avoid making any folds or creases.
 10 Using a sharp knife, scalpel, or scissors, cut out the square pattern in the fondant on the sides of the 
cake. I highly recommend creating a template or stencil by cutting the shape out of some cardboard before attempting this, and using a photo for reference.
 11 You have a few options for the red squares on the top of the cake. Option 1: Roll out some pre-made red fondant and cut out the square shapes. Wet them lightly on the back and arrange them on top of the cake. This is the easiest and best-looking option. Option 2: Roll out the white fondant, cut out the square shapes, and paint them individually with red food dye. Then lightly wet the back (unpainted) side of each and carefully arrange them on top of the cake. Option 3: Position the white fondant squares and paint them in situ with red food dye.
 12 Cut the cake into six (or more) square slices and enjoy!1uP muSHroom CuPCAkeSinspired by super MArio bros.

Like most people born after 1985, I grew up playing Super Mario Bros.  games. The series, 
created by Nintendo’s very own mad genius Shigeru Miyamoto, is one of the most widely 
known and beloved game series of all time. The games feature Mario, a portly Italian plumber 
with inexplicably superior athletic ability and stamina. He is in love with Princess Toadstool, 
aka Peach. Unfortunately for Mario, the princess is kidnapped by King Koopa, aka Bowser, 
about every year or so. Fun fact: Mario actually made his ﬁ rst appearance as Jumpman in 
Nintendo’s 1981 arcade game Donkey Kong .
One of the many iconic items in the Mario series is the 1Up Mushroom. Unlike the red 
toadstool, which allows Mario to grow in size, the 1Up Mushroom gives Mario another life 
and another chance to fall into the abyss or be killed by ﬁre-breathing plants. The 1Up’s 
appearance has changed over the years, but most will recognize it as the bright green 
toadstool with white spots. I generally try to avoid making cakes that look like things that 
are not supposed to be cakes, but this is an exception. Mario was the catalyst that made 
gaming what it is today and is a piece of geek cultural history. Short of encouraging people 
to eat a raw toadstool (do NOT eat raw toadstools…) there wasn’t any other way to pay tribute 
to Mario in food. 
You can make the frosting in this one either green or red, depending on whether you 
want another life or to grow in size. Well, eat too many of these babies and you’ll grow in 
size either way.INSPIREDBYSUPERMARIOBROS.

(Text)This is from my very favorite TNG  episode, “Phastasms,” in which the android Data is testing 
a new program that allows him to dream. It turns out that androids do not dream of electric 
sheep; they dream of rotary telephones in their belly, brain slurpees, and their colleagues 
being turned into cakes. 
The cake, which is human shaped and has Deanna Troi’s head, is described by an 
uncharacteristically excited Worf as a “cellular peptide cake with mint frosting.” Cellular 
peptide isn’t actually a thing, but it is described in the episode as a chain of molecules found 
in living things. This recipe is for a moist white cake with some very blue, mint-ﬂavored 
frosting. I used yogurt as a moistener for the cake itself because yogurt contains living bacteria 
and represents the cellular peptide. It’s important to make the cake look like a TNG  Starﬂeet 
Medical uniform, which is much easier than it sounds. Enjoy this lovely cake with a brain

Turkish Delight isn’t fictional at all, but it’s such a staple of fantasy food I couldn’t not make a 
recipe—that would pretty much be nerd blasphemy. Those who have read The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe  will remember the very tense moment when little Edmund meets the sinister 
White Queen and stupidly reveals the location of his siblings for a bit of Turkish Delight. Edmund was kind of a jerk at that early point in the story, but the way Turkish Delight was described in the book made it seem like such a heavenly treat that you could almost—almost—empathize with the little brat.
So, Turkish Delight is actually a sweet and chewy confection that is traditionally flavored 
with rose water and nuts and served with a coating of confectioners’ sugar. I’ve kept this recipe very old school because why mess with tradition when it’s already so good you’ll sell out your own brothers and sisters for a piece?inspired by The ChroniCles of narnia

 3 Bring the mixture to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes without stirring. Remove from heat and set aside for 10 minutes.
 4 Stir in the vanilla extract, rose water, pistachios, and a few drops of food coloring, if using. 
 5 Pour into a greased 6 × 6-inch (15 × 15 cm) baking pan. Leave uncovered in a cool place for 24 hours.
 6 Sift the confectioners’ sugar and corn flour together onto a sheet of parchment paper. Turn out the set Turkish delight onto the paper and cut into squares using a sharp knife. 
 7 Toss pieces in the confectioners’ sugar mixture so that all sides are coated. Pack the squares into airtight containers lined with parchment paper and dust with the remaining confectioners’ sugar mixture.

It’s impossible to resist a series with so many good food moments. For some context, the people 
of Avatar fall into four different nations that are each devoted to one of the four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. Some people in these nations have command of their national element; this skill is known as bending. The national element and the bending skill has a lot of influence on the culture of the nation and, of course, their cuisine. The fire nation tends to like things spicy, the water tribe eats a lot of seafood and soups, etc. These Fruit Pies are an airbender dessert that appeared in the third episode of the series in a flashback/memory of Avatar Ang’s,  
in which he fondly remembers his airbending master making the pies so that they could airbend them onto the heads of the other air monks. Ang’s master tells him that the secret is in the “gooey center.” In a later episode, Ang divulges that the pies are his favorite food!
My idea for this one was to make the outside part angel food cake because it requires a 
certain amount of airbending. It’s topped with colorful whipped cream (more airbending) and filled with a delicious, gooey tropical-fruit mixture. The combination of textures and tastes makes it very much like eating a strawberry shortcake. Of course, you can use whatever sort of fruit filling you want—the recipe is flexible like that.inspired by avaTar: The lasT airbender

(Text)1First make the ﬁ lling. Add all the ingredients into a large pot and cook over a medium heat until 
the fruit has softened, about 15 minutes. Set aside to cool.
2Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Do not grease the pie tins, although you can line them with 
parchment paper if you don’t mind ridges.
3Sift together the ﬂ our, ¾ cup (125g) of the sugar, and the cornstarch. Set aside.
4In a large mixing bowl, add the egg whites, salt, cream of tartar, and coconut extract. Whip the 
mixture with a beater until stiﬀ  peaks form, then start to gradually whip in the remaining sugar, 
maintaining the peaks.
5Fold in a quarter of the ﬂ our mixture at a time, making sure not to overmix. The batter will 
inevitably deﬂ ate somewhat, so don’t be too alarmed when that happens. 
6Gently divide the batter among the two pie pans, being careful not to knock out too much air.
7Bake for about 30 minutes on the lower rack of your oven. When they are ready, the tops of the 
cakes will bounce back when poked.
8Let the cakes cool completely in their pans—this can take an hour or more. 
9Meanwhile, make the topping. Add all of the topping ingredients into a large mixing bowl and 
whip using a mixer until you start to get peaks. Be careful not to mix too much and get butter. 
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the fridge until ready to use.
10Remove the cooled cakes from the pans and cut 1 inch (2.5 cm) oﬀ  the top of the cakes using a 
serrated knife. Set these cake tops aside. Hollow out the bottom parts of the cakes using a small 
knife to leave a 1-inch- (2.5 cm) thick shell. Remember that the pies are upside down to emulate the 
shape in Avatar .
11Spoon the fruit ﬁ lling into the space you have carved out and replace the tops of the pies.
12Using a piping bag, set up with large star attachments, pipe the whipped cream topping onto the 
center of the tops of the pies in a swirling motion.

Harry Potter’s favorite dessert! Harry loves Treacle Tarts so much that he smells them even 
when in the presence of Amortentia.
Treacle Tarts are a traditional English dessert, popular among children and made with 
golden syrup. Golden syrup has an irresistible nutty and buttery flavor, with almost the same consistency as honey. I can see why Harry likes it. It’s truly liquid gold and my new favorite thing ever. Watch out, Felix Felicis! Well, pop the stuff in a flaky tart crust and it is pure heaven. And by “heaven” I mean Hogwarts. inspired by harry poTTer

For the crusts
1¾ cups (210g) flour, plus 
extra for dusting
¾ cup or 1½ sticks (170g) 
butter, chilled and diced 
¼ cup (50g) sugar 
2 egg yolks 1 tablespoon orange zest
For the filling
1 cup (350g) golden syrup 1 tablespoon molasses 2 tablespoons butter Pinch of salt6 tablespoons bread crumbs 3 tablespoons heavy cream1 tablespoon flour 1 tablespoon lemon zest1 egg, whisked
Whipped cream, clotted 
cream, or vanilla ice 
cream, to serve 1 First, make the crusts. Blend the flour and butter in a food processor 
until crumbly. 
 2 Add the sugar and blend again briefly to combine. 
 3 Add the egg yolks and the orange zest and pulse until it comes together. You may need to add a little bit of water if it seems dry. 
 4 Wrap the pastry in plastic wrap and chill for about 30 minutes. 
 5 Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). 
 6 Meanwhile, make the filling. Heat the golden syrup and molasses in a saucepan over medium heat for 3–5 minutes, or until loosened, stirring occasionally. 
 7 Remove the syrup from the heat and stir in the butter, salt, breadcrumbs, cream, flour, and zest until combined. Stir in the egg and set aside.
 8 Roll out the pastry on a floured surface until it is 
¹⁄8 inch (3 mm) 
thick, then stamp or cut out circles big enough to fit your tart tins. You can use a cookie cutter for this if necessary. 
 9 Mold the circular dough cut-outs into the bottoms and sides of the tart tins, fill each with the treacle filling, and bake for approximately 20 minutes, or until the treacle is firm and set and the crust is golden.

PumPkiN PAsTies
Another mouthwatering Harry Potter  classic! Pumpkin Pasties are mentioned fairly often in the 
Harry Potter  series, though never described in detail. They are sold at the Honeyduke’s Trolley 
on the Hogwarts Express. They were one of the first wizard foods Harry Potter ever ate, along 
with Chocolate Frogs and Cauldron Cakes.
A pasty is a sort of hand pie, thought to have originated in Cornwall, England, where they 
are the regional specialty. They are semi-circular in shape and are traditionally made with pie crust filled with meat, potatoes, and other savories. However, because in Harry Potter  Pumpkin 
Pasties are sold alongside other sweets, there is a consensus that they are a dessert. I’ve made a simple pastry crust filled with spiced, sweetened, gooey pumpkin goodness. It’s sort of like a delicious, portable pocket of pumpkin pie!inspired by harry poTTer

(Text)1First, make the crust. Combine the ﬂ our, salt, and sugar until well blended. Add the butter cubes and 
toss until coated. Using your hands, rub the butter into the ﬂour until dough is in bean-size pieces. 
2Add the shortening to the dough and toss, then rub the shortening into the ﬂ our using the same 
method as with the butter, until you have pea-size pieces.
3Sprinkle in about half of the ice water and use your hands to squeeze the dough together, being 
careful not to overwork it. Keep adding a little bit of ice water at a time until the dough comes 
together but is not wet—you may not need to use all of the water.
4Form the dough into a ball, cover with plastic wrap, and put in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
5Meanwhile, make the ﬁ lling. Add the eggs and sugar to a mixing bowl and combine until 
well blended. 
6Stir in the pumpkin, butter, salt, and spices. Pour in the evaporated milk and stir well. 
7In a large greased casserole dish, bake the ﬁlling at 425°F (220°C) for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven 
temperature to 350°F (180°C) and continue baking for 45 minutes, or until your fork comes out 
clean when inserted into the ﬁlling. Let it cool completely. 
8Roll out the pastry until thin and cut into circles about 4 inches (10cm) in diameter. 
9Put a heaping spoonful of the pumpkin mixture toward one side of the center of the circle. Fold over 
the crust into a half-circle and ﬁrmly press the edges closed. 
10Cut three small slits in the top for venting and place on a greased cookie sheet. 
11Raise the oven temperature to 400°F (200°C) and bake until crust is a light golden brown, around 
10 minutes. 
12If desired, mix some cinnamon and melted butter together and brush the pasties after they come 
out of the oven.

Kingdom Hearts  is where Final Fantasy  and Disney collide. In the first game, you play as Sora,  
a kid from an isolated island who finds himself thrown into a crazy adventure involving 
Disney and Final Fantasy  characters alike. In the beginning of the second game, however, you 
are another kid, named Roxas. Roxas and his friends live in a place called Twilight Town and spend their time getting into trouble and eating Sea-Salt Ice Cream on top of the clock tower overlooking the town. Later in the game, the characters of Kingdom Hearts II  can often be seen 
talking about—and eating—this delicious salty-sweet dessert.
Apparently, Kingdom Hearts II  director Tetsuya Nomura had this ice cream on a trip to the 
Tokyo Disneyland Resort and liked it so much, he decided to work with Disney to put it into the games. It has a characteristic sky-blue color and is only ever seen being eaten on a popsicle stick. I have learned a lot since I originally posted the recipe for Sea-Salt Ice Cream on my blog, so I have revised the original recipe and I think it is greatly improved. The ice cream is sweet, cold, smooth, and creamy with a hint of sea salt to finish. Enjoy this with your best buddies at twilight on a warm summer day.inspired by Kingdom hearTs

 6 Add a few drops of the blue food coloring, a little at a time, and stir constantly until the color is 
right and the custard thickens, about 12 minutes. Make sure not to boil the custard. 
 7 Chill the ice-cream base in the refrigerator until cold.
 8 If using an ice-cream maker, transfer the chilled ice-cream base to your machine and churn according to the manufacturer’s instructions—it should come out like soft-serve. Spoon into a freezer-proof container and place in the freezer until ready to serve. 
 9 If not using an ice-cream maker, place chilled ice cream in a frozen stainless-steel mixing bowl and let the mixture sit until the edges start to freeze, about 15–20 minutes. Use a spatula or whisk to rapidly stir the ice cream, mixing in the frozen edges. Return the stainless-steel bowl to the freezer. Vigorously stir the ice cream every 30 minutes until it is firm, between 4–6 times. If it’s too hard to stir, place in the fridge until it softens, then stir again.
 10 If you’re making popsicles, spray the insides of the molds with nonstick cooking spray and pour the 
ice cream into each mold. Add the sticks and freeze for at least four hours.

Pokémon is a worldwide phenomenon. The video games and anime TV series blew up in 
a big way in the ’90s and the brand has, ahem, evolved over time. Now there are movies, card games, collectibles, and even knockoffs based on the beloved Japanese animal things. Amazingly, the brand is just as popular today as it was over a decade ago, if not even more so. On planet Earth today, approximately zero humans are unaware of the existence of Pikachu. I’m old enough to remember the world before Pokémon and let me tell you, it was about  
25 percent less adorable. 
As most know, the basic premise of Pokémon is that there are these creatures and 
you must collect them all because reasons . Well, sometimes your Pokémon need to eat.  
One of the more interesting consumables, Poffins, are depicted as little multicolored  
football-shaped pastries. When a Pokémon eats a Poffin, one of their conditions (smart, cute, tough, etc.) improves based on what kind of berry is used in the creation of the Poffin. I tried a few different things for poffins, including filling them with jelly and trying to incorporate fruit in the dough itself, but let’s just say it wasn’t very effective. See what I did there?  
Their final incarnation, which I have included here, is as a light buttery roll filled with a fruity custard.inspired by poKémon

 1 First, make the filling. In a medium saucepan, bring the milk, sugar, vanilla extract, salt, cornstarch, 
and egg yolks to a boil, whisking constantly. 
 2 Reduce the heat slightly and continue to boil for a couple minutes. Stir constantly and make sure to scrape into the corners of the saucepan. 
 3 Take the saucepan off the heat and plunge into an ice-water bath to stop the eggs cooking further. Set aside to cool completely.
 4 Now make the dough. Combine the water and yeast in a mixing bowl and let stand for 5 minutes.
 5 Stir in the butter, sugar, eggs, food coloring, and salt. Add the flour, 1 cup at a time, and beat in. 
 6 Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. 
 7 Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking pan with parchment paper. 
 8 Turn out the dough onto floured surface and divide into 24 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball shape. 
 9 Add the berries to the custard filling and stir in. If you are using larger berries or fruit, such as strawberries, cut them into smaller pieces first.
 10 Take one ball of dough at a time and press down on it to flatten it slightly. 
 11 Spoon about 1½ teaspoons of the custard filling into the center of each roll. 
 12 Pull up the sides of the dough and fold them over the filling, making sure each ball is completely 
sealed. You may need to wet your fingers to create a good seal. To be extra safe, put the ball sealed side down when baking.
 13 Mold the dough into the Poffin shape and repeat for each piece of dough.
 14 Let the Poffins rest somewhere warm for 25–30 minutes.
 15 When done resting, put the Poffins onto your parchment-lined baking sheet.
 16 Brush the Poffins in egg wash and sprinkle sesame seeds on top of each one.
 17 Loosely cover the baking sheet with aluminum foil, to prevent browning, and bake for about  17 minutes, or until firm.

It might be debatable whether South Park  is really “geeky,” but I think the show has earned a lot 
of geek cred over the years with detailed references to such definitively geeky things as World  
of Warcraft , comic books, and Star Trek . South Park  is generally not a good source of fictional 
food inspiration, as most of the satire is based in the real world and the show tends to aim for 
gross rather than appealing, but there is one exception: Chef’s Chocolate Salty Balls. 
Chef, voiced by the late Isaac Hayes, was the portly and promiscuous cafeteria cook for 
the first ten seasons of the show. As one of the more kind and down-to-earth characters, his advice was often sought by the four protagonists…though his advice generally manifested itself in totally inappropriate and non-relevant soul songs. This recipe comes from one of those humorously misguided soul songs, probably the most popular song from the show, titled “Chocolate Salty Balls.” The song basically describes a recipe for a salty spherical chocolate pastry to…suck on. Despite the obvious metaphor here, I thought a salty spherical chocolate pastry sounded pretty darn good, and I was right! Chef’s balls are delicious! inspired by souTh parK

 8 Bake for 35–45 minutes, or until a fork inserted in the center comes out clean. Be careful not to 
burn your balls! 
 9 Let the mixture cool just enough so that it won’t burn your hands. Meanwhile, set up a small plate or cutting board with some of the sea salt on it. 
 10 Scrape up the brownie mix, working around the edges—you don’t want to use the hard edges for 
these balls. 
 11 Begin shaping rough 1-inch (2.5 cm) balls out of the mix, then roll them in the salt. Do this very lightly—a little sea salt goes a very long way. 
 12 If you do happen to oversalt, just brush off the excess crystals. Too much salt is bad, mmmkay? When you’re done, put ’em in your mouth and suck ’em!

My family: your obsession with food rubbed off on me and this happened! So much love for my best friend and soon-to-be husband, Jeff Diza, for driving me all 
over the place for ingredients, weathering my mental breakdowns, and for taking care of our little flock. You were there when I first had this wacky idea and you encouraged me to follow through. Your misguided but unwavering faith in me has helped me to have some marginal faith in myself.
Jessica Rausch and Wesley Garcia, thank you for being my quality-control minions! Jess, we 
were the ultimate fangirls in our formative years, weren’t we? I think, like the butterfly effect or a water droplet on Laura Dern’s skin, I might never have started Geeky Chef  if I hadn’t met you. 
Kyle Cyree, your experience and advice when it comes to making and drinking alcoholic 
beverages was invaluable. Thank you for being such an awesome boss, you have helped me immeasurably on both a personal and professional level.
Amanda and Brian Backur, thank you for taking the time to test some of these recipes for 
me and giving me such great feedback. I can’t wait to meet little Beowulf!
Thank you to my evil twin sister, Cassandra Rabini, for being a sounding board for my mom  
while she looked for typos and grammatical errors. And for watching The Lord of the Rings with me thirteen times.
Thanks to Denis Caron, for designing my amazing new logo, which I adore so much, and 
taking in stride my flights of whimsy and ever-changing mind in regards to the creation of said logo.acknowledgments
