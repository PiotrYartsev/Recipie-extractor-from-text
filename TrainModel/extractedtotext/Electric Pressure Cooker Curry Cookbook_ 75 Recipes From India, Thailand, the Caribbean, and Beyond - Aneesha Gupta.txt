xiINTRODUCTION
Hi there. I’m Aneesha, a foodie by birth, who turned a passion 
for cooking into a recipe blog at SpiceCravings.com. On my 
blog, I share my family’s favorite global recipes that are low 
in effort and big on taste, thanks to smart cooking appliances 
like an electric pressure cooker.
I started cooking in my early teens in India by helping my mother in 
the kitchen and inherited her recipes for traditional North Indian Punjabi 
food, including many classic curries, like Rajma, Chole, Butter Chicken, 
and Dal.
I learned from my mother that you don’t have to spend hours in the 
kitchen to make tasty and healthy meals for the family—and the pressure 
cooker played a big part in that. Mom always used her stovetop pressure 
cooker for making beans, lentils, and meat curries. So, naturally, I became 
a pro at pressure cooking very early on.
In my early travel-heavy career as a flight attendant, I was exposed to 
cuisines from around the world, and then 20 years ago I settled down in 
California, a melting pot of all cuisines. I was amazed at how every culture 
and region has their spin on a basic curry. Over the years, I adapted these 
recipes for my stovetop pressure cooker and achieved the same results 
with much less time and effort.
About four years ago, I bought my first electric pressure cooker, an 
Instant Pot, during a Black Friday sale. The level of convenience it added to 
my life amazed me. Back then, as a graphic designer, my average day was 
filled with client meetings, deadlines, and kids’ after-school activities, and 
then I had the challenge of cooking a healthy meal for my family in a short 
amount of time. I felt like the electric pressure cooker was a godsend. I could 
sauté in it, fill the pot with ingredients, set it to cook, and walk away! No 
monitoring or heat adjustments needed—that was a game-changer for me.
Electric pressure cookers are ideal for making curry for three reasons. 
First, they provide a gentle and consistent heat, which allows the spices to 
release their natural oils and aromas and ingredients to infuse their fla -
vors in each other, so the result mimics the taste of a slow-cooked curry. 
Second, it’s a huge time-saver. I can turn dried beans or tough cuts of  | INTRODUCTION xiimeat into that “melt-in-the-mouth” texture in an hour, most of which is 
hands-off cooking time. Third, cooking a curry in an electric pressure 
cooker is as simple as sauté, fill, and start. Even my husband and teen girls 
have become curry experts now.
In 2017, I started Spice Cravings as an online resource for my teenage 
kids to teach them an essential life skill—cooking—and the electric pressure 
cooker made that possible. The blog soon became a platform to share easy 
recipes for busy families like mine. And with this book, I continue that effort.
This book is for all curry lovers—beginners and advanced cooks alike. 
Whether you’re cooking for two or 20, these easy-to-follow directions will 
help you master the world of curries in your electric pressure cookers. If 
you have any questions about these recipes, send me a message on my 
blog, SpiceCravings.com, or my Facebook or Instagram page (facebook.
com/spicecravings and instagram.com/spicecravings), and I’ll be happy to 
help. On that note, I hope you enjoy cooking these recipes as much as I’ve 
enjoyed developing and testing them. Happy cooking!
Curry: A Saucy History
Who doesn’t love a bowl of hot curry soaked up with naan  or rice? It’s food 
for the soul!
Did you know that this mystic dish is eaten by more than half the world 
and has been around since the 15th century?
The origin of curry can be traced to the Indus Valley civilization, dating 
back to 2600 BCE. Archaeological evidence from Mohenjo-Daro suggests 
the use of a mortar and pestle to pound spices like cumin, mustard, 
fennel, and tamarind pods to flavor food.
So, what exactly is curry? Curry means many things in many different 
regions. Curry  is a generic term that refers to a spiced dish  originating 
from the Indian subcontinent or from Southeast Asia. Curry is eaten in 
many countries, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, 
Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Jamaica, the United States, and 
England, to name just a few.
Curry can be wet or dry. Dry curries are cooked with just enough liquid 
to coat the ingredients in the spice mixture, whereas wet curries often INTRODUCTION  |  xiiiinclude either a tomato, yogurt, coconut milk, or cream sauce, or gravy. 
It is usually eaten with rice or a flatbread, like roti  or naan.
Curry originated in India thousands of years ago and the word comes 
from the Tamil (Indian language) word kari , which refers to a meat- or 
vegetable-based stew. In the early 1500s, after the Portuguese captured 
Goa in India, they introduced chilies to the local stews and called them 
carel . In the 18th century, when the British came to India, they trans -
formed carel to curry .
Curry powder, which is a popular premixed spice blend, didn’t come 
from India at all but in fact is an 18th-century British invention. It’s a 
blend of coriander, cumin, ginger, black pepper, cardamom, mustard, cay -
enne, and turmeric, which gives it the yellow color. The first curry powder 
recipe in Britain appeared in the book The Art of Cookery Made Plain 
and Easy, by Hannah Glasse in 1747.
The British can be given credit for spreading curry  across the world . 
Popular dishes like Coronation Chicken and Jubilee Chicken , in which 
cooked chicken was served with a curry-flavored creamy sauce, were 
 created in mid-1900s to celebrate different British monarchs, including 
Queen Elizabeth II.
During the 19th century, colonization, Indian migrations, and interna -
tional trade further spread curry to other Asian countries, Europe, and 
South Africa. Curry was even carried to the Caribbean by Indian laborers 
who worked on the British cane plantations.
As curry traveled, it was adapted and modified to incorporate local 
ingredients and cooking techniques, which is why there are so many vari -
ants around the world.
Every curry dish has a unique taste, color, and heat level depending on 
the specific spice blend, ingredients, and regional influences. For example, 
the Mughal Empire (15th century) influenced curries in northern India, so a 
chicken curry made in the north may taste and look very different than one 
made in southern India. Similarly, Thai Green Curry  tastes quite different 
from Thai Massaman Curry  due to the ingredients used in the curry paste.
While this book is certainly not a comprehensive collection of every 
existing curry, I am presenting a range of popular world curries, ones you 
might have enjoyed at local restaurants, and that can be made with easily 
available ingredients. I hope you enjoy them as much as my family does.1CHAPTER 1
MAKING CURRY  
IN AN INSTANT
Electric pressure cookers have been an integral part of my 
kitchen in recent years.
They are a huge time-saver, and I love how ingredients get a 
chance to blend together in an electric pressure cooker. 
Whether you’re cooking soups, stews, or, in this instance, curry, the result 
is always a perfect harmony of infused flavors.
Even though stovetop pressure cookers have been used for such a long 
time, especially in countries like India, they can seem intimidating to 
many people and do require some careful monitoring.
Fortunately, the current fleet of electric pressure cookers that are so 
popular today, like the Instant Pot, have bridged the gap between tradition 
and convenience. These “smart cookers” enable a home cook to program 
and automate the cooking process without having to babysit the appli -
ance. I can follow the instructions for a recipe, fill the pot, seal and set it 
for pressure cooking, and walk away . I couldn’t imagine that level of 
 convenience until a few years ago. | ELECTRIC PRESSURE COOKER CURRY COOKBOOK2Benefits of Cooking with an  
Electric Pressure Cooker
Pressure cooking is when food is cooked in a sealed vessel at high pressure 
with water or other liquid. The higher pressure limits the liquid’s ability to 
boil by trapping steam, which raises the atmospheric pressure inside the 
pressure cooker. This makes the boiling point of the liquid 250 degrees 
Fahrenheit instead of the normal 212 degrees, which is how it cooks 
food faster.
Here are some of the many reasons why an electric pressure cooker is 
the perfect appliance for making curry:
1. You save time:  Red meat and bean curries require a long cooking time. 
Pressure cooking cuts that active cooking time in half. Not only does it 
save time, but it also reduces energy usage.
2. It allows hands-off cooking: This is a huge advantage, especially for 
curries that take a long time to cook. Once you initiate the pressure 
cooking process, the cooker takes care of all the work from there. 
You don’t have to monitor it or make any heat adjustments.
3. You can multitask: Using the pot-in-pot cooking style, you can make 
the whole meal in your cooker at the same time, like rice with chicken 
curry. With simple accessories, you can cook multiple items  
simultaneously.
4. The controls are simple and straightforward: With built-in presets 
like “beans, ” “rice, ” and “meat, ” all you have to do is push a few buttons 
and follow the steps and the recipes come out consistent every time.
5. It locks in nutrients: An electric pressure cooker cooks food at a 
higher pressure but lower temperature than oven or stovetop cooking 
methods. The steam cooking process locks in the nutrients in food and 
preserves them better than the other cooking methods.
6. You get more intense flavors: Pressure cooking releases a gentle heat 
that allows the spices to release their natural oils and aromas, and the 
end result is a combination of flavors that makes it seem as if the recipe 
has been slow-cooking for hours.MAKING C URRY IN AN I NSTANT   |  37. There’s no odor: Most curry recipes use strong and aromatic spices 
that permeate the entire house, including clothes and upholstery. The 
sealing technique in the electric pressure cooker locks in those aromas, 
creating no to very minimal external odor.
8. It doesn’t heat up the house: In the summer, running the oven can 
really heat up the house. Cooking in the pressure cooker can achieve 
similar results without heating up the house.
Types of Electric Pressure Cookers
Due to the recent rise in popularity of electric pressure cookers, there are 
currently many different brands and models to choose from. Here are 
some of the most popular models for readers who are new to electric 
 pressure cooking.
While varying in size, most of these electric pressure cookers can per -
form the following basic functions: pressure cook, slow cook, cook rice, 
sauté/brown, steam, and keep warm.
Instant Pot Lux: Available in 3-quart, 6-quart, and 8-quart sizes, this is the 
entry-level product from the Instant Pot brand. I consider this the best ver -
sion for everyday users if you don’t care about a yogurt function and 
low-pressure setting. Latest models also include cake and egg maker 
functions.
Instant Pot Duo:  Available in 3-quart, 6-quart, and 8-quart sizes, this is the 
number one bestseller on Amazon . A great cooker for beginners, it includes 
the yogurt function, while the low-pressure setting allows more control 
over cooking delicate food such as seafood and vegetables.
Instant Pot Ultra:  This model is for the advanced cook and includes 21 preset 
temperature options and a sous vide feature. It also offers the altitude adjust -
ment  preset, which is great for those living in high altitude. The winning 
feature is its self-sealing lid , which eliminates the chance of your forgetting  
to seal it. It is available in 3-quart, 6-quart, and 8-quart sizes.
Mealthy Multipot 2.0: Available in a 6-quart size, this model is comparable 
to the Instant Pot Ultra or Duo Plus. Its winning feature is the hands-free 
and programmable pressure release with the touch of a button. With it, you  | ELECTRIC PRESSURE COOKER CURRY COOKBOOK4Electric Pressure Cooker 
Terminology
All these electric pressure cookers have many buttons and functions that 
do different things, so getting started with electric pressure cookers or 
multi-cookers can seem intimidating.
But don’t worry—it’s much easier than it seems. Here is a list of buttons and 
functions that are common across most electric pressure cookers (the first 
three are ones that I use most for making curry).
 »Pressure Cook/Manual:  This is the most used button. It defaults to high 
pressure (which can be changed to low) and you use [+] and [−] to set the 
cook time.
 »Sauté:  It defaults to the normal or medium heat setting and takes 30 to 
40 seconds for the pot to get hot. Use the default normal/medium setting 
for sautéing veggies, adjust to more/high for browning meats, and adjust to 
less/low to simmer.
 »Keep Warm/Cancel:  Turns on or off the automatic keep warm function. By 
default, it is set to on. This button is also used to end a cooking program.
 »Rice:  This button defaults to 12 minutes at low pressure and is used for 
cooking white rice.
 »Steam:  This button cooks at high pressure for 10 minutes (normal), 
15 minutes (high), or 3 minutes (less). In most models, you have to use an 
external timer for cooking.
 »Slow Cook:  Slow cook on low, normal, or high. Use [+] and [−] to increase 
or decrease the cook time (temperature defaults may vary with different 
models).MAKING C URRY IN AN I NSTANT   |  5
In addition, here are a few terms you will come across in the world of electric 
pressure cooking:
 »Natural Pressure Release (NPR or NR): After the cooking cycle ends, let 
the pot release the pressure on its own. This can take anywhere from 5 to 
30 minutes, depending on the cooking time.
 »Quick Pressure Release (QR or QPR): After the cooking cycle ends, use 
the pressure cooker’s instructions to manually release pressure. Very hot 
steam is released during this process, so follow the recommended safety 
precautions.
 »Low Pressure and High Pressure  (LP and HP):  Most recipes call for high 
pressure, which is the default for most pressure cook/manual presets. 
Low-pressure settings are more suitable for cooking delicate items such as 
seafood and vegetables.
 »Pot in Pot (PIP):  A method used to cook another item or a side dish 
(like rice) in the same pot as the curry or entrée by using a metal trivet. 
The trivet (or rack) sits at the bottom of the inner pot with a 1-to-3-inch 
clearance, depending on its height. Another bowl or dish is set on top of it, 
while the curry cooks in the main pot.
 »Deglaze:  Using liquid to scrape off the brown bits of aromatics (or meat) 
that may have stuck to the bottom of the pot while cooking. This prevents 
the “burn” sign during pressure cooking. | ELECTRIC PRESSURE COOKER CURRY COOKBOOK6can choose between a natural, quick, and auto release of steam. As of now, 
this is the only cooker that offers this feature. All Mealthy models come 
with a set of commonly used accessories as well.
Ninja Foodi: Available in 3-quart, 6.5-quart, and 8-quart sizes, this pressure 
cooker offers the same set of features as its competitors. Its winning feature 
is the TenderCrisp technology, which allows the latest model of the Ninja 
Foodi to double as an air fryer, with an interchangeable lid.
Crockpot Express:  Available in a 6-quart size, this pressure cooker 
includes the same features, including slow cook, pressure cook, sauté, 
steam, yogurt maker, rice, and warm. It comes with a nonstick inner pot 
versus a stainless-steel one, which is the default for most competitors.
Essential Equipment
While the electric pressure cooker is the star of the show in my kitchen—
and this book—there are a handful of other kitchen tools that help make it 
easier to cook curry. These are the underdogs of the kitchen world 
because, no matter how awesome a dish turns out, they never get men -
tioned. The following are some essential pieces of equipment my curry 
kitchen cannot do without:
Spice Grinder/Coffee Grinder:  I have a basic, under-$20 coffee grinder 
dedicated to grinding spices. Some curries tend to come to life with freshly 
ground spices, so this tiny grinder comes in handy for grinding those small 
quantities.
Mini Food Processor:  I call this my sous chef. It takes only a few pulses to 
chop onions, finely chop ginger, garlic, and chilies, and crush or puree 
tomatoes. In less than half the time and effort, this mini food processor can 
prep your ingredients for you.
Immersion Blender:  Some of the popular curries require the sauce to be 
pureed after cooking for a smooth end texture. Immersion blenders, also 
known as stick blenders, enable you to blend hot curry right in the pot 
itself without having to wait for it to cool down. The same results can be 
achieved with countertop blenders as well, but for safety reasons, wait for 
the curry to cool down to blend.MAKING C URRY IN AN I NSTANT   |  7Trivet: It’s a stainless-steel rack that creates a platform for placing another 
bowl in the cooker, without coming in contact with the contents of the main 
pot. It works great for steaming and pot-in-pot cooking. Most current elec -
tric pressure cookers ship with this accessory.
About the Recipes
In addition to a wide variety of globally inspired curry dishes, the recipes 
in this book include everything from spice blends to sides and anything 
else you’ll need for a well-rounded curry meal. While the world offers a 
much larger selection of curries, I’ve covered recipes that are well known 
and more familiar to many of us.
The recipe chapters are broken out by region, so you can flip to the 
section that interests you the most. Meatless recipes are either marked 
vegetarian or vegan, and we’ve also labeled gluten-free, dairy-free, and 
nut-free recipes. Toward the end, you’ll find a chapter for spice blends and 
curry pastes that form the foundation of these diverse curries, along with 
grain and rice side dishes to complete a meal.
All these recipes have been tested multiple times in my 6-quart Instant 
Pot or Mealthy Multipot, but I have tried my best to keep the instructions 
as generic as possible to fit any electric pressure cooker brand you have.
All recipes use standard US metrics (cups and spoon measurements).  
We’ve also included a measurement conversion chart (page 171) if you 
need one.
These recipes were developed to be easily recreated by home cooks of 
all skill levels, from beginners to the more experienced. They will  satisfy 
your takeout cravings in less time than it takes for you to order in, and 
they’re definitely healthier and cheaper than the restaurant alternatives. 
All right, then—let’s get cooking!
A Note about Cooking Time
The total time on these recipes factors in preparation, sautéing, 
pressure-cooking time, 10 minutes for pressure building , pressure 
release times (natural or quick), and any finishing steps. | ELECTRIC PRESSURE COOKER CURRY COOKBOOK8Although I suggest a 10-minute prep time  for most recipes, which 
could involve chopping aromatics, making a spice paste, and/or pureeing 
tomatoes, the actual time varies depending on individual working pace.
If a recipe calls for natural pressure release , the total time can vary 
between 5 and 20 minutes, depending on the cooking time, quantity, and 
your specific pressure cooker brand. All recipes in this book factor in 
either a timed natural release  or a quick-release , which takes about 
one minute.
Most of these recipes can be made in 45 minutes or less from start to 
finish, with a chunk of that being hands-off cooking time (pressure build, 
pressure cook, and pressure release time). There are a few recipes that 
take 60 minutes or longer because they either require marinating the 
meat or soaking ingredients. Even though soaking or marinating is “inac -
tive cooking time, ” it has been mentioned in each recipe under “prep” and 
the total time accounts for that.SPICY LAMB CURRY,  PAGE 3211
CHAPTER 2
THE INDIAN 
SUBCONTINENT
It would not be an exaggeration to say that the Indian subcontinent 
has been a curry hub since the 1500s. The modern-day Indian sub -
continent consists of seven countries: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, 
Sri Lanka, Maldives, Nepal, and Bhutan. But from a culinary point 
of view, it is divided into the Northern and Southern regions. The distinc -
tions are primarily based on two factors: spices and ingredients used in 
regional curries, and the accompanying starch (rice or roti).
One can find many overlaps in curries from the countries in the North -
ern region, including Pakistan, Northern India, Nepal, and Bhutan, with a 
heavy influence of local climate, terrain, and the Mughal Empire. 
Bangladesh shares its flavor profile with West Bengal in India, collec -
tively called Bengali cuisine, in which fresh fish, mustard, and poppy seeds 
are used in many curries.
Curries from the Southern region—including the southern coast of 
India, Maldives, and Sri Lanka—typically contain shredded coconut, coco -
nut milk, curry leaves, mustard seeds, and various chilies and spices to 
season their curries.
While it is impossible to include all regional curries from the Indian 
subcontinent in this book (that would be a book in itself), the following 
are some traditional and popular curries you might have tasted in a 
restaurant or at a friend’s home!

40 minutesThis delicious and spicy chicken curry, called kukul mas, 
is one of the most popular dishes from the exotic island 
nation of Sri Lanka. Bone-in chicken is coated and cooked 
with warming spices like coriander, fennel, cardamom, and 
curry and gets its deep red color and heat from paprika and 
cayenne. Coconut milk cuts through the heat and brings 
this curry to life. The following is my take on a traditional 
Sri Lankan classic.
FOR THE SPICE RUB
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon turmeric
1 tablespoon coriander  
powder
1 tablespoon curry powder
1/2 teaspoon fennel powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon1 teaspoon cardamom powder
1 tablespoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon cayenne powder
1 tablespoon apple cider  
vinegar
11/2 pounds chicken drumsticks, 
skin removed
FOR THE SAUCE
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1 medium onion, chopped
8 to 10 curry leaves
1 tablespoon minced ginger
5 garlic cloves, minced2 tablespoons tomato paste
1/2 cup coconut milk
3/4 cup water
2 tablespoons chopped 
 cilantro (for garnish)ThE INDIAN S UBCONTINENT  |  191. To make the spice rub, in a mixing bowl, mix together the 
salt, turmeric, coriander, curry powder, fennel powder, cin -
namon, cardamom, paprika, cayenne, and vinegar. Using 
kitchen shears, remove the skin from the chicken drumsticks 
and toss them in the spice rub. Set them aside while you pre -
pare other ingredients and start the sauce.
2. Preheat the electric pressure cooker by selecting sauté and 
adjust to high. When the inner pot is hot, after about 
30 seconds, pour in the oil, onion, and curry leaves and cook 
for 5 minutes, stirring in between.
3. Add the ginger, garlic, chicken, and tomato paste, and cook 
for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring in between.
4. Turn off sauté. Add the coconut milk and water and scrape 
off any brown bits that may have stuck to the bottom.
5. Lock the lid in place. Select manual or pressure cook and 
adjust to high. Cook for 10 minutes on sealing mode.
6. When the cooking is complete, wait 10 minutes for natural 
pressure release, after which follow the quick-release method 
as per your cooker instructions. Unlock and remove the lid.
7. Garnish with cilantro and serve with steamed Basmati Rice 
(page 157).
TIP: This recipe uses coconut oil, which contributes to 
the authentic flavors of the curry. However, you can sub -
stitute any clear oil, such as avocado or light olive oil, for 
the coconut oil. If you cannot find curry leaves, substitute 
1/2 teaspoon of lime zest. | ELECTRIC PRESSURE COOKER CURRY COOKBOOK20

region of “British India” as a way to use up leftovers by 
frying them with chiles and onion. Jalfrezi is made by 
stir-frying chicken (or paneer) with onions and peppers and 
served in thick, spicy gravy. Here’s a quick pressure cooker 
version, in which we accomplish the same depth of flavors 
and texture as an authentic Chicken Jalfrezi.
2 tablespoons olive oil 
(divided)
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
1/2 red bell pepper, sliced
1/2 green bell pepper, sliced
2 jalapeños, crowns removed
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 tablespoon minced ginger

2 tablespoons chopped 
 cilantro, plus 2 additional 
tablespoons for garnish
1/2 cup water
1. Preheat the electric pressure cooker by selecting sauté. 
When the inner pot is hot, after about 30 seconds, pour in 
1 tablespoon of oil, the onions, bell peppers, and jalapeños. 
Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until the onions and peppers soften  
a little. Remove and reserve for later.
2. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil followed by the 
cumin seeds.ThE INDIAN S UBCONTINENT  |  253. When the cumin begins to sizzle, add the ginger and garlic 
and cook for 1 minute.
4. Add the tomato, tomato paste, salt, turmeric, coriander, 
chili powder, chicken, and chopped cilantro along with the 
water. Stir everything and turn off sauté.
5. Lock the lid in place. Select manual or pressure cook and 
adjust to high. Cook for 3 minutes on sealing mode.
6. When the cooking is complete, wait 5 minutes for natural 
pressure release, after which follow the quick-release method 
as per your cooker instructions. Unlock and remove the lid.
7. Select sauté to reduce the sauce. When the sauce reaches 
your desired consistency, add back in the reserved peppers, 
onions, and jalapeño, and garnish with cilantro. Enjoy with 
steamed Basmati Rice (page 157).
TIP: Sautéing peppers and onions and adding them back 
after pressure cooking helps them retain their crunch and 
makes for an authentic Jalfrezi curry. For a softer texture, 
pressure cook them with the chicken. Additionally, this 
recipe can be made vegetarian by  swapping paneer for 
the chicken. | ELECTRIC PRESSURE COOKER CURRY COOKBOOK26

CHAPTER 3
THAILAND & OTHER 
ASIAN COUNTRIES
When you think of your favorite curry, a Thai variety prob -
ably comes to mind. But curry has been a part of almost 
all Asian cuisines since the 18th century, thanks to trade, 
colonization, and the famous Silk Route. From Japan to 
Malaysia, almost every Asian country has its own signature curry.
In late 18th century, when the British established the Straits Settlements 
at Penang, Malacca, and Singapore, they brought curry powder with them. 
Soon after, the kitchens in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Thailand incorpo -
rated it into recipes along with local ingredients and created new dishes like 
the Cantonese Gah-Lay  and the Thai Kaeng Kari , to name two. A common 
way to categorize Thai curry is by the color of the curry paste used to make 
the dish.
The British Royal Navy introduced curry to Japan in the late 18th cen -
tury, where it gained popularity as a Western dish. The Japanese army 
and navy adapted it to their tastes and adopted it as convenient canteen 
food, spreading it through the country.
Most Asian-style curries use Indian spices like turmeric, coriander,  
and cumin  and a spice paste for flavor. Many consist of hearty vegetables 
and seasonal produce, and they are often served with rice to complete 
the meal.

 Thailand and perhaps the most unique among all Asian 
curries. Its traditional name, Gaeng Kiew Wan, translates to 
“curry green sweet. ” The green comes from the Bird’s Eye 
chilies used to make the paste, and the sweetness comes from 
the coconut cream and palm sugar. Enjoy this delicious curry 
using homemade or store-bought green curry paste in just a 
little over 30 minutes.

Malaysia, and Thailand. Unlike other curries, this is a 
“dry” curry, which means that the sauce is simmered down 
until there is just enough to coat the meat. This makes the 
end flavors more intense and robust. In this easy variation, 
we infuse the aroma and flavors of all the spices into the stew 
meat by pressure cooking and simmering the curry until the 
sauce reduces and the meat is fall-apart tender.

MIDDLE EAST & 
AFRICA
When we think of Middle Eastern cuisine, we tend to 
think of Doner Kebab , Gyros , Baba Ghanoush , and 
other grilled dishes. But this region has some of the 
most unique curries.
Popular meat curries from this part of the globe are made with lamb, 
chicken, or beef, which are often cooked with locally grown fruits and 
nuts, like dates, pomegranate, figs, pistachio, and walnuts. A classic exam -
ple would be the Persian stew called Fesenjan , in which the meat is 
cooked with pomegranate molasses and toasted ground walnuts.
Curries in North Africa have a Mediterranean and Middle Eastern influ -
ence, with spices like saffron and cinnamon added to the basic curry 
seasoning. Slow-cooked meat dishes like Tagine , which are essentially thick 
curries with intense flavors and aroma, are popular in Morocco and Tunisia.
East African curries consist of lentils and vegetables in addition to meat 
dishes and are very similar in cooking style to Indian curries. Good exam -
ples would be popular Ethiopian stews like Doro Wat (Chicken Curry)  and 
Alicha Wot (Split Peas Curry).  This region also has a few nut-based cur -
ries, like Kunde , in which a simple black-eyed pea curry is thickened with 
roasted ground peanuts.

stew is the national dish of Ethiopia. In this traditional 
curry, chicken is cooked with a classic onion-tomato gravy, 
seasoned liberally with the fiery Berbere spice mix, and 
topped with hard-boiled eggs before serving. The electric 
pressure cooker does a fantastic job of infusing all the earthy 
flavors of the spices in the sauce and chicken in less than 
an hour.
3 tablespoons ghee or 
unsalted butter
1 large onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon minced ginger
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 tablespoons Berbere spice 
mix (page 152), or 
store-bought 2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 cup water, divided
11/2 pounds boneless skinless 
chicken thighs, fat trimmed 
and halved
4 hard-boiled eggs, shelled
2 tablespoons chopped 
 cilantro (for garnish)
1. Preheat the electric pressure cooker by selecting sauté. 
Adjust to high. When the inner pot is hot, about 30 seconds, 
add the ghee. Add the onions with a pinch of salt and cook  
for 7 to 8 minutes, until they start browning.

3. Add the Berbere spice mix, tomato paste, and 1/4 cup water 
and stir well. Turn off sauté.

along with the chicken curry using the pot-in-pot cooking 
method. To do that, assemble the curry as per directions. 
Place a 3- to 4-inch metal trivet or stand in the pot. Place

cooking. In my easy take on this simple and satisfying curry, 
I infuse store-bought clarified butter (or ghee) with an Ethio -
pian spice blend called Berbere to achieve similar results, and 
these creamy split peas come together in less than an hour.

mash the lentils till they reach a creamy texture. Serve warm 
with Buttered Couscous (page 164) or sourdough bread.
TIP: If you can find Niter Kibbeh (seasoned clarified 
butter), use 2 tablespoons in this recipe instead of ghee. 
Note about Berbere: Store-bought Berbere blends tend 
to vary in taste, so start by adding 1 teaspoon and add 
more later after tasting the curry. | ELECTRIC PRESSURE COOKER CURRY COOKBOOK 110

enjoyed all over the eastern coast of Africa. In this mildly 
spiced dish, fish is cooked in a flavorful sauce made with 
coconut milk and tomatoes and is seasoned with curry 
powder. Peanuts enrich the curry and give it a smooth,

sine, it is very popular among the Indian communities living 
in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Traditionally, the chicken is 
char-grilled before adding to the coconut curry, which gives it 
a smoky flavor. In my easy take on this traditional recipe, we 
add smoked paprika to achieve a similar earthy-smoky taste.

migrants brought their curry recipes with them and morphed them 
into new dishes incorporating local ingredients like fruits, nuts, and produce.
Everyday dishes in most Caribbean islands include some combination of 
rice, plantains, beans, cassava (a root vegetable), culantro (an herb similar 
to cilantro), bell peppers, chickpeas, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, and coconut. 
A popular herb and oil paste, called green seasoning, is used as a base for 
many curries and stews, and curry powder is used as a primary spice blend.
Latin America, on the other hand, is a highly diverse area and its cuisine 
shares cultural influences with Africa, Europe, Native America, and Asia. 
Rice and beans are a staple in most countries around here. Curries like 
Cuban-Style Black Beans (page 136) and Red Bean Curry (page 144) are 
part of everyday meals in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and surrounding countries.
An aromatic paste called Sofrito  forms the base for most curries in Latin 
American cuisine. The actual recipe may vary by region, but it is typically 
made of onions, garlic, peppers, and cilantro. Sazón  and adobo  are the two 
main seasoning blends used to flavor meat and bean dishes.
In this chapter, you’ll find quick recipes for commonly used seasonings 
and sauces in addition to a variety of curries from the Caribbean and Latin 
American kitchens.

15 minutesCochinita Pibil is a Yucatan-style barbecue pork in which 
the meat is marinated with citrus juices and a chili paste 
called achiote, made of annatto seeds, which gives this dish a 
deep red color and earthy flavor. Traditionally, the marinated 
meat is wrapped in banana leaves and slow-cooked in an 
underground smoker known as a pib. In this simple recipe, 
we use store-bought achiote paste and pressure-cook the 
pork until it is fall-apart tender.

in most Puerto Rican meals. These flavorful beans are 
simmered in a tomato-and-sofrito-based broth, along with 
potatoes and manzanilla olives. Traditionally, dried red beans 
are soaked and simmered until beans cook through and all 
the flavors blend well. In our quick-and-easy adaptation, we

CHAPTER 6
SPICE MIXES &  
OTHER STAPLES
The difference between a “good” and an “amazing” curry 
depends largely on the spices used to flavor it. What you pair it 
with, whether rice or flatbread, also makes a big difference. 
This chapter is dedicated to the flavor-building spice blends and 
popular sides that enhance curries around the world.
Making a spice blend or paste from scratch may seem time-consuming 
or intimidating, but most of these can be made in 10 to 15 minutes with 
easily accessible ingredients. And thanks to online shopping, ethnic spices 
are now available to most people. Freshly made spice blends add a vibrant 
touch to any recipe. 
In this chapter, I have included recipes for popular spice blends like 
garam masala, curry powder, thai curry paste, and berbere, to name just a 
few. There are many variations of these spice blends, as the ingredients 
differ according to region and individual preferences, but I have chosen 
the most commonly used ones.
Most of these dry spice blends stay fresh for a few months. Just store 
them in an airtight container in a dark, cool place. Similarly, curry pastes 
can be made in advance and stored in the refrigerator or freezer to extend 
their life. Whenever I’m making Thai curry pastes, I double or triple the 
recipe and store the excess in small mason jars or ice-cube trays.
This chapter also features popular staples like roti and couscous that 
are enjoyed with curry, with rice being the common starch among most 
cultures.

Garam Masala
VEGAN • VEGETARIAN • DAIRY-FREE • GLUTEN-FREE • NUT-FREE
Makes:  
1/4 cup
Cook Time: 
2 minutes
Total Time: 
13 minutesGaram Masala is a fragrant blend of ground spices com -
monly used in Indian cuisine. The word “garam” means 
“hot” and refers to the warming spices used in this blend,  
and “masala” means “spices. ” Typically, the spices are toasted 
to bring out the flavor, and then ground to a fine consistency. 
Here’s a classic Punjabi-style recipe that has been in my 
family for four generations.
3 tablespoons coriander seeds
1 tablespoon cumin seeds
2 teaspoons green cardamom  
seeds
1 teaspoon whole cloves1 teaspoon whole black 
peppercorns
2-inch flat cinnamon bark
2 dried bay leaves
1. Lightly toast the coriander, cumin, cardamom, cloves, black 
peppercorns, cinnamon, and bay leaves for 2 minutes over 
medium heat in a dry skillet, until fragrant. Stir often.
2. Turn off the heat and transfer to a plate to stop the cooking. 
Cool for 10 minutes.
3. Transfer to a spice or coffee grinder and grind to a fine 
powder. Store in an airtight container.
TIP: Another popular variation includes fennel, nutmeg, 
and black cardamom seeds. For that, simply add  
1 teaspoon of fennel seeds and 1 black cardamom pod 
while toasting, then stir in a 1/2 teaspoon of freshly grated 
nutmeg to the final blend.SPICE M IxES & O ThER S TAPLES   |  151

that was popularized by the British in the 1800s. Con -
trary to popular belief, it is not used in Indian cooking. The 
British created curry powder as a milder seasoning for Indian 
curries, after which the powder crossed boundaries with 
trade and colonization. Used in many Asian, African, and 
Caribbean dishes, most curry powder recipes include corian -
der, cumin, mustard, and chile peppers in addition to 
turmeric, which gives it the deep yellow hue.

2. In a food processor, put in the toasted spices and the 
paprika, ancho chili powder, red pepper flakes, salt, tomatoes, 
garlic, and olive oil and blend to a smooth paste. Scrape the 
sides in between. Use 1 to 2 tablespoons of water if needed 
to blend.
TIP: Traditionally, dried red chiles are soaked in hot water 
for 30 minutes, then deseeded and used in this paste. To 
use those, skip the chili powder and red pepper flakes,

slight nutty flavor. It is grown in the northern regions of 
India and Pakistan. Deriving its name from the Sanskrit word 
“basmati, ” which means “fragrant, ” it is known for its fluffy 
and separated grains and is a staple with curries across the 
Indian subcontinent.
1 cup basmati rice
11/4 cups water1 teaspoon canola oil or ghee
1/2 teaspoon salt
1. Soak the rice for 10 minutes (white rice only). Rinse 2 or 
3 times until water runs clear.
2. Put the drained rice, water, oil, and salt in the cooking 
insert and stir.
3. Lock the lid in place. Select manual or pressure cook

naturally for 5 minutes, followed by a quick pressure release 
as per your cooker instructions. Unlock and remove the lid.
5. Using a fork, gently fluff the rice, and enjoy!
TIP: Soaking is key to getting a fluffy texture for white 
rice. It gets rid of excess starch and results in each grain 
being separated. It is not required for brown basmati rice 
because it doesn’t have the starch coating. | ELECTRIC PRESSURE COOKER CURRY COOKBOOK 158

made with whole wheat flour. They are a staple in most 
Indian homes and are typically served as a side with curries. 
The dough for roti is made with flour and water and is ready 
for use without any fermentation. 
2 cups whole wheat flour, plus 
1/4 cup, divided3/4 to 1 cup water, or  
 as needed, divided
2 teaspoons olive oil
1. In a large mixing bowl, pour 2 cups flour and 1/4 cup of 
water. Using your fingers, gently mix the dough until all the 
water is absorbed.
2. Add another 1/4 cup water and keep mixing until it starts to 
form the dough. Depending on the brand of your flour, you 
will need 3/4 to 1 cup of water. In the end, the dough should be 
soft but not sticky.
3. Using your fist or lower palm, knead the dough for 
1 minute. Lift the furthest edge of the dough and repeatedly 
fold it back over toward you. Wet your hand to smooth the 
dough. Add the oil and knead for another 30 seconds.
4. Cover it with a damp kitchen towel and rest for 15 minutes 
for the glutens to develop. After that, knead the dough 
once again.
5. To make the roti, divide the dough into 12 equal portions 
about the size of a golf ball and roll in your palms to make a 
round ball. Cover all dough balls with a damp towel.
6. Put the other 1/4 cup flour on a plate for dusting the dough 
while rolling. Ensure that your rolling pin and surface is dry.SPICE M IxES & O ThER S TAPLES   |  1637. Take one dough ball at a time, keeping the remaining 
dough covered with a damp towel so they don’t dry out.
8. Dip the dough ball in the plate of dry flour, shake off  
the excess, then put it on the rolling surface and flatten it 
gently using your hand.
9. Start rolling gently from the center in an outward motion, 
turning it about 45 degrees between each roll. Dust with flour 
in between to prevent sticking.
10. Continue rolling until you flatten the dough into an even 
disc about 7 inches in diameter.
11. Preheat a nonstick sauté pan or skillet over medium-  
high heat.
12. Dust off the excess flour from the rolled roti and place flat 
in the skillet. Cook the roti until small bumps start forming 
on the surface. Depending on how hot your skillet is, it can be 
anywhere between 30 to 45 seconds. Using tongs, flip the roti.
13. Cook until you see bumps develop on this side, about  
15 to 20 seconds, then flip.
14. Using a flat spatula, gently press the roti while rotating it, 
until it begins to puff up.
15. Flip it a few times to cook it evenly. Remove it and place 
onto a paper-towel-lined plate or tortilla case. Repeat the 
process for other roti. Enjoy warm with your favorite curry.
TIP: To enhance the flavor of roti, brush them with butter  
or ghee right after they finish cooking. That also keeps 
them moist and soft longer. | ELECTRIC PRESSURE COOKER CURRY COOKBOOK 164

1 cup couscous (fine)1/2 teaspoon salt
13/4 cups water
1. Put the butter, couscous, salt, and water in the cooking 
insert and give it a stir.
2. Lock the lid in place. Select manual or pressure cook and 
adjust to high. Cook for 2 minutes on sealing mode.
3. When the cooking is complete, let the pressure release 
naturally; it should take around 5 to 7 minutes. Unlock and 
remove the lid.
4. Using a fork, gently fluff the couscous, and enjoy!
TIP: To enhance the flavor of couscous, use chicken  
stock instead of water and add a 1/2 teaspoon of Italian  
seasoning.167ELECTRIC PRESSURE COOKER 
TIME CHARTS
The following charts provide approximate cook times used for a variety  
of foods in a 6-quart electric pressure cooker like the Instant Pot. Larger 
electric pressure cookers may need a little extra time to cook. To begin, 
you may want to cook for a minute or two less than the times listed; you 
can always simmer foods at natural pressure to finish cooking.
Keep in mind that these times apply to the foods when partially  
submerged in water (or broth), steamed, or cooked alone. However, the 
cooking times for a given food may differ when it’s used in different  
recipes, because of additional ingredients or cooking liquids, a different 
release method than the one listed here, and so on.
For any foods labeled “natural release, ” allow at least 15 minutes of  
natural pressure release before quick releasing any remaining pressure. | ELECTRIC P RESSURE C OOKER T IME Ch ARTS 168BEANS AND LEGUMES
When cooking a pound or more of beans, it’s best to use low pressure  
and increase the cooking time by a minute or two, because larger 
amounts at high pressure are prone to foaming. If you have less than  
a pound of beans, high pressure is fine. A little oil in the cooking  
liquid will reduce foaming as well.
Unless a shorter release time is indicated, let the pressure release  
naturally for at least 15 minutes, after which any remaining pressure can 
be quick released.

On January 2, 2020, my husband asked me, “What are 
your top five goals for this year?” The first thing I said was: 
“I want to write a cookbook!” Little did I know that the uni -
verse would align and set me on the path to accomplishing 
this goal so soon. For that, I am really grateful!
I believe that behind every woman who sets out to achieve success, 
there is a village that supports her. My tiny village is filled with the follow -
ing people who have contributed to my life and this book in their own 
special ways. I have each one to thank for being a part of my journey.
My parents, who always believed in me more than I did. My dad taught 
me that it’s never too late to pursue your dreams, and I inherited his pas -
sion to experiment with flavors. Papa, you would have been so proud of 
this book. Miss you! My mom taught me that you don’t have to spend 
hours in the kitchen to cook healthy and tasty meals. Thank you for giving 
me a solid foundation.
My husband, my rock! Thank you for always encouraging me to reach 
for the stars and being my sous chef and recipe taster and for critiquing 
my creations in the most honest (and daring) way. Thanks, also, for clean -
ing up the tornado of a mess that I left behind after recipe testing. Most 
important, thank you for catching me whenever I fall.
My girls, my life! I started my recipe website to teach you two how to 
cook. Some of the best memories in my life are of cooking and baking with 
you. Thank you for supporting me throughout the making of this book, 
making schedules for me, then checking on my progress. I’m sure you had 
fun “mommying” me around. Thank you for being my guinea pigs, for 
eating the same recipe, sometimes meal after meal, until I perfected it, 
and still appreciating it as if you were tasting it for the first time. Mother -
hood made me really evolve as a cook, and I have you both to thank for it.
A heartfelt thanks to my foodie girlfriends for helping me test some of 
these recipes and perfect them.My readers, I cannot thank you enough for all the support you have 
shown me over the past few years. Thank you for trying my recipes, shar -
ing them, and making my day by leaving thoughtful messages on my blog. 
I could not have come this far without you.
And last but not least, thank you to the entire Callisto Media team, for 
giving me this opportunity and helping me accomplish my goal. Special 
thanks to my editor, Gurvinder, for your valuable feedback and support.ABOUT THE AUTHOR
