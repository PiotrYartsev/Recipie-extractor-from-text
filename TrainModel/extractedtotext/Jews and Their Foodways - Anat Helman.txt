2 the essential Jewish CookbookA Celebration of Culinary Tradition
Jewish culinary tradition thrived over thousands of years and thousands of 
miles. Many forces shaped it, but two made an indelible impact.
First: rules. Historically, Jewish dietary practices and the observance of 
Shabbat (the Jewish day of rest) influenced what and how Jews ate. Kosher 
rules governed permissible foods and preparations, resulting in uniquely 
Jewish cooking and recipes. The prohibition of cooking on Shabbat resulted 
in a long tradition of slow-cooked stews, delicious cold salads, and other 
make-ahead foods.
Second: movement. The creation of the Jewish diaspora after 70 CE forced 
Jews from their ancient homeland in biblical Israel, scattering them into new or 
existing Jewish communities worldwide. Faced with repeated religious persecu-
tion, they would move again and again, making displacement a major feature of 
Jewish history. As Jews moved, they adapted local culinary customs, recipes, and 
ingredients for Shabbat and other holiday observances (as well as kosher law). 
When displaced again, they would carry these on to the next home, spreading 
food traditions to new places.
Out of this comes the dynamic and global Jewish cuisine of today, including 
everything from bagels to baba ghanoush and beyond. In discussing Jewish cui-
sine, we often identify it by Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Mizrahi traditions. These 
aren’t all-inclusive categories, but they help us begin to explore Jewish history 
and culinary evolution.
Ashkenazi—of Bubbes and Bagels
If bagels, latkes, matzah ball soup, brisket, and challah are on your list of the most 
iconic Jewish foods, you are not alone. These foods, often lovingly associated 
with Yiddish-speaking Jewish bubbes (grandmas), originated from the kitch-
ens of Ashkenazi Jews, part of the diaspora that settled in Germany and France 
and spread to Eastern Europe. As they moved around the world, they carried 
with them their foodways. Ashkenazi Jews make up the majority of Jews in the 
United States today, so it’s no surprise that their cuisine made a big impact on 
American cuisine, among Jews and non-Jews alike.3 A Rich Nibble of HistoryTraditions
Ashkenazi Jewish culinary traditions center on a handful of core 
 elements, including:
 Ò breads, such as challah, rye bread, babka, bagels, and the bialy—a round, 
bagel-like bread with a flattened center filled with diced onions
 Ò pickled foods, such as pickles, sauerkraut, pickled herring, and cured 
and smoked meats that could be stored for long periods of time; and 
strong-flavored ingredients such as onions, garlic, and dill 
 Ò root vegetables, especially potatoes, carrots, and beets
 Ò stuffed foods, such as blintzes, knishes, kreplach, stuffed cabbage, and 
pierogis, often eaten on holidays (traditional gefilte fish also was origi-
nally stuffed)
 Ò sweets, including cheesecakes, macaroons, mandelbrot, rugelach, haman-
taschen, and sweets using fruit, like apple cake
 Ò warm comfort foods, including stewed meats like brisket and slow-cooked 
stews (cholent) as well as chicken soup (sometimes called “Jewish penicil-
lin”), served with egg noodles or matzah balls
Origins
The Ashkenazi Jewish story began in medieval times, when part of the Jewish 
diaspora settled in shtetls (villages) in what is now modern-day Germany and 
France (“Ashkenaz” is a medieval rabbinical name for Germany). Out of this 
early European life emerged the Yiddish language, derived from German dialects 
and peppered with Hebrew and other languages. Of course, many distinct foods 
emerged as well.
Ashkenazi cuisine was strongly influenced by geography. Cold European 
winters meant relying on hardy root vegetables and cured foods that stored well. 
Jewish cooks also embraced existing local favorites, such as French chopped 
liver and German braided breads, which became challah. They incorporated 
foods introduced by Jewish traders, such as noodles from Italy. And, of course, 
they adapted local dishes to make them kosher and for Shabbat and holiday 
observances (such as replacing bread dumplings with matzah balls for Passover).
In the late Middle Ages, religious persecution forced Ashkenazi Jews east, 
mainly to Poland and Russia. They took German-influenced traditions with 
them and adopted new Eastern European dishes, like bagels, blintzes, and 
borscht. In the late nineteenth century, poverty and persecution spurred yet 
another mass migration of Ashkenazi Jews, especially to North America.4 the essential Jewish CookbookEvolution
By 1924, two million Eastern European Jews had immigrated to the United 
States, establishing enclaves in places like Boston, Philadelphia, and most 
notably, New Y ork City’s Lower East Side. World War II and the tragedy of the 
Holocaust, when six million Jews were killed in Europe, further spurred Ashke-
nazi Jewish migration to the United States (and also Israel, Latin America, South 
Africa, and Australia). As Jews sought to reestablish themselves stateside, their 
foods both influenced and were influenced by American culture.
Early on, Jewish delicatessens sprang up to sell kosher pickled, cured, 
and smoked items and eventually full meals. Popular delis introduced Jewish 
foods like pastrami and corned beef to non-Jewish populations. Older, more 
labor-intensive foods, like kishke (stuffed intestines) and homemade gefilte fish 
(which often involved temporarily keeping a live carp in your bathtub—yes, 
really) gradually fell out of favor with the advent of time-saving appliances and 
canned and frozen foods.
Jews adapted their Eastern European foodways with new ingredients to 
great effect. Take cream cheese, invented in New Y ork in the 1870s. In the early 
twentieth century, Jews adopted cream cheese to “schmear” (spread) on bagels, 
and Jewish bakers substituted cream cheese for curd cheese in baking, paving 
the way for New Y ork–style cheesecake. Modern Jewish cooks continue to use 
new ingredients to tinker with traditional foods, such as gefilte fish made with 
salmon or latkes made with sweet potatoes. Even after centuries of experimen-
tation, though, beloved Ashkenazic classics live on, preserving ties to Jewish 
tradition and community.
Sephardi—Mediterranean Melding
Sephardi Jews were among the first to immigrate to America, arriving as early 
as 1654—but Sephardi culinary traditions are less well known historically in the 
United States. Sephardi Judaism originated in what is now modern-day Spain 
and Portugal. (“Sepharad” refers to the Iberian Peninsula.) These Jews lived there 
for centuries—where they developed a Judeo-Spanish hybrid language, Ladino—
until their expulsion by Spain’s Catholic monarchs in 1492.
Sephardi Jews spread across several regions all around the Mediterranean 
as well as Northern Europe, the Americas, and beyond, and their movement to 
the Middle East and North Africa created an even more fascinating melding 
of traditions.5 A Rich Nibble of HistoryTraditions
Sephardi food varies greatly, but think of it as Jewish Mediterranean food with 
significant Spanish and Middle Eastern influences. Sephardi Jewish cooking 
emphasizes foods found in the temperate Mediterranean climate, including 
fruits, vegetables, herbs, nuts, and olive oil.
For Shabbat, traditions include slow-cooked stews (hamin) prepared before 
sundown and cooked vegetable salads and sweet-and-sour dishes that can be 
served at room temperature or cold. On Hanukkah, when Jews eat oil-fried 
foods, Sephardi Jews might serve fried chicken and deep-fried fritters, such as 
bimuelos (also called buñuelos). Some hallmarks of Sephardi cuisine include:
 Ò chickpeas and lentils
 Ò custards and puddings
 Ò dishes with eggs
 Ò eggplant
 Ò handheld pastries, such as bourekas
 Ò meat-and-fruit combinations, such as chicken with apricots or apples
 Ò nuts, especially almonds and pine nuts
 Ò olive oil for cooking
 Ò onions and garlic
 Ò orange blossom water and rose water
 Ò rice
 Ò sweet-and-sour flavors, in everything from braised peppers to meatballs
 Ò tomato-based sauces and stews
Origins
The Sephardi story began thousands of years ago, when Jews established 
communities in Spain, even before the destruction of the Second Temple in 
Jerusalem in 70 CE. When Spain came under Muslim rule from roughly the 
 seventh to thirteenth centuries, the Jews (and other non-Muslims) there enjoyed 
a relatively peaceful and civilized period.
Muslim rulers introduced culinary practices that Jews adopted, such as 
double-cooking, as well as new ingredients, including raisins and pine nuts. To 
keep kosher, Jewish cooks used olive oil instead of the pork fat used by their 
neighbors and the butter preferred by Arab cooks. They also embraced foods 
introduced by traders, including eggplant, which is featured in many Jewish 
recipes, and produce brought back by Spanish colonizers of the New World, such 
as onions and tomatoes.6 the essential Jewish CookbookIn Italy, a separate Jewish community mostly flourished for much of the 
same period through World War II. Italian Jews are sometimes grouped under 
the Sephardi umbrella due to proximity and the influence of Sephardi refugees 
from Spain, but they existed as a separate community that spoke Italian and had 
their own richly varied Jewish-Italian cuisine (which I cover in my book, Meat-
balls and Matzah Balls).
Evolution
Christian conquerors reclaimed Spain from Muslim rule in the thirteenth 
century. Gradually resentment and violence toward Jews grew. Under pressure, 
some Jews converted to Christianity. “Conversos,” as they were called, some-
times continued their Jewish culinary customs, like avoiding pork and observing 
Shabbat—practices that could mark them for arrest and persecution if discov-
ered by the Spanish Inquisition, which sought to eliminate nonadherents to 
Christianity.
In 1492, the Alhambra Decree ordered practicing Jews be expelled from 
Spain. This huge event scattered Sephardi Jewish communities—and their 
traditions—far and wide, including the Americas and Northern Europe (where 
incidentally Portuguese exiles introduced their recipe for batter-fried fish, later 
widely adopted as fish and chips). A large number of Sephardi Jews headed 
eastward, resettling in regions across the Mediterranean and the vast holdings of 
the Ottoman Empire in southeastern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, 
including what would become British-controlled Palestine. As they joined exist-
ing Mizrahi Jewish communities, especially in places like Morocco, they notably 
melded their traditions with local cuisine.
Following the end of British rule and the passage of the UN partition plan, 
Israel declared independence in 1948. With the reestablishment of a Jewish 
state in ancient Israel, Jews in Muslim-majority countries faced increased 
hostility. Many relocated to Israel or the United States, carrying their rich food 
traditions on to a new chapter.7 A Rich Nibble of HistoryMizrahi—Embracing the “East”
For many years, all non-Ashkenazi Jews were referred to as Sephardi. But that 
binary failed to capture the experience of many Jews who lived in a wide region 
stretching from Greece to North Africa for thousands of years before Sephardi 
migration. In recent decades, the term “Mizrahi” (meaning “east” in Hebrew) 
has come into use to refer to Jews who lived continuously in areas around the 
Middle East but are not of Iberian descent.
When we think of Mizrahi food, hummus, falafel, skewered grilled meats, 
and rice may spring to mind. The reality is more complex, though—the foodways 
of Mizrahi Jews over thousands of years represent a diverse cross-section of 
regions, histories, and cultures.
Traditions
Mizrahi food traditions encompass a wide range of Mediterranean, North 
African, Arab, Indian, and Persian culinary customs. They also sometimes 
reflect the influence of Sephardi Jews who settled in the region after 1492. 
Many Mizrahi food traditions have strong roots in specific regions, resulting 
in Jewish versions of dishes like moussaka from Greece and biryani from the 
Indian subcontinent. In places where Jewish communities were more isolated, 
distinct dishes emerged, such as malawach, a flaky flatbread developed by 
Y emenite Jews.
Some common features of this wide-ranging tradition include:
 Ò aromatic spice blends, sauces, and pastes, such as zhug
 Ò chickpea preparations, including stews, hummus, and falafel
 Ò colorful chopped salads
 Ò cooked vegetable salads
 Ò flatbreads, such as pita, malawach, laffa, and lavash
 Ò ground meats and meat-stuffed dumplings
 Ò meat and rice dishes incorporating dried fruits
 Ò olive oil for cooking
 Ò orange blossom water and rose water
 Ò rice and couscous as staples, as well as in special dishes such as Moroccan 
seven-vegetable couscous served for Rosh Hashanah
 Ò skewered and grilled meats
 Ò slow-cooked stews, such as Ethiopian doro wot
 Ò stuffed vegetables8 the essential Jewish Cookbook Ò tomato-based stews, such as shakshuka
 Ò turnovers, such as sambousak and bourekas
Origins
Mizrahi Jewish history takes us all the way back to the early sixth century BCE, 
when the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem led to the exile of roughly 10,000 Jews 
from Jerusalem to Babylon (modern-day Iraq). Some Jews were able to return 
to Jerusalem, but many stayed in Babylon, which became a bastion of Jewish 
learning, progress, life, and culture in the diaspora until the eleventh century.
Over time, Jews of the Babylonian exile settled in several regions, where 
they developed and maintained close cultural ties to their local communi-
ties. Unlike Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews, Mizrahi Jews often spoke local 
 languages (predominantly Arabic or Farsi), rather than a separate language like 
 Yiddish or Ladino.
Because home regions remain central to Mizrahi Jewish identity, it’s 
helpful to understand the places they have populated: North Africa (includ-
ing modern-day Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and Y emen); the Middle 
East (including modern-day Iran, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, and Syria); Western/
Central Asia, Southeastern Europe, and the Eastern Mediterranean (includ-
ing modern-day Afghanistan, Armenia, Cyprus, Georgia, Greece, Turkey, and 
Uzbekistan, around the city of Bukhara); and India. Ethiopian Jews are some-
times grouped in with Mizrahi Jews, but they are their own separate ancient 
community with distinct religious observances.
Evolution
The Spanish expulsion of Jews in 1492 led to an influx of Sephardi immigrants 
into Mizrahi communities. In regions where Sephardim arrived in large num-
bers, like Morocco, the cuisines melded. Mizrahi dishes like adafina and the 
sweet pancakes called mufleta, eaten for Mimouna (the Mizrahi Jewish celebra-
tion marking the end of Passover), reflect a Spanish influence.
After Israel declared independence in 1948, hostility toward Jews from 
 surrounding Muslim-led countries prompted many Mizrahi Jews—both by 
choice and by force—to immigrate to Israel and the United States. In subsequent 
decades, coordinated Israeli and American efforts fostered Jewish emigration 
and helped evacuate Jews under duress (such as from Ethiopia and Y emen) to 
Israel in great numbers. As a result, very few Mizrahi Jews remain in their coun-
tries of origin today.9 A Rich Nibble of HistoryMizrahi traditions have been welcomed and celebrated in Israel and beyond. 
The Ethiopian Jewish fall holiday Sigd, a half-day of fasting and prayers followed 
by a festival meal of traditional Ethiopian food, became an official holiday in 
Israel in 2008. Foods from Mizrahi traditions, such as Lebanese tabbouleh and 
Turkish bourekas, have been warmly adopted, especially in Israel and also the 
United States. Celebrations such as Mimouna have caught on as well.
Today
This arc of history and experience has produced a remarkable and uniquely 
global food culture. It is one rooted in traditions, experiences, adaptation, per-
severance, and celebration, as well as influenced by the many places Jews have 
called home. It remains dynamic and delicious.
It wouldn’t be unusual for today’s home tables to display a vibrant cross 
section of Jewish culinary traditions. For instance, think of a Rosh Hashanah 
dinner of Turkish and Egyptian black-eyed peas, Moroccan couscous, Sephardi 
and Jewish-Italian sautéed spinach with pine nuts, and Ashkenazi brisket and 
tzimmes, with honey-soaked Middle Eastern baklava for dessert.
Meanwhile, restaurant owners, food writers, and home cooks are exper-
imenting with traditional dishes and cooking methods (such as smoking and 
curing) and reinventing them with regional flair and modern, personal touches. 
The celebratory fusion of foods and traditions shows no sign of stopping, and 
examples—from za’atar challah to food historian Michael W. Twitty's West Afri-
can brisket—continue to delight everyone.
So go ahead and pull some threads on this intricate tapestry and follow a 
trail of culinary wonder. It connects Jews everywhere to thousands of years of 
history and survival—and to each other.10 the essential Jewish CookbookKEEPING KOSHER
Jewish dietary laws, which are called kashrut, have shaped Jewish cooking and 
recipes for thousands of years. Although kosher observance varies widely today 
among many modern and secular Jews, most classically Jewish recipes are 
kosher. Accordingly, most of the recipes in this book generally align with kosher 
rules, either as written or through included variations.
Here’s a quick overview of kosher law. It prohibits consumption of:
 Òcertain animals (such as shellfish, reptiles, insects, some birds, and 
any mammal without cloven hooves and that doesn’t chew its cud, 
such as pigs) and certain parts of permitted animals
 Òblood (it must be drained or broiled out of any meat to be eaten)
 Òdairy and meat foods prepared together or eaten at the same meal 
(foods like eggs, nuts, fruits, and vegetables are considered neutral 
[pareve] and can be eaten with either meat or dairy)
 Òmeat not slaughtered according to Jewish law
In the Kitchen
Having certain tools and ingredients on hand can make the recipes easier and 
more enjoyable to create. Read on to find my recommended list of equipment and 
ingredients, as well as some frequently used techniques.
Equipment
I recommend: good sharp knives (particularly a chef’s knife, serrated or bread 
knife, and paring knife), a blender or an immersion blender, a small food proces-
sor, a handheld mixer, a Dutch oven or deep heavy pot, a deep-fry thermometer, 
and an instant-read thermometer. A large food processor and stand mixer come 
in handy, but are not necessary.
Also note that success will often rely on monitoring the cooking carefully. 
Cooktops, ovens, and cookware heat differently, so check on your food well 
before the timer goes off, and adjust settings and cook times as needed. If your 
baked goods are browning too quickly, cover them loosely with foil to pre-
vent burning.11 A Rich Nibble of HistoryIngredients
Chicken or vegetable stock. Store-bought stocks speed up cooking in many 
dishes, from braises and stews to rice and grains. Homemade stocks will boost 
flavor—use them whenever possible.
Eggs. Sephardi recipes frequently feature eggs, but so do Ashkenazi kugels and 
Passover dishes. Use large eggs, unless otherwise noted.
Matzah. This unleavened bread, central to Passover, is eaten across traditions. 
It’s featured in several recipes, such as Matzah Brei with Lox and Dill (page 24). 
Matzah meal (ground up matzah) is used to make matzah balls and can be used in 
latkes or as a substitute for breadcrumbs.
Nuts (especially walnuts, pecans, almonds, pistachios, and pine nuts). 
Nuts are used in haroset for Passover as well as in sweets such as Mandelbrot 
(page 157). They’re also a frequent garnish.
Oil. Mediterranean Jewish cuisines use olive oil as a main cooking fat and dress-
ing, as do most of my recipes. For recipes for fried foods, keep plenty of vegetable 
oil on hand.
Onions and garlic. These ingredients figure prominently in recipes across 
Jewish cooking traditions.
Salt. These recipes were developed using Morton kosher salt. To substitute, for 
1 teaspoon of Morton kosher salt, use about 3/4 teaspoon fine table salt or about 
13/4 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt. When in doubt, start with less and 
add more to taste.
Techniques
Braising. Slow-cooking dishes over low heat (in a covered pot with liquid) was 
and is an especially important technique. It is used to cook stews overnight on 
Shabbat and helps break down tough cuts of meat, like brisket. A Dutch oven or 
other deep-sided pan, as well as a roasting pan, are excellent for braised dishes.
Frying. Many favorite Jewish foods are fried—cooked in oil over high heat—like 
potato latkes, batter-fried fish, fried chicken, falafel, and donuts. Use enough veg-
etable oil to partially or fully submerge foods. For latkes, use a heavy-bottomed 
pan, like a cast-iron skillet. For deep-frying, use a deeper pot, like a Dutch oven. A 
deep-fry or candy thermometer is helpful to keep the oil temperature in a proper 
and safe range.12 the essential Jewish CookbookMaking Ahead. In Jewish tradition, cooking is prohibited on Shabbat—the day 
of rest. As such, many traditional dishes are meant to be made ahead and enjoyed 
cold or at room temperature.
Stuffing. Jewish tradition includes many stuffed or filled foods, from cabbage 
and grape leaves to peppers and squash, to cookies and dried fruit. Stuffed foods 
often symbolize abundance and are popular on holidays, especially Sukkot.
About the Recipes
Choosing 100 recipes from thousands of years of culinary history was not an 
undertaking I took lightly. During my search for the most beloved and storied 
recipes across Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Mizrahi traditions, I reviewed a vast 
array of Jewish cookbooks, articles, and other resources. My recipes here are a 
combination of well-known dishes, foods symbolic for holidays, everyday favor-
ites, and foods that help tell parts of the Jewish story. The headnotes share a little 
of each recipe’s historical context.
To me, a recipe is “essential” when it is a thread in the larger tapestry of 
Jewish culture and cuisine. Essential recipes should also be accessible and 
appealing to modern cooks interested in Jewish food. There is so much I couldn’t 
include for lack of space, but think of these recipes as your starter set—good 
introductions to classic dishes at their very best.
I hope these recipes become reliable old friends that find their way to your 
kitchen again and again. Most recipes have manageable ingredient lists and 
straightforward preparations. Some recipes worth including require more steps 
to be their best—but don’t worry, I walk you through them. Also, the  recipes 
often include tips and shortcuts as well as labels (such as family-friendly, 
gluten-free, kosher, and vegetarian), so that you can make them to fit your own 
 preferences and tastes.
When I converted to Judaism, one aspect of Jewish life that caught my atten-
tion early on was the love of questioning, from the great Talmudic arguments to 
modern-day disagreements about the best consistency of a matzah ball. What 
I’ve counted as essential and what you count as essential might not exactly match, 
but I hope you find this collection a thought-provoking starting place for creating 
your own treasury of Jewish favorite recipes.Cheese Blintzes with Blueberry Sauce

FROM PUSHCART TO CULINAR Y 
INSTITUTION
Waves of Jewish immigrants from Germany and Eastern Europe arrived in 
America from the mid-1800s through the early twentieth century, especially 
in New York City—and they needed to eat. Jewish entrepreneurs began sell-
ing groceries and prepared foods from pushcarts and small stores, including 
old-country comforts like cured and pickled meats and fi  sh and dill pickles. The 
Jewish delicatessen, a uniquely American institution, was born—and the rest is 
culinary history.
The delicatessens and their sister stores that sold dairy goods (called 
“appetizing shops” in New York City) became social hubs and also emblems of 
Jewish culture and cuisine. Over time, many became non-kosher “Jewish-style” 
delis that sold meat and dairy products together. Several dishes with Ashkenazi 
roots became smash hits, like pastrami (a New York deli innovation) and corned 
beef sandwiches, cured and pickled fi  sh, matzah ball soup, latkes, chopped liver, 
blintzes, knishes, rugelach, and cheesecake, and even the non-kosher Reuben, a 
thick sandwich of corned beef, sauerkraut, and Swiss cheese on rye.
In recent years, renewed interest in Jewish comfort foods has bolstered 
venerable institutions—such as Katz’s Delicatessen and Russ & Daughters 
Café in New York City, and Canter’s Deli and Langer’s Delicatessen in LA—and 
has seeded a new crop of Jewish-style artisanal delis nationwide. These 
ever-evolving institutions are a treasury of what late food historian Gil Marks 
termed “American Jewish soul food.”17 Breakfast & Brunch Challah French Toast

medium heat, and stir constantly until the mixture thickens and the blue-
berries are soft, 5 to 10 minutes.
Remove from the heat, stir in the orange juice to taste and add more sugar, if 
needed. Serve warm or refrigerate and reheat when ready to use.19 Breakfast & Brunch TO MAKE THE BLINTZES
Prepare blintz pancakes, if necessary.
In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, cream cheese, cornstarch, sugar, 
cinnamon, vanilla extract, and salt until smooth.
Place one pancake browned-side up on a plate. Spoon a scant ¼    cup of fi  lling 
across the lower third in a wide ribbon, leaving a 1-inch border on the sides 
and bottom. Fold the bottom edge over the fi  lling, then fold in the sides and 
roll up to form a rectangle. Repeat with remaining pancakes. (An alternate 
method: Spoon the fi  lling in the center, tuck two sides toward the center, and 
then fold the top and bottom like an envelope.)
In a large skillet over medium-low heat, melt 1 tablespoon of butter. When 
hot, add half the blintzes in a single layer, seam-side down. Fry until golden 
brown, turning once, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining butter 
and blintzes.

Knishes—small savory or sweet ﬁ  lled pies—were popularized in the 
United States by Ashkenazi immigrants from Ukraine and Poland. A 
ﬁ  lling grab-and-go snack, knishes became a staple of delis and street 
carts. They remain a Jewish comfort food classic today, with ﬁ  llings 
ranging from cheese to sweet potato to pizza. This is my recipe for the 
enduring favorite: the potato knish. The steps take some time but are 
worth it, and you can make the knishes ahead (see tip).
FOR THE DOUGH
/one.numr⁄/two.dnom cup warm water
/one.numr⁄/two.dnom cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon white vinegar
2 /three.numr⁄/four.dnom to 3 cups all-purpose /f_l  our, plus more 
as needed
FOR THE FILLING
Extra-virgin olive oil1 /one.numr⁄/two.dnom large sweet onions, cut in half through 
the root end and thinly sliced
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2 medium russet potatoes (about 
1 /one.numr⁄/two.dnom pounds), peeled and cut into chunks
FOR BAKING
Egg wash (1 egg, lightly beaten with 
1 tablespoon cold water)
TO MAKE THE DOUGH
In a large bowl, mix together the water, oil, salt, and vinegar. Slowly add in 
23/4    cups of fl  our and stir to combine.
Knead the dough a few times in the bowl to form a smooth dough, adding 
additional fl  our as needed. Divide the dough into 2 balls, cover, and let rest 
for 30 minutes at room temperature.21 Breakfast & Brunch TO MAKE THE FILLING
Warm a layer of extra-virgin olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. 
Add the onion and season lightly with salt and pepper to taste. Toss to coat, 
cover, and cook for about 10 minutes until softened.
Reduce the heat to low, uncover, and cook 10 more minutes or until deep 
golden brown, stirring occasionally.
Meanwhile, put the potatoes in a large saucepan and add water to cover by 
1 inch. Salt the water and bring to a boil. Simmer, partially covered, until 
tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and mash, seasoning with additional 
salt and pepper.
Combine the potatoes and onions. Set aside.
TO MAKE THE KNISHES
Preheat the oven to 400°F and line a large sheet pan with parchment paper.
Working with one dough ball at a time, on a lightly fl  oured surface (or 
between two sheets of wax paper) roll the dough approximately 1/8 inch thick. 
Use a 23/4   -inch biscuit cutter or drinking glass to cut into rounds.
Place a scant 1 tablespoon of fi  lling in the center of each round. Fold up the 
sides, pinching to close. Reroll the dough scraps and repeat.
Place the knishes seam-side down on the sheet pan. Brush the tops with egg 
wash and bake until golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room 
temperature.
/m.sc/a.sc/k.sc/e.sc /a.sc/h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/d.sc /t.sc/i.sc/p.sc: Freeze the baked and cooled knishes and reheat as needed. 
Bake at 375°F, loosely covered with foil, 15 to 20 minutes or until hot.22 the essential Jewish CookbookShakshuka (Eggs Poached

Shakshuka’s origins are disputed, but it is common in North African 
cuisines and was likely brought to Israel by Tunisian Jews. Recipes 
vary, but this straightforward version is vibrant in color and fl  avor—
don’t forget some bread to mop up all the sauce and yolks.

Make 6 wells in the sauce, and break an egg into each well. Sprinkle the eggs 
with black pepper and loosely cover the pan with foil or a lid. Cook until the 
eggs are cooked to preference, 5 to 10 minutes.
Remove from the heat, let rest several minutes, and serve with a dollop of

Bourekas are a mouthwatering Sephardi melding of Spanish empana-
das and Turkish borek that emerged from Jewish life in the Ottoman 
Empire. Today, these pastry turnovers are immensely popular in Israel 
in a range of doughs and ﬁ  llings—especially savory ﬁ  llings like potato, 
cheese, or spinach. Sweet ﬁ  llings are less traditional but equally 
crowd-pleasing for brunch or dessert. Here’s my deliciously easy 
blueberry-cheese version using store-bought puff   pastry. 
1 sheet frozen store-bought puﬀ   pastry
About /two.numr⁄/three.dnom cup blueberry preserves5 ounces cream cheese, divided 
into 9 pieces
Cooking spray
Thaw puff   pastry according to package instructions (usually around 
15 minutes).
Preheat the oven to 400°F and line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
On a lightly fl  oured surface, roll the pastry into a 9-by-9-inch square. Cut 
into 9 squares and roll each square to about 5-by-5 inches.
Place 2½    heaping teaspoons of preserves in the middle of each square and 
top with 1 piece of cream cheese (slightly fl  attened).
Dampen the outer pastry edges with water and fold the dough over the fi  lling 
to make a triangle. Pinch the ends fi  rmly and crimp the edges with a fork.
Transfer the bourekas to the sheet pan, gently pierce the tops with a fork to 
allow steam to escape, and lightly coat with cooking spray.
Bake for 15 minutes, until puff  y and golden. Cool slightly before serving.24 the essential Jewish CookbookMatzah Brei with Lox and Dill

Matzah brei (pronounced like “fry”) is softened matzah coated with 
eggs and then fried. The ﬁ  nished result falls somewhere between an 
omelet and a pancake. This Ashkenazi comfort food—prepared both 
sweet and savory—is a popular Passover breakfast. My savory version 
is garnished with two classics of Ashkenazi cuisine: lox and dill.
4 large sheets matzah, broken into 2- to 
3-inch pieces
3 cups boiling water
4 eggs, lightly beaten
Freshly ground black pepper
Kosher salt2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 ounces lox or smoked salmon, sliced 
into 1-inch slivers, for garnish
1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill, 
for garnish
Place the matzah in a colander in the sink. Slowly pour the boiling water over 
the matzah to soften it, shaking the colander to drain.
In a large bowl, combine the matzah, eggs, and pepper to taste. Salt only 
lightly, since lox is salty. Let sit for 2 to 4 minutes, until the matzah is no 
longer crisp.
In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter. When 
foaming subsides, add the matzah mixture and cook, turning frequently, 
until the eggs are just set. Serve immediately, garnished with lox and dill.
/v.sc/a.sc/r.sc/i.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc /t.sc/i.sc/p.sc: For a sweet version, omit the black pepper, lox, and dill and 
 garnish instead with cinnamon sugar or fruit preserves.25 Breakfast & Brunch Pear and Mango Compote 
with Honey

Fragrant fruit compotes were part of the Ashkenazi culinary reper-
toire in Europe, and today they make regular appearances at holiday 
meals or as side dishes. My light and refreshing version omits the typ-
ical prunes and raisins in favor of lusciously sweet pears and mango 
(now a popular fruit in Israel). Serve alongside Cheese Blintzes with 
Blueberry Sauce (page 18) or Challah French Toast (page 17).
3 pears, peeled, cored, and sliced
1 mango, peeled, pitted, and cubed (about 
1 /one.numr⁄/two.dnom cups)
1 cup green grapes
/one.numr⁄/four.dnom cup dried cranberries/one.numr⁄/two.dnom tablespoon freshly squeezed 
lemon juice
1 /one.numr⁄/two.dnom cups dry white wine, like Pinot Grigio
/one.numr⁄/four.dnom cup honey
In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the pears, mango, 
grapes, cranberries, lemon juice, wine, and honey. Add enough water to cover 
most of the fruit and bring to a boil.
Once boiling, reduce to a simmer and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, 
until fruit is tender, about 20 minutes. Transfer only the fruit (not the liquid) 
to a bowl and set aside.
Return the remaining liquid to medium-high heat and boil until reduced 
by about half and slightly syrupy, about 10 minutes. Pour the syrup over the 
fruit and chill 6 hours or overnight. Refrigerate, covered, for up to 3 days.
/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc/r.sc/e.sc/d.sc/i.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc /t.sc/i.sc/p.sc: The white wine adds acidity and fl  avor, but you won’t get buzzed 
eating this dish. A�ter dilution with water and evaporation of more than half the 
wine’s 5 to 14 percent alcohol content during cooking, very little alcohol remains 
in a serving. If preferred though, substitute non-alcoholic white wine or white 
grape juice.26 the essential Jewish CookbookSpicy Sabich with

Sabich, introduced to Israel by way of Iraqi Jews, is a sandwich made 
by combining traditional Iraqi breakfast dishes in pita or laff  a. Typ-
ical ﬁ  llings include eggplant, Israeli chopped salad, tahini sauce or 
hummus, hard-boiled eggs, and a chutney or sauce, like zhug. Although 
the eggplant is typically fried, I prefer roasting it, which is easier and 
produces a deeper fl  avor .
2 medium eggplants
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive 
oil, divided
1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more 
to taste
2 tomatoes
1 small cucumber, peeled
/one.numr⁄/two.dnom teaspoon red wine vinegarFreshly ground black pepper

6 hard-boiled eggs (ideally Huevos 
Haminados, page 28), sliced
/one.numr⁄/two.dnom cup Hummus (page 55)
Zhug (page 63) or harissa
Preheat the oven to 400°F . Line a sheet pan with foil.
Trim the eggplants into thick strips, about 4 inches long and ½    inch thick 
(like thick-cut fries).
Toss the eggplant slices with 2½    tablespoons olive oil to coat and 
sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of salt. Transfer to the sheet pan and roast 
about 30 minutes or until tender and lightly browned, turning once 
halfway through.
Meanwhile, chop the tomatoes and cucumber. Toss with the remaining 
½    tablespoon olive oil, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste.27 Breakfast & Brunch Once the eggplant is done, warm the pitas in the oven at 350°F for 
about 10 minutes.
To assemble the sandwiches, halve and open the pitas. Spoon in the egg-
plant, tomato and cucumber salad, and eggs. Top with hummus and zhug or 
harissa to taste.

When Sephardi Jews made overnight stews (hamin) for Shabbat, 
they nestled whole eggs in their shells into the pot to cook alongside 
the stew. The eggs emerged deeply browned, their insides laced with 
the fl  avor of the stew—faintly nutty with notes of bitter caramel. This 
slow-cooker version recreates this unique fl  avor . Serve plain, or in 
Spicy Sabich with Roasted Eggplant (page 26), during Passover .

With just a few ingredients, this almost puff   pastry–like fl  atbread is 
an irresistibly delicious hallmark of Yemenite Jewish cuisine, popular 
in Israel today. The skillet-cooked bread has multiple steps, but don’t 
be intimidated—you’ll get the hang of it. To make this dish quick for 
breakfast, roll the dough ahead of time (see recipe tip for storage).
4 cups all-purpose /f_l  our
1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more 
for tomatoes
1 teaspoon sugar
1 cup warm water1 stick unsalted butter, room 
temperature, cut into 10 chunks
2 large tomatoes
Freshly ground black pepper
In a large bowl, whisk together the fl  our, salt, and sugar. Slowly mix in the 
warm water, kneading until a mostly smooth, dense dough ball forms. If 
needed, add more water a teaspoon at a time.
Divide and roll the dough into 8 balls. Place them on a sheet pan lined with 
parchment paper, cover, and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Grease a smooth work surface with a chunk of butter. Place a dough ball on 
the buttered surface and roll it into a roughly 6-by-9-inch rectangle. Use 
your hands to continue pulling the dough until paper thin (small tears are 
okay), roughly 10 by 12 inches.
Rub a second chunk of butter over the dough. Roll the dough up from its long 
edge to form a rope. Coil the rope into a pinwheel (like a cinnamon roll) and 
return it to the sheet pan.
Repeat with the remaining dough balls, re-buttering the work surface 
 frequently. Cover the coiled dough balls and refrigerate for 30 minutes.31 Breakfast & Brunch Meanwhile, shred the tomatoes using the large holes on a box grater. Season 
with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
Remove the coiled dough from the refrigerator. Use your palm to fl  atten one 
coil, then place it between two sheets of wax paper and roll into a roughly 
8-inch circle. Repeat with remaining dough.
Warm a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Once hot, fry the 
rounds, one at a time, until golden (1 to 2 minutes per side). Serve warm, 
topped with tomato.

AUBERGINE
If ever there were an essential Jewish fruit, the eggplant would be it. (Though we 
o�ten treat it like a vegetable, it’s technically a berry.) Jewish recipe collections 
o�ten feature a wide variety of preparations with eggplant. Being able to cook 
eggplant multiple ways was legendarily a point of pride for Jewish cooks. You 
might fi  nd eggplant fried, roasted, mashed, stewed, stuff  ed, and even lightly 
sweetened or made into a jam.
Eggplants are native to southeast Asia and were cultivated in India for thou-
sands of years. They entered Jewish cuisine around the ninth century a�ter the 
fruit traveled west when Muslim rule expanded into Europe. Jews in Spain and 
Sicily especially prized eggplant for its meaty texture and versatility. Europeans 
later referred to it as the “Jewish apple.”
So strong was the association that during the Spanish Inquisition, a pref-
erence for eggplant would raise the suspicions of inquisitors trying to root out 
Jews. A�ter the Spanish expulsion in 1492, Sephardi and Sicilian Jews moved into 
Italy and beyond, carrying eggplant recipes with them. Thanks in part to this, 
the eggplant today shines in Jewish culinary traditions from the Mediterranean 
through North Africa.37 Salads & SidesClassic Potato Latkes

Latkes—fried potato pancakes—are a beloved Ashkenazi food, espe-
cially for Hanukkah. Long ago, cheese pancakes reigned for the 
holiday, but once potatoes became a staple of the Eastern European 
diet in the mid-1800s, crisp-tender potato pancakes served with 
sour cream or applesauce became the iconic favorite. Here’s my

Haroset is symbolic for Passover—the fl  avorful fruit-and-nut mixture 
represents the mortar used by Israelites enslaved in Egypt. (It tastes 
nothing like cement—I promise.) Classic Ashkenazi versions, like this 
one, use sweet fruit, wine, nuts, and warm spices. Honey is a tradi-
tional sweetener , but I ﬁ  nd it’s usually sweet enough without it.

Haroset recipes from North Africa and the Middle East often use 
warm spices and dried fruit, especially dates, which are native to the 
region and have symbolic signiﬁ  cance in the Hebrew Bible. The dried 
fruit brings sweet, intense fl  avor and creates a sticky texture, making 
the haroset ideal for rolling into candy-like balls. They are festive for 
entertaining and simply fun to eat.

Parsley and mint are the stars of tabbouleh, which is popular all over 
the Middle East. Lebanese recipes use minimal bulgur , whereas this 
heftier version gained traction in Israel and the United States. No 
matter how much bulgur you use, though, tabbouleh’s bright herbal 
fl  avor always shines through. To make gluten-free, Passover-friendly 
tabbouleh, substitute 3 to 4 cups of cooked quinoa for the bulgur .

½    inch. Let stand until bulgur is tender but still somewhat chewy, about 
25 minutes. Drain any excess water.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the tomatoes, scallions, 
 parsley, and mint.
To make the dressing, in a separate small bowl, whisk together the lemon 
juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper.
Add the bulgur to the parsley mixture. Toss gently with dressing  just to coat

Italian Jews developed their own cuisine, and their most famous dish, 
still found throughout Italy today, is deep-fried artichokes. Although 
they are often served whole, halving them makes preparation easier . 
To ensure crispy and delicate fried artichokes, thoroughly remove all 
the tough parts before frying.
4 medium to large artichokes
Vegetable oil, for fryingKosher salt
Prepare the artichokes. Cut the stem to about 1 inch and remove the dark 
leaves—about fi  ve layers’ worth—until you reach pliable, light-green leaves. 
Cut off   the top half of the leaves; then use a sharp knife to shave off   leaf stubs 
around the base and the outer stem. Finally, halve the artichoke lengthwise 
and remove the thistly center leaves. Discard all trimmings.
Fill a large pot with a steamer basket with 2 inches of water and bring to 
a boil. Add the halved artichokes and steam, covered, until tender when 
pierced, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove and discard the fuzzy center chokes. Set 
steamed artichokes aside.
In a large Dutch oven on the stovetop, heat about 2 inches of oil to 350°F .
Once the oil is hot, tap the artichokes gently to separate their leaves. Gently 
drop four halves into the oil (being careful of spatters). Use tongs to submerge 
as fully as possible. Fry until browned and crisp, 3 to 6 minutes.
Remove to a paper towel–lined plate and repeat with the remaining halves.
Sprinkle with kosher salt to taste. Serve hot.44 the essential Jewish CookbookMaple, Carrot, and Sweet

54 the essential Jewish CookbookCHICKEN SOUP: A PRICELESS 
POT OF GOLD
Jewish chicken soup, goldene yoich (in Yiddish, “golden broth”), is legendary. 
Although Jews weren’t the fi  rst to make it, they’ve done a lot to celebrate and 
popularize it. Picking up on Chinese observations of the simple soup’s medicinal 
and healing qualities, the twel�th-century Jewish scholar (and doctor) Moses 
Maimonides recommended chicken soup for anyone feeling weak or sick and 
for women who had just given birth. We have him in large part to thank for the 
concept of chicken soup as “Jewish Penicillin.”
Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews have made versions of chicken soup since at 
least medieval times. Once chickens became more widely available in Europe 
in the fi  �teenth century, chicken soup took off   in Ashkenazi Jewish communities, 
becoming a Sabbath, holiday, and wedding staple served with noodles, kreplach,

arrived in America.
Although the basic approach remains similar, recipes vary among cultures. 
For example, Persian versions include turmeric and chickpea dumplings, and 
Indian versions o�ten feature ginger and cardamom. According to food histo-
rian Joan Nathan, Yemenite Jews might have the oldest chicken soup recipe in 
 existence—their spicy version includes garlic, fenugreek, and chiles. No matter 
how it’s made, chicken soup is a humble basic that reigns as one of Jewish 
 cuisine’s greatest culinary riches.55 Spreads & SoupsHummus

Long before hummus became a ubiquitous food in Israel and around 
the world, cooks across the Middle East and North Africa were 
making it with fava beans or chickpeas as part of mezzes. Its origins 
remain hotly debated, but the ﬁ  rst known mention of it appears in a 
cookbook from thirteenth-century Cairo. Hummus is easy to prepare 
at home, especially using canned beans. Of countless variations, this 
basic version remains my favorite. Serve with Pita Bread (page 149) or 
vegetable sticks.
1 (15.5-ounce) can chickpeas, drained 
with liquid reserved

In a blender, process the chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, salt, 
pepper, and 1/3 cup of the reserved chickpea liquid. Continue processing, 
adding chickpea liquid as needed until smooth and creamy. Season to taste 
and chill, covered, until ready to serve.
Toast the pine nuts in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, 
5 to 7 minutes or until lightly browned.
To serve, spoon the hummus into a wide, fl  at bowl, making a slight indent in 
the center. Sprinkle with paprika, drizzle olive oil into the indent, and top 
with pine nuts.

Eggplant was cooked in many ways across the Mediterranean and 
Middle East, but among the most popular preparations (among 
Jews and non-Jews alike) were mashed eggplant spreads like baba 
ghanoush. Israeli Jews adopted baba ghanoush from neighboring

Colorful bell peppers have long been favorites for mezzes and savored 
in spreads like this one of Turkish and Syrian origins. Here, roasted 
peppers create rich texture and fl  avor , accentuated by the typical 
ingredients of walnuts, breadcrumbs, and pomegranate molasses. Use 
as a dip for bread or vegetables, or as a condiment.

Native to Eastern Europe, horseradish was adopted as the “bitter 
herb” on the Passover Seder plate, despite being neither bitter nor an 
herb. Eastern European Jews also found that pungent chrain (horse-
radish paste) was an ideal complement for mild geﬁ  lte ﬁ  sh. Here, beets 
add vibrant color and help mellow the bite—but a small spoonful still 
goes a long way.

Apples feature in dishes for many Jewish holidays—they symbolize 
a sweet new year on Rosh Hashanah and are used in many Passover 
harosets. On Hanukkah, applesauce is served as a condiment for 
latkes—but it makes a fresh, palate-pleasing side dish almost any-
time. This applesauce is easy to make and far superior to anything 
store-bought. Since apples vary in sweetness, be sure to taste after 
cooking and adjust sugar and cinnamon to your preference.
3 to 4 large apples (about 3 pounds), 
such as Honeycrisp, peeled and

In Ashkenazi tradition, chopped liver on bread or crackers has been 
a Shabbat and holiday appetizer for centuries. This modest update 
brightens fl  avor with olive oil, a splash of vinegar , and a fl  aky sea salt 
garnish. For a traditional chunky texture, chop the ingredients by hand.

Warm a layer of oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onion 
and season with salt and pepper to taste. Toss to coat, cover, and cook until 
softened, about 10 minutes.
Adjust heat to low, uncover, and cook the onion until deep golden brown, 
about 10 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the vinegar and transfer 
the mixture to a food processor or bowl. Set aside.
Add the livers to the skillet in a single layer, adding oil as needed and sea-
soning with salt and pepper to taste. Fry until lightly browned and cooked 
through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a food processor.
Process or chop the mixture until it reaches your desired consistency. Fold in 
3/4    of the eggs, adding oil as needed to achieve desired consistency. Cover and 
chill at least two hours or overnight.

the sauce—which features cilantro, chiles, and cumin—to Israel in the 
early twentieth century. Today it’s become something of a national 
condiment. Serve with Falafel (page 88), in Pita Bread (page 149), or

is za’atar , a spice blend widely popular in Israel and now available at 
many major supermarkets in the United States. In this recipe, za’atar , 
chives, and toasted garlic transform labneh into a palate-pleasing, 
super-quick dip for Pita Bread (page 149) or sliced vegetables.

The matzah ball is an icon of Jewish cooking, but it has humble 
 beginnings—it emerged when Ashkenazi cooks used matzah meal 
instead of fl  our to make kosher-for-Passover dumplings (knaidlach). 
Today, matzah ball soup plays a starring role at many Passover feasts 
and year-round at Jewish delis as an ultimate comfort food. Using 
schmaltz (chicken fat) is traditional, but olive oil works beautifully—
and is healthier—for this fl  uff  y-but-still-ﬁ  rm recipe.

Creamy, hearty mushroom-barley soup (also known as krupnik) was 
originally commonplace in Poland, Lithuania, and Ukraine. Ash-
kenazi Jews brought it to America, where it became a comforting 
regular at delis and at home. Some versions include meat, but this one 
lets mushrooms do the work, with a little help from the modern addi-
tion of Worcestershire sauce.
1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms
1 cup boiling water
Extra-virgin olive oil
1 large onion, chopped
2 ribs celery, /f_i  nely chopped
2 medium carrots, /f_i  nely chopped
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper1 pound mixed fresh mushrooms (prefer-
ably shiitake and cremini), chopped into 
roughly /one.numr⁄/two.dnom-inch pieces
4 garlic cloves, minced
8 cups water
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
/one.numr⁄/two.dnom cup pearl barley
In a small bowl, cover the dried porcini mushrooms in the boiling water. Let 
stand 10 minutes. Strain through a coff  ee fi  lter, reserving the liquid. Rinse 
and chop the rehydrated mushrooms.
Heat a layer of oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, 
and carrot. Season lightly with salt and pepper to taste. Cook until softened, 
stirring frequently, about 8 minutes.
Add in the fresh mushrooms and rehydrated porcinis. Season with salt and 
pepper to taste and cook until mushrooms soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in 
the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute.71 Spreads & SoupsAdd the 8 cups of water, the reserved mushroom liquid, Worcestershire 
sauce, and barley. Adjust the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil.
Reduce the heat to low, and simmer partially covered, 50 to 60 minutes or 
until the barley is tender, stirring occasionally. Season to taste and serve hot.

For a fragrantly spiced and wonderfully ﬁ  lling soup, turn to this 
beef version from Yemenite Jewish cuisine. Commonly prepared for 
 Shabbat, the soup gets fl  avor from generous amounts of cumin, tur-
meric, cardamom, and black pepper (often blended in the traditional 
spice mixture called hawaij). Serve topped with a spoonful of  Zhug 
(page 63) and bread for dipping.
Extra-virgin olive oil
1 pound beef chuck or stew beef, cut into 
1-inch chunks
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2 large onions, chopped
6 cloves garlic, slivered
2 teaspoons ground cumin1 teaspoon ground cardamom
2 teaspoons ground turmeric
3 tablespoons tomato paste
7 cups beef stock or water
4 Yukon Gold potatoes (about 1 pound), 
peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
/one.numr⁄/two.dnom cup chopped cilantro
Heat a thin layer of oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add 
the meat, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Cook, turning occasionally, 
until browned, about 8 minutes. Remove and set aside.
Add in the onion and season lightly with salt and pepper. Cook until softened, 
about 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the garlic, cumin, cardamom, and 
turmeric and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
Return the meat to the pot, stir in the tomato paste, and add the stock or 
water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a low simmer, skimming off   any 
foam that rises to the top. Cover partially and cook until the meat is tender, 
about 1½    hours.73 Spreads & SoupsAdd the potatoes to the soup and simmer, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes or

Jewel-toned, sweet-and-sour beet soup was likely adopted by 
 Ashkenazi Jews in what are now Russia, Ukraine, and Lithuania. 
Its popularity soared in America so much that borscht became com-
mercially produced in jars. Meat-based borscht is served hot, but 
vegetarian borscht (like this recipe) can be served hot or cold, with 
sour cream added as desired. 
6 to 8 medium beets, peeled and

Stir in the sugar, lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste. Simmer 
5 more minutes.

Long ago, meaty-fl  eshed winter squash—close in fl  avor to today’s 
butternut squash—made its way into Jewish soups, hand pies, purees, 
and rice dishes worldwide, in part by way of Sephardi Jews migrating 
from the Iberian Peninsula. Today, silky, rich butternut squash soup 
has become a popular addition to Shabbat dinners and Jewish holi-
day dinners in autumn.
2 (12-ounce) containers (about 6 to 
7 cups) pre-cut butternut squash cubes

Combine the squash, shallots, sugar, salt, and pepper to taste directly on the 
sheet pan. Lightly coat with oil and spread in a single layer. Roast until tender, 
25 to 35 minutes, turning occasionally.
In a large pot, warm a layer of oil over medium heat. Add the ginger and 
sauté for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add 3½    cups of broth, along with the 
roasted vegetables and their juices. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low 
and simmer for 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are very tender. Puree 
with an immersion blender or in batches in a blender. Add the remaining 
broth or water as needed to reach desired consistency.

In any Jewish tradition, there’s one thing you’ll always fi  nd: matzah. Though 
short on fl  avor, this unleavened “loaf” carries a lot of historical weight on its 
brittle frame. Matzah commemorates the exodus from Egypt, when enslaved 
Israelites fl  ed before their breads could rise—and it plays a starring role during 
Passover, when Jews honor the story of the exodus by avoiding leavened bread 
for eight days.
Most of us know matzah as the square, dry boards boxed and sold in stores. 
Commercial production ensures matzah is kosher for Passover, following all 
the rules about the harvesting and milling of the wheat as well as the baking (no 
more than 18 minutes can pass between mixing and baking, to prevent any pos-
sible fermentation or rising). Matzah can actually vary in shape and doesn’t have 
to be hard—historically, and in some Mizrahi and Sephardi communities today, 
matzah is so�t.
Dry and relatively fl  avorless matzah has spurred Jewish cooks to get cre-
ative. It’s o�ten ground into meal and used in coatings and fritters as well as 
dumplings (matzah balls!). It’s coated in eggs and fried in matzah brei. Farfel, or 
crumbled matzah, is used in stuffi   ngs and kugels. There are Sephardi layered 
matzah pies and playful innovations like matzah “lasagna” (both included in 
this chapter).
As one of the best-known biblical foods, matzah serves as a power-
ful symbol of shared history, as well as a signature ingredient across Jewish 
 culinary traditions.79 Vegetarian MainsCheesy Stuﬀ  ed Tomatoes

Jewish cuisine overfl  ows with stuff  ed vegetables (dolmas), whether

Lahmajin (“meat with dough”) are popular fl  atbreads in Armenian, 
Turkish, and Syrian cuisine, as well as in Israel. They are usually 
topped with ground lamb or beef, but this Jewish vegetarian adap-
tation with a lentil topping tastes splendidly earthy and just as 
sensational. This recipe is adapted from Gil Marks’s recipe in Olive 
Trees and Honey.
1 package store-bought pizza dough
1 cup brown lentils, cooked according to

Because of Shabbat prohibitions on cooking, Jews in Italy centuries 
ago may have been among the ﬁ  rst to eat cold pasta dishes. These 
 precursors to pasta salad were eaten with cold tomato or lemon 
sauces. In a modern take on that tradition, here’s a pasta salad featur-

Cook the pasta according to package instructions.
While the pasta cooks, make the dressing. In a medium bowl, whisk together 
the lemon juice, vinegar, olive oil, salt, pepper, red pepper fl  akes, and oregano.
Once cooked, drain the pasta and transfer it to a large bowl. Stir in the fennel, 
celery, bell pepper, beans, and basil. Toss with just enough dressing to coat, 
reserving the rest. Cover and chill at least 1 hour. Season to taste, adding

Handheld pastry turnovers are found throughout historical  Sephardi 
and Mizrahi Jewish regions—consider bourekas, empanadas, and 
samosas. Perhaps one of the earliest of these—sambousak—comes 
from what is now Iraq, where chickpea ﬁ  llings became a Jewish spe-
cialty. Originally deep-fried, the half-moon–shaped sambousak are 
now usually baked and make regular appearances for Hanukkah, 
Shavuot, and Purim meals.

10 store-bought empanada wrappers
1 egg yolk, lightly beaten with 1 teaspoon 
cold water, or olive oil cooking spray
Sesame seeds for sprinkling
Preheat the oven to 375°F and line a large sheet pan with parchment paper.
Heat the olive oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 
the onion and season lightly with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 
for 3 to 5 minutes or until softened. Add the cumin and turmeric and cook 
for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat, stir in the chickpeas, 
and add salt and pepper to taste.
Lay the wrappers on a fl  at work surface. Spoon 2 tablespoons of fi  lling into 
the center of each wrapper. Fold the wrappers over to make half-moons, 
pressing fi  rmly and crimping the edges with a fork.
Transfer the sambousak to the sheet pan, brush with egg wash, and sprinkle 
with sesame seeds. Bake until golden, about 20 minutes. Serve warm or at

9596 the essential Jewish CookbookTAKING IT SLOW
It was a uniquely Jewish culinary challenge: How does one have a hot meal on 
Saturday a�ternoon when Shabbat observance prohibits cooking for 24 hours 
a�ter sundown on Friday? The answer has become a hallmark of Jewish cooking 
worldwide—the long-simmered, one-pot stew.
Two millennia ago, Jews in the Middle East turned a regional grain por-
ridge into an overnight stew called harisa, adding meat and sometimes onions. 
Later on, Sephardi Jews in Spain added in beans, eggs, and more water. It 
became known as hamin (Hebrew for “hot”) or adafi  na or dafi  na (Arabic for 
“buried”). Those stews went on to become the cholents of Ashkenazi Jews in 
France (possibly inspiring the French cassoulet) and Germany, which o�ten 
used the only cuts of meat the Jews of the time could aff  ord: brisket and short 
ribs. Slow-cooking suited the fatty, tough cuts perfectly and helped establish 
their enduring association with Jewish cuisine. The overnight bean-and-
meat stew spread, morphing into versions with cumin in Morocco or garam 
masala in India.
Slow-cooking inspired more than just lasting dishes. In America, inventor 
Irving Nachumsohn, remembering his grandmother’s tales of taking her cholent 
to the public bakery in Lithuania (since no one had private ovens), thought of a 
fi  x. He invented an electric appliance that allowed for slow simmering, and in 
1940 the precursor to today’s Crock-Pot was born.
Stews nowadays aren’t usually cooked overnight, but the legacy of the 
technique lives on, featured prominently and deliciously in the Jewish culi-
nary repertoire.97 Chicken, Meat & FishLemon-Garlic Roast Chicken

By way of its frequent and celebrated presence at Shabbat dinners 
starting in the twentieth century, roast chicken has become central 
to the Jewish culinary repertoire. Simple fl  avors like lemon, garlic, 
rosemary, and other herbs are all this dish needs to feel comforting but 
special, especially when drizzled with fl  avor-packed pan juices.

Rub the chicken all over with half of a lemon and the smashed garlic cloves. 
Season liberally with kosher salt and black pepper to taste. Place the rose-
mary sprigs, another lemon half, and any remaining garlic in the chicken’s 
cavity. Truss the chicken if preferred, but it’s not necessary.
Place the chicken breast-side up in an oven-safe skillet or roasting pan. Place 
the remaining lemon halves on either side of the chicken and drizzle with oil.
Roast until browned and cooked through, 40 to 60 minutes—the thickest 
part of the thigh should read 165°F .
Remove the pan from the oven and tent it with foil. Let it rest for 20 minutes. 
Drizzle the chicken with juices combined with chopped garlic pieces from 
the pan and serve warm.

Fried chicken? This might not seem like a Jewish dish at ﬁ  rst glance, 
but it was widely prepared among Italy’s Jewish community— 
especially for Hanukkah, when Jews eat foods fried in oil. Traditional 
preparations include a lemon marinade with warm spices, like cinna-
mon and nutmeg. To fry safely, use a deep-fry thermometer to monitor 
the temperature of the oil.
FOR THE MARINATED CHICKEN
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
/one.numr⁄/four.dnom cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
/one.numr⁄/two.dnom teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon garlic powder

In a bowl or large resealable bag, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, nutmeg, 
garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Add the chicken and stir or turn to coat.
Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 3 hours, stirring or turning a few times.
TO MAKE THE CHICKEN
In a wide, shallow bowl, whisk together the fl  our, garlic powder, salt, black 
pepper, and cayenne pepper. Dredge the chicken pieces fi  rst in the fl  our mix-
ture, then in the eggs—the traditional method—and set aside on a plate.99 Chicken, Meat & FishIn a large Dutch oven or other heavy deep-sided pan over medium-high heat, 
bring about 2½    inches of oil to 375°F .
Working in batches, slide the coated pieces into the oil. Adjust the burner 
continuously to keep the oil temperature around 325°F . Fry the chicken, 
turning occasionally, until golden and an instant-read thermometer inserted 
into the thickest part of each piece registers 165°F (10 to 15 minutes).
As they fi  nish, transfer the fried chicken pieces to a paper towel–lined plate.

cooked in a clay pot seasoned liberally with the chile-based spice 
blend berbere. Ethiopian Jews cooked versions of this ﬁ  ery, fragrant 
dish for Sabbath dinner , substituting oil for the typical ghee. Serve 
with rice or bread.
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 large yellow onions, /f_i  nely chopped
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger2 tablespoons berbere
1 4-pound chicken, cut into 8 or 10 pieces 
(by a butcher)
1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste
1 cup chicken broth or water
Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or other deep-sided pan over medium 
heat. Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring fre-
quently, for 3 to 5 minutes or until softened.
Add the garlic, ginger, and berbere and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
Adjust the heat to medium-high. Add the chicken and lightly sear both sides, 
about 3 minutes. Combine the tomato paste and broth and stir into the pan.
Cover and reduce the heat to low. Simmer, stirring occasionally, about 
30 minutes. Uncover and cook 20 to 30 more minutes, until the sauce 
thickens and the chicken is tender and cooked through. (An instant-read 
thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh should read 165°F .) Let 
rest, loosely covered, for a few minutes before serving.

Brisket, once considered an undesirable, tough cut of beef, was 
 historically what poor Ashkenazi Eastern European Jews could 
aff  ord. Cooking it low and slow made it tender and fl  avorful, and soon 
brisket became a base for cholents and tzimmes and a frequent holi-
day centerpiece. Make this fruity and robust version ahead. Allowing 
it to cool overnight makes it easier to trim the fat and slice it; plus, 
rewarming the brisket brings out its best fl  avor .
1 5-pound brisket, ideally with about a 
/one.numr⁄/four.dnom-inch layer of fat
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2 large yellow onions, halved and sliced
3 garlic cloves, halved1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes 
with juices
1 sprig fresh rosemary, plus additional for 
optional garnish
1 /one.numr⁄/two.dnom cups dry red wine
/one.numr⁄/two.dnom cup beef stock or broth
1 tablespoon tomato paste
Preheat the oven to 325°F .
In a large skillet over high heat, brown the brisket on both sides, about 
12 minutes. Season generously with salt and pepper to taste.
Place the onion, garlic, tomatoes, and rosemary sprig in a large roasting pan. 
Place the brisket on top, fat-side up. Pour the red wine, stock, and tomato 
paste on top. Cover with aluminum foil.
Roast for 3½    to 5 hours, or until the meat is fork-tender, basting a few times.
Transfer the meat to a dish, cover with a few spoonfuls of the cooking liquid 
(reserving the rest), and cool slightly. Cover and refrigerate overnight.105 Chicken, Meat & FishStrain and set the cooking liquids aside, reserving the solids. Cover and 
refrigerate the sauce and vegetables separately overnight.
The next day, skim most of the fat from the sauce, stirring in the rest. Trim 
the fatty layer from the brisket and slice the meat against the grain. Place the 
slices in a baking dish and spoon a little more sauce over the top. Cover with 
foil and reheat at 350°F until hot, 30 to 40 minutes. 
Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the 
remaining sauce to a boil. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes until reduced by 
about half. 
Coarsely chop about 1 cup of the reserved garlic, onion, and tomatoes, and stir 
into the sauce to warm.
Transfer the brisket to a platter and arrange the chopped vegetables and 
sauce around it, reserving the rest of the sauce to pass around the table. 
Garnish with chopped rosemary (if using), and serve warm.
/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc/r.sc/e.sc/d.sc/i.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc /t.sc/i.sc/p.sc: Give yourself leeway when making brisket, because cooking 
time will vary with the thickness and fattiness of the meat. Thinner cuts take 
around 31⁄2 hours, but thicker, fattier cuts can take 5 hours or longer.106 the essential Jewish CookbookMeatballs in Tomato Sauce

Meatballs (albondigas) have been a part of Jewish cuisine dating back 
centuries, when they were cooked by Sephardi Jews who adopted 
them from Spain’s Muslim rulers. Meatballs became regulars on 
Shabbat and holiday tables, often made with lamb and typically 
served plain or with vinegar or lemon sauces until tomatoes became 
widely available. Here, cinnamon refl  ects the Middle Eastern heritage 
and adds warmth to the sauce. Serve traditional style, over rice.

MAKE THE MEATBALLS
Soak the white bread in water and then squeeze it to remove excess. 
(It should still be moist.)
In a large bowl, combine the meat, bread, egg, onion, salt, pepper, and parsley. 
Form into 1½   -inch balls.
In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm the oil. Add the meat-
balls in a single layer, working in batches if needed. Fry until mostly browned, 
turning once or twice, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate.107 Chicken, Meat & FishMAKE THE SAUCE
Add the onions to the still-hot pan, season with salt and pepper, and cook

Adaﬁ  na (also known as daﬁ  na or d’ﬁ  na) is a slow-cooked Shabbat 
stew with origins in North Africa. Its basic building blocks include 
beans, meat, onions, potatoes, garlic, cumin, and whole eggs—other 
ingredients and spices vary by region and even by family. The tra-
ditional cut of beef is often fl  anken (short ribs cut across the bone), 
but boneless short ribs are easier to ﬁ  nd and work well for this 
slow-cooker preparation.
2 (15.5 ounce) cans chickpeas, drained 
and rinsed
2 large yellow onions, coarsely chopped
6 garlic cloves, smashed
15 to 18 baby (two-bite size) Yukon Gold 
potatoes, unpeeled

In a large slow cooker, combine the chickpeas, onions, garlic, potatoes, and 
beef. Nestle the eggs (still in their shells) on top.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the broth, salt, pepper, turmeric, cumin, 
and allspice and add to the slow cooker.
Cover and cook on the high setting for 1 hour, then on the low setting for 10 to 
11 hours, or until meat is tender.
Just before serving, skim any fat from the surface. Remove and peel the eggs

You’ve got to love a dish with the Yiddish name “galooptchy.” And 
indeed, galooptchy—stuff  ed cabbage leaves in rich tomato sauce—are 
beloved in Ashkenazi cooking. This version gets its tenderness from 
ground turkey (which holds moisture better than the usual ground 
beef) and extra fl  avor from garlic powder and fennel seeds. Freezing 
the cabbage overnight softens the leaves for easy wrapping.

Preheat the oven to 375°F .
In a medium bowl, combine the tomato sauce, basil, sugar, ½    teaspoon of 
the kosher salt, and pepper to taste. Spread a thin layer of this sauce in a 
9-by-13-inch baking dish.
In a large bowl, lightly beat the egg. Stir in the turkey, onion, remaining 
1 teaspoon of kosher salt, additional pepper to taste, garlic powder, fennel 
seeds, rice, olive oil, and 1 tablespoon of the tomato sauce mixture.
Peel off   12 large cabbage leaves.111 Chicken, Meat & FishPlace about 3 tablespoons of fi  lling on each leaf. Fold the stem end over the

In Jewish tradition, ﬁ  sh symbolizes abundance and prosperity, so ﬁ  sh

YEARS STRONG
Rice seems so commonplace that we tend to overlook its importance in Jewish 
culinary history. But most Sephardi and Mizrahi meals would not be complete 
without rice. This venerable grain has been cultivated in China and India for 
at least 5,000 years and spread to Persia more than 2,000 years ago, where it 
became a star ingredient.
Beginning around the ninth century CE, Arab conquerors brought rice 
from Persia to Spain, Sicily, North Africa, and other parts of Asia, where it was 
embraced by Jews across regions. Since rice doesn’t grow well in most of 
Europe (excluding the southernmost regions, like Italy and Spain), it appears 
relatively infrequently in Ashkenazi cooking.
A�ter their expulsion from Spain and southern Italy, Jews brought rice dishes 
to northern Italy, where risottos became signatures of Venetian cuisine. It’s also 
hypothesized that Jewish saff  ron risotto, o�ten cooked for Shabbat, inspired the 
famous dish risotto alla Milanese.
Today, rice remains one of most cultivated grains in the world. Whether pre-
pared on its own (like in tahdig, where it develops a crispy bottom crust), stuff  ed 
in vegetables, served alongside a main dish (like a stew), or turned into a dessert, 
this ancient grain remains central.121 Noodles, Grains & BeansSweet Cheese Noodle Kugel

For many Ashkenazi Jews, noodle kugels, whether sweet or savory, 
represent pure comfort in a baking dish. Somewhere between a 
quiche and a casserole, these baked puddings are all-stars, gracing 
 Shabbat tables, holidays, and life-cycle events. My nicely sweet, richly 
 custardy rendition can be a side dish or dessert.
4 tablespoons butter, melted, plus more

The earliest versions of kugels, which originated among German Ashke-
nazi Jews, were likely savory puddings of starch, fat, and eggs steamed 
alongside overnight Sabbath stews. Their appeal and versatility 
endures to this day. Here, a crunchy top, thick noodles, and peppery kick 
distinguish this savory nondairy version.

Food historians believe Chinese wontons inspired these Jewish stuff  ed 
pasta dumplings, which are also cousins of Polish pierogi and Italian 
tortellini. Eastern European Jews made kreplach to repurpose left-
over meat as a ﬁ  lling (and cheese versions were enjoyed especially for 
Shavuot). They are best made with pasta dough, but wonton wrappers 
are faster and just as crowd-pleasing, especially when double-layered 
and fried (though they can also be served in hot soup). This recipe 
off  ers the option for either a meat or a cheese ﬁ  lling.
FOR A MEAT FILLING
1 /one.numr⁄/two.dnom to 2 cups /f_i  nely chopped Brisket with 
Red Wine and Tomatoes (page 104) or

TO MAKE THE FILLING
Prepare the meat fi  lling of your choice. Alternately, prepare the cheese fi  lling 
in a medium bowl by combining the ricotta, Parmesan, nutmeg, and salt and 
pepper to taste.

TO MAKE THE DUMPLINGS
Create double wrappers by moistening one wrapper with water and fi  rmly 
pressing another wrapper on top.
Place 2 teaspoons of fi  lling on a double wrapper,  just off  -center. Dip your 
fi  nger in water and moisten the outer border of the wrapper. Fold the wrap-
per over the fi  lling into a triangle, sealing the edges fi  rmly. Repeat with the 
remaining wrappers and fi  lling.
Transfer the kreplach to a sheet pan lined with wax paper and freeze 
for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Working in batches if 
needed, boil the kreplach, stirring frequently until al dente, 2 to 4 minutes.
Remove kreplach with a slotted spoon.
To fry, heat a layer of olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. 
Working in batches, add kreplach in a single layer, season with salt and 
pepper, and fry 4 to 6 minutes, until browned and crisp on both sides. Serve 
hot, garnished with crushed red pepper and fresh chives, if using.

Heat a layer of oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the 
onions, season with salt and pepper, and stir. Cover, reduce heat to low, and 
cook for 10 minutes.
Uncover, stir again, and cook 10 more minutes, or until softened and deep 
golden brown, stirring occasionally. Stir in the red pepper fl  akes, if using.
Meanwhile, in a small pan, bring the water to boil.
While the water heats, combine the kasha and egg in a medium saucepan over 
medium heat. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until the kernels are dry and toasted, stir-
ring constantly. Season with salt and pepper; then stir in the boiling water. Cover, 
reduce the heat to low, and simmer about 8 minutes, until the liquid is absorbed.
Add the kasha mixture to the pasta and stir to incorporate. Toss in the onions 
with a little more oil, if desired. Season to taste and serve warm.

A national dish of Syria and Lebanon, now popular in Israel, kibbeh is 
a deep-fried torpedo-shaped croquette made with ground meat and 
surrounded by a seasoned bulgur shell. Since shaping and frying the 
kibbeh takes time and skill, some cooks make an easier , but equally 
satisfying, baked pie version.
FOR THE CRUST
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus 
more for greasing
1 medium yellow onion, coarsely chopped
2 cups /f_i  ne- or medium-grain bulgur, 
 prepared according to package 
directions
/one.numr⁄/four.dnom cup all-purpose /f_l  our
2 teaspoons kosher salt

1 pound ground beef or turkey
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground allspice
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
/one.numr⁄/two.dnom cup pine nuts
Cayenne pepper (optional)
TO MAKE THE CRUST
Preheat the oven to 375°F . Grease a 9-inch pie dish with olive oil.
In a food processor, process the onion until nearly pureed. Add the bulgur, 
olive oil, fl  our, salt, allspice, and pepper. Process until a loose paste forms.127 Noodles, Grains & BeansTO MAKE THE FILLING
In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, warm a thin layer of olive 
oil. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, about 3 minutes or until 
softened. Add the beef, cinnamon, allspice, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook 
until browned, 3 to 6 minutes. Stir in the pine nuts.
TO MAKE THE PIE
Press about half the dough into the bottom and sides of the pie dish. Add 
the fi  lling. Press the remaining dough together on top of the fi  lling to cover 
completely. Cut the uncooked pie into wedges, and brush the top with oil and 
sprinkle with red pepper, if using.
Bake the pie until golden brown and slightly crisped, about 45 minutes. Cool 
15 minutes; serve warm or at room temperature.128 the essential Jewish CookbookIsraeli Couscous with

Israeli couscous, or ptitim, was created just after independence in 
the 1950s to meet the need for an inexpensive starch during a period 
of austerity. This tiny but versatile pearl-shaped, pasta-like staple 
remains popular , featured in everything from salads to stews. In this 
recipe, I’ve paired the slightly nutty couscous with a tomato-and- 
onion combination, typical of Middle Eastern cuisine.
1 (8-ounce) package Israeli couscous, 
cooked according to the package

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons red wine vinegar

In a large bowl, toss the still-warm couscous with the olive oil, vinegar, and 
salt and pepper to taste. Let cool slightly.
Stir in the tomatoes, onion, and basil leaves. Let stand at room temperature 
for 30 minutes to allow the fl  avors to meld.

When corn and cornmeal were introduced to Eastern Europe, 
 Romanians—including Romanian Jews—made use of it in porridge. 
Served soft or in slices, “mamaliga” (Romanian for “food of gold”) was 
enjoyed at breakfast, lunch, dinner , and as a side or a snack. Creamy 
and comforting, it’s served plain or with sour cream, jam, raw sliced 
onions, sautéed mushrooms, or with cheese on top or mixed in, as in 
this recipe.

Soak saff  ron in the boiling water for 10 minutes. Set aside.
In a large saucepan over medium heat, bring 1 quart of salted water to a boil. 
Add rice, cover, and cook for 6 to 8 minutes until al dente, stirring occasion-
ally. Drain well and set aside. (It will fi  nish cooking later.)
In a medium bowl, combine the dried apricots, currants, and barber-
ries. Set aside.
Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large heavy pan such as a Dutch oven (pref-
erably nonstick) over medium heat. Add the onion and season with salt and 
pepper to taste. Cook 3 to 5 minutes or until softened, stirring occasionally. 
Stir in the cinnamon and allspice. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and set 
aside. Wipe out the pan.131 Noodles, Grains & BeansReturn the pan to medium heat and add the remaining 4 tablespoons of oil. 
When hot, spread half the rice on the bottom and layer on the onions and the

salt and pepper. Cook uncovered for 10 to 14 minutes, until the rice down the 
sides and on the bottom just starts to brown. (It’s okay to quickly peek.)
Drizzle the saff  ron mixture over the top and cover tightly. Reduce 
heat to lowest setting and cook 30 minutes, then turn off   heat and let 
rest 10 minutes.
Spoon loose rice onto a platter, stirring to distribute the fruits. Using a 
spatula, carefully lift the remaining crusty rice out of the pan in large pieces.

V ariations of rice and lentils with onions have been comfort food 
for centuries across the Middle East. This relatively easy and ﬁ  lling 
vegetarian dish with caramelized onions was sometimes cooked and 
served on Thursday nights, before families began Shabbat prepa-
rations. Some recipes call for allspice or other warm spices—in this 
recipe, it’s your choice.
1 cup green lentils
3 cups water
Kosher salt
/one.numr⁄/four.dnom cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup basmati rice, well rinsed 
and drained3 large red onions, halved and 
thinly sliced
Freshly ground black pepper
/one.numr⁄/two.dnom teaspoon ground allspice, cumin, or 
cinnamon (optional)
In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the lentils with 3 cups of 
salted water. Bring to a boil, and then cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, warm the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high 
heat. Add the onions, season with salt and pepper to taste, and stir to com-
bine. Turn the heat to low, cover, and cook undisturbed for 15 minutes, until 
the onions are soft and starting to brown. Remove a third of the onions, 
coarsely chop them, and set aside.
Turn the heat to high, and continue caramelizing the remaining onions in the 
pan for 3 to 5 minutes or until dark and slightly crispy, stirring frequently. 
Remove them from the pan and set aside.
Once the lentils have cooked for 20 minutes, stir in the rice, chopped onions, 
and allspice, if using. Cover and simmer 12 to 15 minutes, until the grains are 
tender. Drain any excess water and season to taste. Transfer to a serving bowl 
and toss with reserved caramelized onions. Serve warm.133 Noodles, Grains & BeansSwiss Chard with Chickpeas

Black-eyed peas are a common New Year’s tradition in the American 
South, but they also have much older roots as a Rosh Hashanah food. 
Black-eyed peas are popular in Jewish communities in North Africa, 
Turkey, and the Balkans. As symbols of abundance and prosperity, 
these beans became featured in a Jewish new year’s dish called lubiya. 
Serve this spicy and satisfying Egyptian- and Turkish-inspired ver-
sion as an appetizer or main dish with rice or bread.

Matzah 152138 the essential Jewish CookbookBRAIDED BREAD
Challah: braided and golden, it’s the revered centerpiece of the Shabbat table. 
Although the general concept of breads for Shabbat goes back to ancient times, 
challah is a relatively new creation. For centuries, Sabbath breads were fl  at-
breads. “Challah” was a term referring to thickness, and later, a portion of dough 
broken off   as a symbolic off  ering.
It wasn’t until the fi  �teenth century that German and Austrian Jews, infl  u-
enced by their neighbors’ braided breads, began braiding loaves for Shabbat. 
Ashkenazi Jews brought braided challah to Eastern Europe and eventually to the 
United States. Only in twentieth-century America did braided, enriched bread 
become widely known as challah. And yet, it still didn’t have a lock on Shabbat.
An entirely separate strand of breadmaking existed among Sephardi and 
Mizrahi Jews, who developed other customs for their Shabbat breads (such as 
naan among India’s Jews or pita-like loaves among Yemenite Jews). They fl  a-
vored their fl  atbreads with spices, dried fruits, seeds, nuts, olive oil, and saff  ron.
Today, challah refers to almost any Shabbat or special-occasion bread, 
and it takes on symbolic shapes, like when braided round on Rosh Hashanah to 
represent the cyclical nature of life. Nonetheless, challah—braided or otherwise—
stands as a weekly connection to age-old Jewish tradition.139 BreadsExpress Bagels

From humble beginnings in Poland and the Baltics, the bagel became 
an everyday staple that Eastern European Jews later brought to New 
York. With a modern shortcut (borrowed from a viral recipe), you can 
make hot fresh bagels at home in no time. These express bagels are 
lighter-fl  avored and doughier than bakery bagels, but they’re still 
wonderful. Lightly press on your favorite toppings before baking.

Challah is a staple of Shabbat for Jews around the world, and it also 
might be the most delicious and beautiful bread you’ll ever pull out of 
your oven. Because challah doughs use eggs and sugar , they’re sweeter

porate. Gradually add ½    cup more, and then more in small increments until 
the dough forms a soft, sticky mass.
Knead the dough until smooth and elastic, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer the

Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1½    to 2 hours. Once 
risen, punch down the dough, cover, and let it rest 15 minutes.
Transfer the dough to a lightly fl  oured surface. Cut it into 3 pieces, roll those

The next time you enjoy chocolate cake, remember that back in the seventeenth 
century, Jewish bakers in Italy and France were among the fi  rst to add choco-
late and vanilla to cakes. Later, Hungarian Jews added chocolate fi  lling to cake 
rolls, and Polish bakers laced it through babka. In Austria, Jewish baker Franz 
Sacher used chocolate to invent the famed Sacher torte (chocolate cake and 
apricot jam).
But how did chocolate arrive in Europe, and why were Jews pioneers in 
using it? The story begins on the Iberian Peninsula. When explorers returned 
to Spain from the Americas, they brought back cacao beans and a cacao drink 
recipe that when mixed with sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon charmed the Spanish 
aristocracy. Jews fl  eeing Spain and Portugal a�ter 1492 carried knowledge of 
chocolate making (and its deliciousness) and their trading connections with 
them. They began importing cacao and making chocolate in places like Italy, 
Amsterdam, and Bayonne, France, where they established the country’s fi  rst 
chocolate factories.
When Jews came to the United States so did their chocolate-making. One 
Austrian Jewish immigrant launched what became Barton’s Candies, one of the 
fi  rst commercial enterprises to produce kosher-certifi  ed goods—even kosher 
chocolate Santas. The Jews weren’t the fi  rst to love chocolate, but they played a 
key role in its evolution into the product we know and widely love today.157 DessertsMandelbrot

Mandelbrot are twice-baked sliced cookies beloved in Ashkenazi 
baking. They’re similar to biscotti, but traditionally a bit more tender . 
Here, marzipan adds tenderness and a deeper almond fl  avor . This 
recipe even wins over people who don’t think they like biscotti.
1 (7-ounce) package marzipan, shredded 
using the large holes of a box grater
1 cup sugar
/one.numr⁄/two.dnom cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room 
 temperature, or vegetable oil
1 cup almond /f_l  our
4 large eggs, lightly beaten2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose /f_l  our
1 teaspoon baking powder
/one.numr⁄/two.dnom teaspoon baking soda
/one.numr⁄/four.dnom teaspoon kosher salt
/three.numr⁄/four.dnom cup slivered almonds
Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a large sheet pan with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, combine the marzipan and sugar to form a lumpy mixture. 
Work in the butter, and stir in the almond fl  our, eggs, and vanilla extract. Fold 
in the fl  our, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and almonds.
Form the dough into 2 loaves (about 2½    inches wide and 1 inch high) directly 
on the sheet pan. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until golden brown.
Slide the loaves still on the parchment onto a wire rack and cool for 
10 minutes. Adjust the oven temperature to 325°F and line the pan with new 
parchment paper.
Use a long serrated knife to cut the loaves diagonally into ½   - to 3/4   -inch-thick 
slices. Place slices fl  at on the sheet pan and bake 18 to 22 minutes or until 
toasted, fl  ipping over halfway through. Cool on wire racks.

An irresistible cross between a pastry and a cookie, rugelach have 
become one of the most popular Ashkenazic baked goods today, in 
many variations beyond the traditional cinnamon. Here a decadent 
dark chocolate ﬁ  lling takes center stage, deliciously. The cream cheese 
that makes the pastries fl  aky also makes the dough delicate. If it gets 
too sticky to roll, chill it for 5 to 10 minutes before proceeding.
FOR THE DOUGH
1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, room 
temperature
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room 
temperature
/one.numr⁄/four.dnom cup sugar
/one.numr⁄/eight.dnom teaspoon kosher salt
1 /one.numr⁄/two.dnom teaspoons vanilla extract
2 /one.numr⁄/two.dnom cups all-purpose /f_l  our, plus more

8 ounces bittersweet chocolate, melted 
and cooled slightly
5 tablespoons butter, room temperature
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
2 tablespoons unsweetened 
cocoa powder
/one.numr⁄/two.dnom teaspoon ground cinnamon
FOR THE TOPPING
Egg wash (1 egg lightly beaten with 
1 tablespoon milk and a pinch of salt)
Coarse sugar, for sprinkling (optional)
TO MAKE THE DOUGH
In a large bowl, cream the cheese and butter. Add the sugar, salt, and vanilla 
extract. Stir in the fl  our to make a sticky dough, adding more if needed.
Divide the dough into 4 balls. Between two sheets of wax paper, roll out each 
one to a 9- to 10-inch circle. Wrap and chill for 1 hour or overnight.159 DessertsWhen ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350°F . Line 2 large sheet pans with 
parchment paper.
TO MAKE THE FILLING
In a medium bowl, combine the chocolate, butter, brown sugar, cocoa, and 
cinnamon to form a paste.
TO MAKE THE RUGELACH
Remove the dough from the refrigerator to soften for a few minutes before 
handling. Immediately spread each round with a quarter of the fi  lling 
(a scant 1/3 cup), working quickly so the fi  lling doesn’t stiff  en.
Cut each round into 12 triangular wedges. Starting at the wide edge, roll up 
each triangle jelly-roll style. Place the rugelach seam-side down on the pans 
and freeze 10 minutes.
Brush each rugelach with the egg wash and sprinkle with sugar, if using. Bake 
until lightly golden, 18 to 22 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.160 the essential Jewish CookbookHamantaschen

These triangular ﬁ  lled pastries, eaten on Purim, get their name from 
the Purim story’s vanquished villain Haman. Hamantaschen (Yiddish 
for “Haman’s pockets”) hold several symbolic meanings, but more than 
anything today, they are a relished Ashkenazi treat. Traditional ﬁ  lling 
choices include apricot, poppy seed, and prune, but you can use any 
preserves or spreads you like.

TO MAKE THE DOUGH
In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Blend in the eggs, milk, and 
vanilla extract. Fold in the salt, baking powder, and fl  our, adding more fl  our if 
needed to form a soft dough.
Divide the dough into 2 balls. Between two sheets of wax paper, roll each ball

Macaroons started as confections of ground almonds, sugar , and 
egg whites, probably spreading around the world through Muslim 
territory, Spain, and later Italy, where they got their modern name. 
Naturally fl  our-free, these cookies became a Passover favorite. In 
the United States coconut versions gained popularity, though far too 
many people have only tried them from a can. They’re easy to make at 
home, and oh so good.

One of my family’s Rosh Hashanah dessert traditions has always 
been apple pie or apple crostata. Fall’s best apples melded with cin-
namon and other spices create wonderful aromas in the kitchen, and 
it wouldn’t be the holiday without them. For a fun twist, this recipe 
encloses that pie ﬁ  lling in egg roll wrappers to create individual pies 
quickly fried on your stovetop. They make a traditional yet quick and 
novel holiday or anytime treat.

among decadent yet gluten-free (and chametz-free) desserts. 
Although always a big hit at Passover , this cake’s dense, fudgy good-
ness elevates any occasion.
Cooking spray, for greasing the pan
Cocoa powder, for dusting the pan
12 ounces bittersweet chocolate, 
coarsely chopped
/one.numr⁄/two.dnom cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
1 tablespoon vanilla extract or /f_l  avoringPinch ground cinnamon
6 eggs, separated
/one.numr⁄/three.dnom cup sugar
Pinch kosher salt
Whipped cream, for serving
Adjust the rack to the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 
325°F . Coat a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray and dust it with 
cocoa powder.
In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the chocolate and butter. Remove it

cool slightly.
In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar and salt until slightly 
frothy and uniformly colored. Add to the chocolate mixture.
In a second large bowl, beat the egg whites on high speed until stiff   peaks form, 
1 to 2 minutes. In three additions, fold the egg whites into the chocolate mixture.
Transfer the batter to the springform pan and smooth the top. Place the 
pan on a sheet pan. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until brownie-like (and a 
cake tester comes out mostly clean). Cool 10 minutes on a wire rack, then 
unmold the cake.
Serve warm with whipped cream or chill overnight, letting rest at room tem-
perature for 30 minutes before serving.168 the essential Jewish CookbookCheesecake

When cream cheese was invented in New York in 1872, Jewish 
bakers used it on more than just bagels. It made fl  akier pastry dough 
and became a substitute (with sour cream) for cottage cheese pre-
viously used in cheesecake. Thus, New York–style cheesecake was 
born. Cheesecake wows crowds year-round, but is especially wel-
comed for dairy-centric holidays like Hanukkah and Shavuot. This 
super-creamy version pairs beautifully with fruit.
FOR THE CRUST
4 tablespoons (/one.numr⁄/two.dnom stick) melted 
butter, divided
1 /one.numr⁄/two.dnom cups crushed graham crackers (from 
about 10 full crackers)
1 tablespoon light brown sugar
/one.numr⁄/eight.dnom teaspoon ground cinnamon
/one.numr⁄/two.dnom teaspoon vanilla extractFOR THE FILLING
2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, 
room temperature
/two.numr⁄/three.dnom cup sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
3 eggs, room temperature
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
/one.numr⁄/four.dnom teaspoon kosher salt
3 cups sour cream
1 to 2 pounds strawberries, sliced or quar-
tered (optional)
TO MAKE THE CRUST
Adjust the rack to the lower third of the oven and preheat to 325°F . (Do not 
use convection bake setting.) Coat the sides and bottom of a 9-inch spring-
form pan with ½    tablespoon of the melted butter. Line the bottom with 
parchment paper cut to size and brush with ½    tablespoon of butter.
In a medium bowl, combine the graham crackers, brown sugar, cinnamon, 
vanilla, and remaining 3½    tablespoons of butter. Press evenly into bottom of 
the springform pan.169 DessertsTO MAKE THE FILLING
In a large bowl with an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese and sugar on low 
speed just until smooth. Beat in the cornstarch. Add the eggs one at a time, 
beating at low speed, until just incorporated. Fold in the vanilla extract, salt, 
and sour cream.
Pour the mixture into the crust and smooth the top. Tap the pan a few times 
on the counter to release any air bubbles. Place the pan on a sheet pan.
Bake 40 to 50 minutes, until the edges are set, but the center 3 inches still 
wiggle. (An instant-read thermometer should read 155°F when inserted in 
the center.)
Cool completely on a wire rack, then refrigerate, covered, at least 6 hours 
and up to 2 days. Remove the springform and serve chilled, garnished with 
strawberries (if using).

In Israel, sufganiyot (jelly-ﬁ  lled donuts) are a near-ubiquitous fried 
food for Hanukkah, making their way via Jews from Germany. Named 
for the word for “spongy dough,” sufganiyot have recently caught on in 
the United States. This recipe makes them bite-size and irresistible. 
1 /one.numr⁄/four.dnom teaspoons active dry yeast
/two.numr⁄/three.dnom cups lukewarm milk
1 egg
4 tablespoons (/one.numr⁄/two.dnom stick) unsalted butter, 
melted and cooled slightly
2 tablespoons sugar, plus more 
for coating/one.numr⁄/two.dnom teaspoon kosher salt
2 /one.numr⁄/four.dnom cups all-purpose /f_l  our, plus more 
as needed
Vegetable oil, for frying and oiling the bowl
Fruit jelly, about /three.numr⁄/four.dnom cup, for /f_i  lling
In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the milk (about 5 minutes).
Whisk in the egg, butter, sugar, and salt. Stir in the fl  our, adding more as 
needed to form a soft, sticky dough. Knead the dough gently until smooth, 
1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl, turn over, and cover. 
Refrigerate overnight.
The next day, defl  ate the dough and let rest, loosely covered, for 15 minutes at 
room temperature.
Roll pieces of dough into 1-inch balls. Place on a lightly fl  oured sheet of 
parchment paper. Cover and let rise until puff  y, about 45 minutes.
In a large heavy pan, heat 2 inches of oil to 360°F . Working in batches and 
reshaping as needed, fry the donuts until browned all over, 1 to 2 minutes. 
Transfer to a paper towel–lined plate.
Using a metal skewer, poke holes in the donuts and wiggle to create a cavity. 
Pipe or spoon in the jelly.
Roll the fi  lled donuts in sugar and serve immediately.171 DessertsMalabi

Malabi is a cool, creamy milk pudding popular throughout the Middle 
East. Diff  erent regions have their own traditional fl  avorings and 
toppings, but one of the most common is the lovely, fragrant pairing 
of rose water and nuts. Raspberry preserves add beautiful color and 
sweetness.
/one.numr⁄/three.dnom cup plus 1 tablespoon cornstarch
/one.numr⁄/three.dnom cup sugar
3 /one.numr⁄/two.dnom cups whole milk, divided
1 teaspoon vanilla extract1 cup raspberry preserves
/one.numr⁄/two.dnom cup water
1 teaspoon rose water (optional)
Chopped salted pistachios
In a large saucepan, combine the cornstarch and sugar. Stir in 3 to 
4 tablespoons of the milk to make a slurry.
Gradually stir in the remaining milk and vanilla extract. Cook 
over medium-low heat stirring constantly, until mixture thickens, 
about 10 minutes.
Divide the pudding into 6 serving dishes. Cover with plastic wrap directly on 
the pudding’s surface to prevent a skin from forming. Chill at least 4 hours.
To make the syrup: In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring 
the preserves and water to a gentle boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 
10 minutes. Cool slightly, stir in the rose water (if using), and chill.
To serve, top the pudding with syrup and nuts.173Chapter 10

I’m indebted to and grateful for the following people, who were instrumental in 
my creating this book:
The staff at Callisto Media, especially Elizabeth Castoria and Claire Y ee, and 
also freelance developmental editor Allie Kiekofer.
Rabbi Avis Miller, who has long inspired me, for her initial feedback and 
encouragement.
My recipe testers and tasters—dear friends and family—who adopted these 
recipes into their kitchens and made them their own. The recipes are so much 
better for the patience and talents of Nikki DiNenna, Lisa LaCamera, Sandra 
Thompson, Amy Glancy, Victoria Rapoport, Bob Wilson, Josie Mani, and Chef 
Richard DiNenna.
My longtime friend and editor partner, Lisa Resnick, for her editorial exper-
tise and always pointing my writing in the right direction.
My parents, Sandra and Berney, and my in-laws, Gloria and David, for their 
love and encouragement—lifelong gifts that keep on giving.
My husband Daryl, a true mensch, for his unwavering support, patient 
listening, brainstorming, emergency store runs, and being my everything, 
always—I love you.
