use of speci/f_ic products, and simple methods. Sure, there are dishes that require a laundry list of ingredients, hours in the kitchen, numer-ous steps and methods, and countless pots and pans. But this book isn’t about those dishes. We will save those recipes for another time, another place.
In this book, you will /f_ind mostly recipes for full meals—with 
the exception of a few side dishes and a few sweet endings in the last chapter. /T_hese dishes take just 30 minutes from start to /f_inish, includ-ing prepping and chopping ingredients and all the cooking. I’m being realistic and recognizing you have a life outside the kitchen—we all do. Cooking an authentic Italian meal should be part of your day, not your entire day.
I’ve included the Italian name for each dish, with the English 
translation, so when you’re ready to travel to Italy, you can order ver-sions of these dishes at Italian restaurants. Plus, when you post your beautiful dinner picture on social media, the Italian name will impress your friends even more! Many of the recipes include wine or antipasto pairing ideas to broaden your repertoire.
Are you ready to start cooking some delicious Italian dinners in 
30 minutes or less? If so, andiamo nella cucina . Let’s go to the kitchen!COLD ANTIPASTO PLATTER, PAGE 53 88888888888 13 88888888888 1

Fast and Easy 
Italian Cooking
Before we dive into the recipes, I would like 
to provide you with a bit of background on Italian culture, which very much revolves around food. A/f_t  er taking you on a virtual tour 
of Italy by describing its regional cuisines, I’ll discuss the importance of various staples that you should have on hand to make your life in the kitchen much easier. /T_h  en/uni00A0I’ll tell you about some kitchen utensils you’ll need to guarantee a great /f_i  nal product. Some of these items are very basic, and you likely already have them; others will make great additions to your kitchen.2

It’s no secret: Italians love to cook—and they love to eat just as much. Having been raised 
in Italy, I can attest that food is our most loyal companion. It’s there for us in times of celebration, but also in times of sadness and grief. What do you bring someone who has recently suﬀered a loss? In Italy, we bring food.
I am o/f_ten asked if I cook daily, and my answer is a resounding “yes!” And while 
most Italians cook at least one meal a day at home, many stay-at-home parents might cook three meals a day. Seasonality is also key in an Italian kitchen. Using seasonal ingredients is important for guaranteeing a more /f_lavorful result. Fresh tomatoes are best in the summer, and sturdier vegetables grow best in the colder months.
Many of the recipes you’ll /f_ind in this book are what Italians cook every day. But holi-
days are also centered around food. For example, Il Cenone  is perhaps the biggest meal of the 
year and is served on Christmas Eve. Many families from southern Italy base their Christ-mas Eve menu on seafood, but others, especially in northern Italy, opt for big pasta bakes, like lasagna or baked ziti, along with cutlets, various meats, and lots of vegetable side dishes.
REGIONAL CUISINE
Italy is made up of 20 regions, and although some dishes may be eaten throughout the entire peninsula, others are very regional. Although I was born in the south and lived in Calabria for many years, I now lead food and wine tours all over Italy, so I have been exposed to the very diﬀerent cuisines that make up Italian food. I have tried to represent many of the regions with the recipes in this book, while also introducing you to some dishes that are universally adored.
 /N.sc/o.sc/r.sc/t.sc/h.sc/w.sc/e.sc/s.sc/t.sc 
Valle d’ Aosta, Liguria, Lombardy, and Piedmont are the regions of northwest Italy. /T_he cuisine here is rich, buttery, and o/f_ten creamy. Lombardy and its capital, Milan, enjoy wonderful risottos like Risotto Milanese (page 53), as well as dishes like Veal Milanese (page 88). Liguria is the birthplace of classic basil pesto, which is used in Pesto Pasta Salad (page 30). Also being on the coast, Ligurians appreciate great seafood. In Pied-mont, mushrooms o/f_ten /f_ind their way into the cuisine, especially in the fall and winter months. 3

Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige, and Veneto. Emilia-Romagna’s capital,  Bologna, is widely recognized as the birthplace of Italian  cuisine, and the food here is decadent and sophisticated. All/uni00A0these regions enjoy egg pasta and stuﬀ  ed pastas such as/uni00A0 tortellini and ravioli. Tortellini in Broth (page 41) is based on a staple dish from the city of Bologna.

Central Italy is home to Tuscany, Lazio, Le Marche, and Umbria. Here a wide selection of legumes, pastas, and meats are enjoyed. Tuscans are known as bean eaters and enjoy a variety of dishes that use them, such as Pasta and Bean Soup (page 25). Despite its name, Roman Egg Drop Soup (page 22) does not come from Rome but is closely linked to the cuisines of Lazio and Le Marche, while Chicken Saltimbocca with Cherry Tomatoes (page 81) does have its origins in Rome.

Produce is widely used in many courses, like Green Beans and Potato Mash (page 63) and Leccese-Style Sweet Peppers (page 61), a dish with origins in Puglia. Olive oil is the fat of choice. And because of its close proximity to the ocean, a wide selection of seafood is also served, such as Neapolitan-Style Cod (page 101).
 /I.sc/s.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc/s.sc 
Away from the mainland we have Sicily and Sardinia, Italy’s islands. Lighter in /f_l  avor, the cuisine of the islands is, not surprisingly, centered around seafood, like Spaghetti in Clam Sauce (page 50). Lots of produce and locally made cheeses are also very much enjoyed in these two regions. Southerners also eat a lot of produce, such as eggplant and zucchini. Similar to other southern regions, the islands make use of olive oil and peperoncino.

Although this book is focused on 30-minute meals, a quick introduction to 
Italian cured meats and cheeses is in order, as these ingredients play such an important role in setting up an Italian table. They are mostly served as an antipasto, or foods that whet the appetite and get one started for the meal that is to follow.
/M.sc/e.sc/a.sc/t.sc/s.sc: Prosciutto, soppressata, mortadella, pancetta, capocollo, oh my! 
These are just a few of Italy’s most famous deli products. Thankfully, these items are readily available in the United States. You can /f_ind them in the deli section of most grocery stores. They should all be sliced very thin. 
/C.sc/h.sc/e.sc/e.sc/s.sc/e.sc/s.sc: Cheeses make a great addition to any antipasto platter, and 
you certainly have a large selection to pick from, even in the United States. It’s wonderful to select a few so/f.alt01t cheeses, as well as some hard ones. Mozzarella balls are delicious paired with prosciutto. A small bowl of fresh ricotta is great for dipping crostini or freshly cut veggies. Provolone is a standard in an antipasto plate; you can get it sliced, or cut the drier vari-ety into cubes. Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino Romano are both hard cheeses that pair wonderfully with the many types of meats found on an antipasto platter.
/C.sc/r.sc/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc /a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /c.sc/r.sc/o.sc/s.sc/t.sc/i.sc/n.sc/i.sc: You’ll enjoy all the meats and cheeses much 
more with a few high-quality crackers and crostini to go along with them. And while a hint of rosemary or other Italian seasoning is welcomed, avoid overly complicated /f_lavors in the crackers and crostini, so the /f_lavors of  the other main ingredients can really shine. A thinly sliced baguette  works wonderfully.5

Creating an antipasto platter these days seems to be a true art form. Many people get stuck on how beautiful it must look, but that is not the most important part. Instead, select a balance of /f_lavors and some contrasting textures. For example, so/f.alt01t cheese like ricotta will be wonderful on crunchy crackers. The saltiness of prosciutto is perfectly paired with the sweet, milky /f_lavor of mozzarella. And briny bell peppers and artichoke hearts will be oﬀset by the sweetness of dried /f_igs. Adding grapes to a platter also oﬀers some sweetness to oﬀset some of the saltiness of the meats. 
These items work very well together and make a great combination.

An Italian dinner in 30 minutes? Y es, it can be done, and the recipes in this book will 
prove just how easy and delicious it can be! I emphasize fresh, high-quality ingredients, but there are ways to minimize the work and steps involved and make it easier on yourself.
It’s about working smarter with the limited time we have. Perhaps that means mul-
titasking or selecting boneless cuts of meats as opposed to large bone-in meats. It means stocking your refrigerator and pantry with the right ingredients, and arming yourself with a well-equipped kitchen. I’m not talking about rare ingredients used for just a few dishes, but multipurpose items you can use again and again. And the same goes for equipment. /T_he items and ingredients I’ve listed here will serve you well, not just for the recipes in this book, but for many other dishes as well.
FRESH FLA VORS AND A FEW 
HIGH-QUALITY INGREDIENTS
Quality over quantity, that’s Italy’s culinary motto. Most everyday Italian recipes call for limited ingredients, maximizing each one’s /f_lavor pro/f_ile. But while quality is key, Italian cooking isn’t expensive. In the long run, you will end up using less of any given ingredi-ent because each will be /f_lavorful enough that you will not need much of it. I’ve provided you with an extensive list of high-quality ingredients that are easy to /f_ind at most large grocery stores in the United States; no need to go to a specialty Italian market for these items. I’ll even point out where  you can /f_ind them in the grocery store.
Many of these items are either widely imported from Italy, driving the cost down, or 
have US-made versions that are equally delicious. Y ou’ll note that I’ve maximized whole ingredients as much as possible, but there is no shame in using canned legumes, frozen vegetables, or canned tomatoes. Many Italians use these ingredients as well.

-/B.sc/a.sc/s.sc/i.sc/l.sc:  A summery herb, basil goes particularly well with any dish that contains 
tomatoes. /T_he large leaves bruise easily, and its peak freshness fades within a few days in the fridge. When summer rolls around and basil is abundant, I buy extra, and, along with parsley, wash, dry, and freeze it.7

the most delicate and tender. /T_hey’re great in sauces, as well as in classic dishes like 
Italian Sausages, Peppers, and Onions (page 85).
-/G.sc/a.sc/r.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc:  Garlic oﬀers an almost peppery tone to most recipes and is great in seafood 
dishes. Garlic should be stored in a cool, dry place. A recipe may call for whole garlic cloves that are removed later or /f_inely minced garlic that gets lost in the dish.
-/M.sc/u.sc/s.sc/h.sc/r.sc/o.sc/o.sc/m.sc/s.sc: How great are mushrooms in a 30-minute kitchen? My favorites are 
the ones with a gentler /f_lavor pro/f_ile, such as white button and cremini (aka baby bellas), which are the smaller cousins of portobello mushrooms.
-/O.sc/n.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc/s.sc:  Onions are another must-have in an Italian kitchen. Y ou’ll /f_ind many 
soups call for onions, as well as most risotto dishes. Store onions in a cool, dry place, and never in a sealed container, as they need to breathe.
-/P.sc/a.sc/r.sc/s.sc/l.sc/e.sc/y.sc:  Another staple in Italian cuisine, fresh Italian /f_lat-leaf parsley is used in 
countless dishes. /T_his herb is an economical ingredient that adds a fresh /f_lavor to any dish. It lasts just about a week in the fridge but can be frozen as well.
-/T.sc/o.sc/m.sc/a.sc/t.sc/o.sc/e.sc/s.sc:  Fresh tomatoes are best enjoyed raw, in salads or chopped up as a top-
ping in bruschetta. But don’t let an overripe tomato go to waste. Tomatoes past their prime are the perfect addition to soups and stews. While it’s tempting to refrigerate fresh tomatoes, they should be stored on your counter, stem-side down.
-/Z.sc/u.sc/c.sc/c.sc/h.sc/i.sc/n.sc/i.sc:  What I love about zucchini is how delicate they are, making them a 
great vegetable to use in a 30-minute kitchen. Zucchini cook very quickly, are great in soups, can make a tasty side dish, and are equally delicious simply sautéed with some garlic and olive oil. When buying zucchini, look for small ones, which have a more delicate /f_lavor and fewer seeds.
 /M.sc/e.sc/a.sc/t.sc/s.sc, /E.sc/g.sc/g.sc/s.sc, /a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /D.sc/a.sc/i.sc/r.sc/y.sc 
-/D.sc/e.sc/l.sc/i.sc /m.sc/e.sc/a.sc/t.sc/s.sc:  Italians eat a lot of deli meats—in sandwiches, in antipasto plates, 
and sometimes added to pasta dishes. Plan carefully: Once sliced, they will remain fresh for only a few days. Or choose the vacuum-sealed versions, which will keep for several months in the refrigerator when unopened.8

on Fridays. And while seafood was o/f_ten the dinner of choice, I also ate a lot of eggs 
for dinner. With a few added ingredients, eggs aren’t just a meal substitute, but a meal in themselves.

freezer. While boneless is my default most weeknights because it cooks faster, don’t shy away from items such as pork chops or lamb chops, both of which cook in well under 30 minutes. /T_hinly cut chicken breasts, boneless thighs, turkey breast slices, veal cutlets, and various chops are also ideal in a 30-minute kitchen.

you need it. To be sure of its authenticity, check the rind. /T_he real thing is branded with the name “Parmigiano-Reggiano” on it, so you should see part of the lettering on the rind. When you see a recipe in this book call for “grated Parmesan, ” you can be sure I am referring to the freshly grated version. If you are following a vegetarian diet, seek out a US-made Parmesan (see note under Pecorino Romano Cheese).
-/P.sc/e.sc/c.sc/o.sc/r.sc/i.sc/n.sc/o.sc /R.sc/o.sc/m.sc/a.sc/n.sc/o.sc /c.sc/h.sc/e.sc/e.sc/s.sc/e.sc:  Made from sheep’s milk, Pecorino Romano is 
sharper than its cow-milk counterpart, Parmigiano. A great choice to top pastas, soups, and even stews, Romano should also be purchased by the chunk and grated as needed. Wrap the chunk in plastic wrap, then add a layer of aluminum foil around it to keep it from drying out. Please note that neither Italian-made Parmigiano nor Romano is suitable for those following a vegetarian diet because of the animal rennet used in their preparation. /T_here are several US-made brands that do not use animal rennet, such as Stella, BelGioioso, Whole Foods brands, Trader Joe brands, and Boar’s Head, to name just a few. For recipes in the vegetarian chapter that sometimes call for grated cheese, we’ve opted to use ground nuts instead; feel free to substitute vegetarian cheese, if you wish. 
-/R.sc/i.sc/c.sc/o.sc/t.sc/t.sc/a.sc /c.sc/h.sc/e.sc/e.sc/s.sc/e.sc:  Ricotta is a wonderful fresh cheese made from the whey le/f_t 
behind when other cheeses are made. In Italy, you will /f_ind it made from sheep’s, cow’s, or goat’s milk, but in the United States it’s mostly made from cow’s milk. Being/uni00A0a so/f_t cheese, it’s wonderful as a spread on bread or added in a small bowl to an antipasto platter. It’s also a key ingredient in dishes such as Pasta alla Norma (page 72).
-/S.sc/a.sc/u.sc/s.sc/a.sc/g.sc/e.sc/s.sc:  Sausages oﬀer a lot of /f_lavor for the amount of time they take to cook. 
/T_hey are great added to sauces for a /f_irst course, and with vegetables they make a wonderful option for a second course. (In Italy, a second course usually consists of 9

ularity is precooked sausages. Al Fresco is my preferred brand. /T_hese are great in frittatas, in soups, or simply sautéed with some mushrooms and onions.
-/S.sc/e.sc/a.sc/f.sc/o.sc/o.sc/d.sc:  Seafood lends itself well to the 30-minute kitchen, as most seafood cooks 
in well under that time. Seafood is a great main course, or with added pasta it easily turns into a two-course meal. Look for fresh seafood whenever possible, but you can also /f_ind high-quality frozen seafood.

Fresh herbs freeze amazingly well, and I always have some staples, such 
as parsley and basil, in the freezer. Wash the herb /f_irst and pat dry with paper towel, then place it in a freezer bag and freeze for later use. Most vegetables also freeze very well. The key is making sure they are fully dry before they make their way into the freezer. As for meats, family-size packs are o/f.alt01ten cheaper to buy. When you bring them home, separate them into appropriate serving sizes for your family, pack in freezer bags, then freeze.

of Parmesan cheese. Added as a topping to many pasta dishes, they are now an 
integral component for preparing cutlets or anything au gratin. Breadcrumbs can be stored in the fridge or pantry; refrigeration will extend their freshness. I prefer freshly made breadcrumbs, which you can /f_ind in some bakeries, rather than the shelf-stable kind found in cardboard containers.10

But even if 
you’re not looking to add pasta to your daily menu, be sure to have a number of 
boxes on hand. Choose a variety of shapes and sizes to mix things up a bit. Pastina is dried pasta’s little cousin. Essentially, pastina  means “small pasta, ” and it comes in 
many shapes and dimensions of “small”—from teeny tiny acini di pepe to the larger though still very small farfalle. Pastina is perfect in soups and stews and can be cooked directly in the stock—no separate pot required.
-/I.sc/n.sc/s.sc/t.sc/a.sc/n.sc/t.sc /p.sc/o.sc/l.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc/a.sc:  Polenta makes a great gluten-free /f_irst course, especially in 
the fall and winter months when we’re all craving added warmth. Polenta is o/f_ten served with mushrooms (see Polenta with Sautéed Mushrooms, page 56) or sausages  (see Polenta with Sausage and Peppers, page 55). /T_he instant variety cooks in well under 30 minutes.
-/R.sc/i.sc/c.sc/e.sc:  Naturally gluten-free, rice is wonderful to have on hand for risottos and soups. 
Arborio rice is a starchy short-grain rice that’s ideal for risottos, as it will give you a creamier /f_inal product. Y ou can use less expensive long-grain rice for soups.
 /C.sc/a.sc/n.sc/n.sc/e.sc/d.sc /a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /J.sc/a.sc/r.sc/r.sc/e.sc/d.sc /I.sc/t.sc/e.sc/m.sc/s.sc 
-/A.sc/n.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/v.sc/i.sc/e.sc/s.sc:  A staple in southern Italian cuisine, anchovies add a kick to any dish, 
without much added cost. When cooked in a recipe, they o/f_ten melt into the sauce, leaving behind a savory /f_lavor without any distinguishable /f_ishy component. Use salt judiciously when adding anchovies, as they are o/f_ten very salty.
-/A.sc/r.sc/t.sc/i.sc/c.sc/h.sc/o.sc/k.sc/e.sc /h.sc/e.sc/a.sc/r.sc/t.sc/s.sc: Great in antipasti, pasta salads, or chicken dishes, a jar or 
two of artichoke hearts are always in my pantry. Some come packed in olive oil, and some are prepared with brine. I tend to use the oil-packed ones in various dishes and keep the oil they come packed in, but I rinse oﬀ the brined ones, as they can be a bit too vinegary.
-/B.sc/e.sc/a.sc/n.sc/s.sc /a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /c.sc/h.sc/i.sc/c.sc/k.sc/p.sc/e.sc/a.sc/s.sc:  Canned beans and chickpeas are the perfect staple to add 
to a 30-minute kitchen. /T_hey should always be drained and rinsed under cold water for a few minutes to remove any extra sodium. Great in soups and salads, and a staple in the classic dish Pasta and Bean Soup (page 25), canned beans and chickpeas require very little cooking time. My preferred brand is Progresso.11

sauces. My preferred brands include Pastene, Muir Glen, and San Marzano. Most 
come in 28-ounce cans, which makes the perfect amount of sauce for one pound of pasta. I tend to use crushed far more than whole or diced, as they are very versatile and save me the work of having to dice or puree them myself. Diced tomatoes are perfect for soups and stews and when you need a chunkier sauce. Muir Glen is a wonderful option, and so is the less expensive and easily found Hunt’s. Most come in 14.5-ounce cans, which is the perfect amount to add to a large pot of soup. Any le/f_tover canned tomatoes should be removed from the can, placed in a glass jar, and refrigerated for later use.
-/C.sc/a.sc/n.sc/n.sc/e.sc/d.sc /w.sc/h.sc/o.sc/l.sc/e.sc /p.sc/e.sc/e.sc/l.sc/e.sc/d.sc /t.sc/o.sc/m.sc/a.sc/t.sc/o.sc/e.sc/s.sc:  Wonderfully juicy and delicious, whole 
peeled tomatoes add a depth of /f_lavor to all soups, stews, and sauces. Some of my preferred brands include Pastene, Cento, Muir Glen, and DeLallo. More o/f_ten than not, you will want to break them down into smaller pieces, or puree them com-pletely. For a smoother sauce, add them to a blender and pulse for a few minutes.

in my pantry to add to salads, sauces, and pasta dishes. My preferred brands include Pastene and Genova, but StarKist also makes it and may be more readily available where you live.
-/O.sc/l.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc/s.sc:  Olives are a staple in southern Italian cuisine and are o/f_ten added to sauces 
and seafood dishes. Rinse olives before adding them to your dish, as the brine can be overpowering and can easily take over the entire dish.

will always /f_ind the frozen variety in the grocery store, and they cook so much faster than fresh ones. Birds Eye, River Valley, and Wegman’s brands are all good. Green Beans and Potato Mash (page 63) is one of my favorite dishes to prepare with frozen Italian green beans.12

carrots are wonderful in dishes like Vegetable Minestrone (page 24). /T_hey cook 
faster than their fresh counterparts and are already cut, convenient, and picked at their peak of freshness—not to mention extremely aﬀordable.
-/P.sc/e.sc/a.sc/s.sc:  Ideal in simple dishes like Penne with Ham and Peas in Cream Sauce (page 44) 
or added to vegetable soups or risottos, peas are the perfect item to pick up in the frozen food aisle. /T_hey cook fast and are /f_lavorful, and many kids also enjoy them.
-/S.sc/e.sc/a.sc/f.sc/o.sc/o.sc/d.sc: /T_he seafood section is the most expensive section in any grocery store. 
While I prefer fresh seafood whenever possible, it’s not always available. Frozen cod, tilapia, scallops, or shrimp can also be used in a pinch. Let them thaw out in the fridge overnight, or if you’re in a hurry, place them in the fridge in a bowl of cold water for 2 to 3 hours for faster thawing.
-/S.sc/t.sc/u.sc/f.sc/f.sc/e.sc/d.sc /p.sc/a.sc/s.sc/t.sc/a.sc:  Frozen ravioli and tortellini are /f_ine to use when paired with 
wonderful sauces in recipes such as Ravioli with Tomato-Basil Sauce (page 40) or Tortellini in Broth (page 41). /T_hese cook very fast—so fast, in fact, that I recom-mend watching them carefully, because they will easily overcook and break apart.

-/B.sc/l.sc/a.sc/c.sc/k.sc /p.sc/e.sc/p.sc/p.sc/e.sc/r.sc:  Ideal for seasoning many meats, black pepper is a staple in most 
cuisines. Buying an inexpensive grinder and grinding peppercorns as needed will give you optimal /f_lavor.
-/B.sc/o.sc/u.sc/i.sc/l.sc/l.sc/o.sc/n.sc /c.sc/u.sc/b.sc/e.sc/s.sc:  Another indispensable item in my kitchen is large, so/f_t bouil-
lon cubes. My preferred brand is Knorr. I use them a lot and will o/f_ten replace canned stock with them. /T_hey come in chicken, beef, seafood, and vegetable  /f_lavors. /T_hey are big, so when I need only a small amount of stock, I break one in half or into thirds.
-/I.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc /d.sc/r.sc/i.sc/e.sc/d.sc /h.sc/e.sc/r.sc/b.sc /b.sc/l.sc/e.sc/n.sc/d.sc:  A good blend of Italian dried herbs will contain 
oregano, basil, parsley, rosemary, thyme, and sage. Rub the herbs between your  /f_ingers before using to release their natural oils.
-/O.sc/r.sc/e.sc/g.sc/a.sc/n.sc/o.sc:  Oregano is perfect in all sorts of dishes, from chicken and pork to 
tomato sauces. It’s particularly appropriate to use in seafood dishes, and you will /f_ind that a number of dishes in the seafood chapter call for oregano. Simply Organic makes a wonderfully /f_lavorful dried oregano.13

Italy and the islands, red pepper /f_lakes should be used carefully and with a light 
hand. It’s far too easy to go from perfect heat to an inedible dish.
-/S.sc/e.sc/a.sc /s.sc/a.sc/l.sc/t.sc:  While you have many options, I /f_ind that a basic /f_ine sea salt does the 
job for most dishes. In the recipes, I’ve listed most salt to taste, as everyone’s salt tolerance is diﬀerent. But when cooking pasta, I recommend 1 tablespoon of sea salt for every 1 pound of pasta, and at least 4 quarts of water in a 6-quart pot.

 Balsamic Vinegar of Modena. /T_he traditional variety is made in only two speci/f_ic areas of northern Italy: Modena and Reggio Emilia. Trebbiano and Lambrusco grapes are used, the vinegar is aged in oak barrels, and the older it is, the thicker and sweeter it gets. Of course, the price will match its authenticity. It’s not practi-cal to cook with the traditional variety because of the cost. Other vinegars labeled “balsamic” are processed, thinner, and made in numerous places all over the world. While not the traditional kind, the cost makes them a viable option for cooking. Look for  balsamic vinegar without added coloring or caramel.
-/E.sc/x.sc/t.sc/r.sc/a.sc-/v.sc/i.sc/r.sc/g.sc/i.sc/n.sc /o.sc/l.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc /o.sc/i.sc/l.sc: EVOO is cold-pressed, meaning there is no heat used 
in making it. It’s made by grinding olives into an olive paste, then pressing that paste between stones to extract the juice. /T_he color is darker than regular olive oil, it’s pep-pery, and it leaves a ting of spiciness at the back of the throat. I reserve EVOO for use in raw preparations, in salads, or over grilled meats. Monini, Colavita, and California Olive Ranch Everyday Extra-Virgin Olive Oil are all easy-to-/f_ind,  reputable brands.
-/O.sc/l.sc/i.sc/v.sc/e.sc /o.sc/i.sc/l.sc:  Regular olive oil is a blend of EVOO and processed olive oil that has 
been heated. Any olive oil that doesn’t make the cut to be labeled EVOO is turned into the regular variety. I o/f_ten use regular olive oil in cooking. Filippo Berio, Whole Foods, and Wegman’s Organic oil are all trustworthy brands.
-/R.sc/e.sc/d.sc /w.sc/i.sc/n.sc/e.sc /v.sc/i.sc/n.sc/e.sc/g.sc/a.sc/r.sc:  /T_he most common dressing for salads in Italy, red wine 
vinegar is a staple in southern Italian cooking. It’s wonderful on any salad  containing 
iceberg, romaine, or even escarole. /T_hinly sliced cucumbers dressed simply with a generous amount of red wine vinegar, a drizzle of EVOO, sea salt, and dried oregano is a Calabrian “digestive” salad, eaten at the end of a heavy meal to aid with digestion.14

Think you have to spend hundreds on good Italian wine? Think again! 
Italians drink wine at just about every dinner, and you can rest assured they’re not spending hundreds per bottle. Table wine, as Italians call it, is the type of wine you drink daily: the type that goes great with everything, isn’t pretentious, and won’t make you feel guilty if you use it in cooking. Here is a short list of a few varieties that will go well with a range of dishes, both in the preparation of a recipe and to enjoy with dinner.
/W.sc/h.sc/i.sc/t.sc/e.sc/s.sc
/A.sc/s.sc/t.sc/i.sc /S.sc/p.sc/u.sc/m.sc/a.sc/n.sc/t.sc/e.sc:  A fruity sparkling white, Asti is a cheaper version of 
Champagne. Rather than cooking with it, reserve this one to enjoy with baked goods, biscotti, or a slice of Christmas panettone bread. Mix in some peach puree and you have a homemade Bellini (see page 107).
/S.sc/a.sc/u.sc/v.sc/i.sc/g.sc/n.sc/o.sc/n.sc /B.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/c.sc: With fruity /f_lavors of apples and peaches and 
high acidity, this is the wine to select if you want a more pronounced, full-/f_lavored white. It pairs great with chicken and seafood and is even good as an  aperitif with an antipasto platter.
/P.sc/i.sc/n.sc/o.sc/t.sc /G.sc/r.sc/i.sc/g.sc/i.sc/o.sc: This is my go-to wine for cooking and drinking. It’s dry 
and crisp, with hints of citrus. It’s a great everyday wine that deserves to be enjoyed o/f.alt01ten, especially on a hot summer day. This perfect  accompaniment to chicken, turkey, and seafood can be enjoyed with Chicken Piccata (page 80), Mixed Fish Fry (page 95), or great barbecue.
/S.sc/o.sc/a.sc/v.sc/e.sc: Less famous than the ever-popular Pinot Grigio, Soave is another 
wonderful option to pair with poultry and seafood. It has a bit more body than Pinot Grigio, with subtle fruity undertones. It’s also a good selec-tion to pair up with desserts, such as Warm Peaches with Chocolate and Crushed Amaretti (page 110).15

/B.sc/a.sc/r.sc/b.sc/e.sc/r.sc/a.sc: A lighter-bodied wine than Chianti, Barbera contains hints of 
berries and other fruits. It’s easy to drink and pairs well with red meats 
and mushroom dishes. Enjoy it with Beef Braciole (page 91) or Mushroom Risotto (page 52).
/C.sc/h.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc/t.sc/i.sc: Perhaps one of the most widely recognized Italian reds, Chianti 
is very dry and full-bodied. It pairs well with any dish containing tomatoes, so pull out the Chianti when preparing Ravioli with Tomato-Basil Sauce (page 40).
/S.sc/a.sc/n.sc/g.sc/i.sc/o.sc/v.sc/e.sc/s.sc/e.sc: A very acidic red, Sangiovese is Italy’s most widely used 
grape variety, and also a wine by the same name. It’s earthy, rustic, and, like Chianti, pairs well with tomatoes. Most pasta dishes will also be well  accompanied by Sangiovese, so enjoy it with Calabrian-Style Penne (page 45).
KITCHEN EQUIPMENT
A well-equipped and organized kitchen is key to maximizing your time and eﬃciency 
at mealtimes. /T_hese are the basics any home cook should have—in addition to standard measuring cups and spoons. With the exception of a very few items, these need not be expensive. And any investment you make up front will be worthwhile in the long run, as this equipment will last you a long time.
-/C.sc/o.sc/l.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc/e.sc/r.sc: /T_his is an iconic item in a country that eats pasta daily. A colander or 
two is an absolute must in any kitchen. Used to drain cooked vegetables and pasta, as well as rinse uncooked vegetables or fruits, colanders come in all shapes and sizes and are relatively inexpensive.
-/C.sc/u.sc/t.sc/t.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc /b.sc/o.sc/a.sc/r.sc/d.sc:  I use a number of diﬀerent cutting boards. Some are speci/f_ically 
for meats or seafood, others for fruits or vegetables. I use wood for produce, for slicing bread, and for hard cheeses and deli meats. /T_he wood ones shouldn’t go in the dishwasher, so for raw meat and seafood, I use a plastic one that can be sanitized in the heat of the dishwasher.16

they will last a long time. /T_he set should come in various sizes for various uses in 
the kitchen and at the table. Also consider purchasing a knife sharpener, or have the knives professionally sharpened as needed.
-/M.sc/i.sc/x.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc /b.sc/o.sc/w.sc/l.sc/s.sc:  /T_hese are some of my most-used kitchen items. I use them to 
wash produce and marinate any number of meats. I also place one underneath the colander when draining pasta or vegetables in case I need any of that water for the /f_inal dish. Stainless steel bowls will last a long time and are inexpensive.
-/P.sc/e.sc/e.sc/l.sc/e.sc/r.sc/s.sc:  A good peeler will save you time in the kitchen. Some are better than 
others, so it has taken me a few purchases to /f_ind my favorite one (/T_he Pioneer Woman from Walmart).
-/S.sc/a.sc/u.sc/t.sc/eacute.sc /p.sc/a.sc/n.sc/s.sc /a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /s.sc/k.sc/i.sc/l.sc/l.sc/e.sc/t.sc/s.sc:  Sauté pans have /f_lat bottoms and straight sides, 
making them the perfect tool when you will be cooking a large volume of  ingredients. Buy one that is big enough to hold a pound of pasta and its sauce (many pasta dishes /f_inish cooking directly in the sauce). Skillets are perfect for frying and browning, but they have /f_lared edges, so a 12-inch skillet will actually only have about 10 inches of cooking surface. Use them for recipes with fewer ingredients and no liquid.
-/S.sc/h.sc/e.sc/e.sc/t.sc /p.sc/a.sc/n.sc/s.sc: While only a few recipes in this book require a sheet pan, having a 
few in the kitchen will prove to be very useful, especially for baking. /T_hey come in diﬀerent sizes and materials and are inexpensive, and with some basic care and hand washing, they will last a long time.

seem to have a fascination with them! I don’t think you need nearly as many, but grab a set to keep on hand. /T_hey’re inexpensive and, well, I have yet to cook  anything that didn’t require the use of a wooden spoon.
-/S.sc/o.sc/u.sc/p.sc /p.sc/o.sc/t.sc /o.sc/r.sc /D.sc/u.sc/t.sc/c.sc/h.sc /o.sc/v.sc/e.sc/n.sc:  Extremely versatile items, soup pots and Dutch 
ovens have multiple uses, from the obvious soups to pasta, vegetables, and stews. A few of these in the kitchen are all you need. I particularly like Dutch ovens. /T_hey conduct heat well, can go from stove to fridge to oven, and are practically indestructible.17

Here are a few items that I think are nice to have but aren’t necessarily a must in your 
kitchen. /T_hese are just items that make your life easier, but other tools could also be used to get the job done.
-/F.sc/o.sc/o.sc/d.sc /p.sc/r.sc/o.sc/c.sc/e.sc/s.sc/s.sc/o.sc/r.sc:  For speed and eﬃciency in the kitchen, nothing replaces a 
trusted food processor. It chops vegetables, potatoes, nuts, and onions in record time. It’s also great for making pestos of all sorts.
-/G.sc/a.sc/r.sc/l.sc/i.sc/c.sc /p.sc/r.sc/e.sc/s.sc/s.sc:  If you’re not a fan of garlicky /f_ingers, this does an excellent job of 
mincing garlic extremely /f_ine.
-/M.sc/a.sc/n.sc/d.sc/o.sc/l.sc/i.sc/n.sc/e.sc:  I like a mandoline for /f_inely slicing zucchini, eggplant, and potatoes. 
A good knife will also do this, but this method is faster and every slice is identical. It’s probably one of the most dangerous tools in the kitchen! Always use the safety guard that comes with it.
//T.sc/h.sc/e.sc/r.sc/e.sc /A.sc/r.sc/e.sc /N.sc/o.sc /M.sc/i.sc/s.sc/t.sc/a.sc/k.sc/e.sc/s.sc /i.sc/n.sc /t.sc/h.sc/e.sc /K.sc/i.sc/t.sc/c.sc/h.sc/e.sc/n.sc ?
In teaching cooking classes, I am o/f.alt01ten asked, “Can I . . .?” What follows 
is usually a question about whether one can substitute an ingredient for another, or whether a diﬀerent wine can be paired, or if a cooking method can be altered. My answer is usually, “Of course you can!” No recipe is writ-ten in stone. There are no “mistakes” in the kitchen, just experiences that teach you how to better cook a dish the next time. You can improvise along the way. In fact, if you’re a novice in the kitchen, I highly encourage it. When you’re cooking in your kitchen a/f.alt01ter a hard day’s work, the goal is getting a delicious dinner on the table in minimal time, not achieving perfection.18

As the title of this book suggests, the recipes that follow will take you 30 minutes in 
total from start (prep) to /f_inish (cooking). /T_here’s work, commuting, child-raising, pets, errands, chores, doctors’ appointments, cleanup, and so much more in our daily lives. Add cooking to that, and I know you have a full plate—no pun intended! I am hoping you will /f_ind the recipes enticing, delicious, and inspiring enough to want to get in the kitchen.
A number of the recipes are my own take on classic and authentic Italian dishes you 
would see in homes and restaurants throughout Italy. I’ve altered a few ingredients or steps to either reduce the time to /f_it into our precious 30-minute window or to adapt to the fact that some ingredients may be harder to /f_ind in this country.
Y ou’ll note that there’s an emphasis on fresh ingredients. But to maximize those 
30 minutes, there will be times when we will use convenience items, such as frozen vegetables, canned beans, and canned tomatoes—because they’re the perfect weeknight ingredients.
Multitasking is also emphasized in the recipes. When the pasta is cooking, we will 
take advantage of that valuable time to prepare the sauces or other ingredients used in the dish. We will use your time well to help you make these dishes in that promised 30-minute window.

The word stracciatella  means “little shreds” or “things that have been torn. ” 
One might say that the eggs in this soup look like little shreds, hence its 
name. /T_his is a homey dish frequently prepared in Rome but recognized 
throughout the country. It’s the perfect soup for a cold winter night. It’s o/f_ten prepared with freshly made stock, but using store-bought stock cuts down sig-ni/f_icantly on time. It’s an old-fashioned dish that requires few  ingredients, which you likely already have on hand.

2Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, use a fork to whisk together the eggs, cheese, and pepper. 
3Pour the egg mixture into the boiling stock and stir constantly for 30 to 45 seconds with a whisk. Continue cooking for 5 to 6 minutes, whisking occasionally when the eggs come to the top. You will start to see what looks like shreds of eggs.

Tuscan Bread and Tomato Soup
 /P.sc/a.sc/p.sc/p.sc/a.sc /a.sc/l.sc /P.sc/o.sc/m.sc/o.sc/d.sc/o.sc/r.sc/o.sc 
Pappa al pomodoro  is a classic Tuscan dish that makes use of day-old bread. 
In Italy, it’s o/f_ten prepared with passata, which is unseasoned pureed 
tomatoes;  passata is not readily available here, so we’re using canned 
crushed tomatoes. /T_his soup is thicker than the tomato soup we’re used to here in the United States, thanks to the addition of the bread. For a thinner soup, adjust the amount of water, as noted in the recipe. Depending on the bread you use, you can choose to remove the crust for a /f_iner, less chunky soup.
/S.sc/e.sc/r.sc/v.sc/e.sc/s.sc 4
/P.sc/r.sc/e.sc/p.sc /t.sc/i.sc/m.sc/e.sc:  5 minutes
/C.sc/o.sc/o.sc/k.sc /t.sc/i.sc/m.sc/e.sc:  25 minutes
3 tablespoons olive oil, 
plus more for drizzling
½ small yellow or white 
onion, ﬁnely chopped
2 to 3 garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons chopped 
fresh parsley
2 tablespoons chopped fresh 
basil, plus more for garnish
Sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 (28-ounce) can 
crushed tomatoes
2 cups water, plus 
more as needed
6 cups cubed day-old 
bread, crouton size1In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat for 
1 to 2 minutes. Add the onion, garlic, parsley, basil, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 2 minutes, or until the onion is slightly softened and the garlic is golden but not burned.
2Carefully add the tomatoes—they will splatter as they hit the hot oil. Add the water and simmer over low heat for 6 to 7 minutes, until the soup has thickened slightly.
3Add the bread cubes and stir, mixing and breaking the bread with a wooden spoon as it softens in the soup. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally as needed to break down the bread further. For a thinner soup, add 1 to 2 cups more water.
4Taste and add more salt and pepper as needed. Serve hot with a drizzle of olive oil and some fresh basil on top.
/P.sc/a.sc/i.sc/r.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc /t.sc/i.sc/p.sc: Since tomatoes are the main ingredient in 
this soup, it will pair perfectly with a glass of Sangiovese 
wine, which has enough acid to complement the acid in  the tomatoes.24 - /three.taboldstyle/zero.taboldstyle-/m.sc/i.sc/n.sc/u.sc/t.sc/e.sc /i.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc /c.sc/o.sc/o.sc/k.sc/b.sc/o.sc/o.sc/k.sc _

There is nothing as comforting as a big bowl of vegetable minestrone on a 
cold winter day. It may have started in Italy, but this soup is now widely enjoyed here in the United States as well and is a popular choice on 
many Italian restaurant menus. While some versions of minestrone have a long  cooking time, a combination of quick-cooking vegetables like the ones used here will have you enjoying a bowl of this hearty soup in no time. /T_here’s no exact recipe for this classic, so the vegetables used are all according to your preference.

Freshly ground black pepper
1 (12-ounce) bag 
fresh spinach1In a large soup pot, combine the oil, onion, carrot, and 
parsley and cook over medium heat for 1 minute, or until the onion is slightly softened. Add the tomatoes, stir, and cook for 1 more minute.
2Add the stock, water, frozen vegetables, zucchini, cannellini beans, and salt and pepper to taste. Increase the heat to high, cover, and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. If you want a brothier soup, add an additional cup of water.
3Add the spinach and, using a wooden spoon, pack the leaves down into the hot soup. Continue cooking for about 2 minutes, or until the spinach is wilted. Serve hot.
/V.sc/a.sc/r.sc/i.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc: To make this dish even more ﬁlling, add some

While this is a classic Italian dish, there are as many ways to prepare 
it as there are nonnas in Italy! Some serve it dry, some serve it very soupy, and some add lots of tomatoes, while others serve it in bianco, 
 meaning without tomatoes. /T_his version is one of the many ways I make it 
myself,  depending on my mood and what’s in the cupboard, but it’s not written in stone. See the tip for variations.

cheese (optional)1In a large soup pot, combine the oil, carrots, onion, 
garlic, and parsley. Sauté over medium heat for about 2 minutes, or until the onion is slightly softened and the garlic is golden but not burned.
2Add the crushed tomatoes and continue cooking for 2 minutes, or until it’s simmering. Add the beans, salt to taste, and enough water so it comes  several inches above all the ingredients. Bring to a full boil over high heat and cook for 6 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3Add the pasta, stir, and cook according to the package directions (usually about 11 minutes),  stirring occasionally.
4Spoon into bowls. If desired, garnish with Parmigiano.
/V.sc/a.sc/r.sc/i.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc: You can make this soup in bianco  by skipping 
the tomatoes or by adding just 1 diced fresh tomato instead. 
You can also add chopped sausage or pancetta when you sauté the onion. Or, for a stew-like dish, rather than soup, cook the pasta separately and add it at the end. To do this, reduce the amount of water that gets added with the beans to just enough to cover the ingredients. Then cook the pasta separately in a pot of boiling water, drain, and stir into the soup after it’s fully cooked. 26 - /three.taboldstyle/zero.taboldstyle-/m.sc/i.sc/n.sc/u.sc/t.sc/e.sc /i.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc /c.sc/o.sc/o.sc/k.sc/b.sc/o.sc/o.sc/k.sc _

3In a separate medium bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the egg whites for about 2 minutes, or until stiﬀ peaks form. Using a rubber spatula, fold the whites into the egg yolks, using a gentle hand so as not to deﬂate the beaten whites.
4Spread the mixture onto the baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes.
5Meanwhile, in a large soup pot, bring the stock to a boil over high heat and boil for 3 to 4 minutes, until the stock is very hot.

1Pesto Pasta Salad
 /I.sc/n.sc/s.sc/a.sc/l.sc/a.sc/t.sc/a.sc /d.sc/i.sc /P.sc/a.sc/s.sc/t.sc/a.sc /c.sc/o.sc/n.sc /P.sc/e.sc/s.sc/t.sc/o.sc 
Adored by all of Italy, young and old alike, basil pesto is a specialty of 
the region of Liguria. Basil, pine nuts, and freshly grated cheese are key ingredients in this simple but iconic summery dish. While most o/f_ten 
served with pasta, this no-cook sauce can also be used as a spread on panini or even to top some grilled meats. In Italy, the pesto is o/f_ten prepared with a mortar and pestle, but using a food processor speeds things up and results in a smoother sauce.

Sea salt
12 ounces fusilli pasta
4 to 5 cups fresh basil leaves
2 garlic cloves, peeled
3 tablespoons pine nuts
4 tablespoons extra-virgin 
olive oil, divided
¼ cup grated 
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
4 precooked sweet 
Italian sausages, each 
cut into 8 to 10 slices
1 pint cherry 
tomatoes, halved1In a 6-quart pot, bring 4 quarts of salted water to a 
boil over high heat. Add the fusilli and cook according to the package directions.
2Meanwhile, in a food processor, combine the basil, garlic, pine nuts, and 3 tablespoons of olive oil and pulse for 1 minute, stopping to press down the basil leaves. Add the Parmigiano and pulse until a creamy paste is formed, about 1 minute. Set aside.
3In a medium skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Add sausage slices and heat for 1 minute.
4Drain the pasta and add it to a large serving platter. Add the pesto, sausages, and tomatoes and mix until everything is combined. Serve immediately or at  room temperature.
/V.sc/a.sc/r.sc/i.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc: While basil is typically the key ingredient in a 
classic pesto, spinach or arugula can also be used to change 
things up a bit. And if you can’t ﬁnd pine nuts, almonds and walnuts make great substitutes.31 - /H.sc/e.sc/a.sc/r.sc/t.sc/y.sc /S.sc/o.sc/u.sc/p.sc/s.sc /a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /S.sc/a.sc/l.sc/a.sc/d.sc/s.sc _

Caprese-Style Tortellini Salad

Caprese salad is a classic summery salad from the island of Capri, oﬀ the 
Amal/f_i Coast. It is believed that a war veteran wanted to create a dish that represented the colors of the Italian /f_lag, so he selected a handful of ingre-
dients that contained red, white, and green. I’ve added tortellini to the classic recipe, which turns this light salad into a full meal.

mozzarella cheese, cubed
1 cup fresh basil leaves
3 tablespoons 
extra-virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon dried oregano1Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high 
heat. Add the tortellini and cook according to the package directions. Pay close attention to the timing, as they can easily overcook.
2Meanwhile, place the tomatoes on a large serving platter, season with salt, and mix. Add the mozzarella, basil, oil, and oregano and toss to combine.
3Drain the tortellini and add them to the platter. Mix gently to avoid breaking the tortellini. Serve hot or at room temperature.
/P.sc/a.sc/i.sc/r.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc /t.sc/i.sc/p.sc: A dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio, will 
pair nicely with both the mozzarella and tomatoes in this dish,

Ideal for picnics, days at the beach, and even lunch boxes, an Italian rice salad 
is a staple dish served all over Italy, with many variations. Y ou can serve it immediately, while it’s still warm, which is my favorite way, or you can let 
it come to room temperature or even chill it. Rice soaks up a lot of oil, which makes this dish that much more delicious.

1½ cups Arborio rice
¼ cup extra-virgin olive

2 (5-ounce) cans Italian tuna

4 large hard-boiled eggs,

¾ cup ﬁnely cubed 
deli-style ham
¼ pound deli-style salami

½ cup shredded 
mozzarella cheese
½ cup grated 
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese1Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high 
heat. Add the rice and cook until tender, 18 to 20 minutes. Drain well.
2Meanwhile, chop and prepare the rest of the ingredients.
3In a large serving bowl, combine the drained rice and olive oil. Flake in the tuna, add the oil from the tuna cans, and mix well to coat the rice with the oils.
4Add the eggs, ham, salami, mozzarella, and Parmigiano and mix well. Add more oil, if desired, as the rice tends to soak it up. Season with salt and serve hot or at room temperature.
/V.sc/a.sc/r.sc/i.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc: Although this recipe is very ﬁlling, you can 
add olives, canned corn, or pickled vegetables. You can 
use long-grain rice, as well; the ﬁnal result will be just a bit less creamy.CHEESY POLENTA WITH SAUTÉED GREENS, PAGE 573 88888888888 13 88888888888 1

Can a sauce really be so simple, economical, quick, and delicious as this 
one? It sure can! Ravioli tossed with butter and sage sauce is a classic combination that cooks in record time and is ideal for weeknight dinners, 
but it’s also sophisticated enough for weekends or even for that dinner party you’ve been meaning to put together. In Italy many serve this dish with home-made ravioli, but using fresh or frozen ravioli from your grocery store will save substantial prep time. I /f_ind that the fresh ones, which you can /f_ind in the refrig-erated aisle (or sometimes in the dairy section), are best. Choose a /f_illing that is not too  overpowering, such as ricotta cheese or pumpkin.

2Meanwhile, in a large sauté pan, melt the butter over low heat and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until the butter is slightly browned but not burned. It will get foamy. Add the garlic and sage and mix well. Season with salt and pepper.
3Drain the ravioli and add them to the pan. Mix gently to combine and cook them in the sauce for 1 minute.

2Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes until it’s almost translucent.

Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let the sauce simmer for 15 minutes to thicken.
3Add the ravioli to the boiling water, stir, and cook according to the package directions. Do not overcook or they will burst open. Drain the ravioli and return them to the pot they cooked in. Add about 1 cup of the cooked tomato sauce and gently mix.
4Divide the ravioli among serving plates. Top each dish with about ¼ cup of additional sauce and garnish with a basil leaf. If desired, sprinkle with grated cheese. Serve hot.

Tortellini in brodo  is a classic dish served in northern Italy, especially in 
the city of Bologna in the Emilia-Romagna region, which is where this 
dish is believed to have originated. Tortellini are o/f_ten served in a simple 
broth and topped with freshly grated Parmesan cheese—another specialty of this region. Both the stock and the tortellini are o/f_ten made from scratch in Bologna, which turns this into a very labor-intensive meal. /T_his streamlined version cuts that time to 30 minutes.

2Increase the heat to high, add the water and bouillon cube, season with salt and pepper, and bring to a full boil. Boil for 10 minutes.
3Add the tortellini and cook according to the package directions. Take care not to overcook or they will burst open. During the last 2 minutes of cooking time, add the spinach and stir to wilt. Remove from the heat and serve immediately. If desired, top with Parmigiano.
/I.sc/n.sc/g.sc/r.sc/e.sc/d.sc/i.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc /t.sc/i.sc/p.sc: Refrigerated tortellini and ravioli are a

pay close attention to the cooking time.

Penne, panna e prosciutto is a classic dish served throughout Italy. It’s 
especially prepared by busy parents who struggle to get their children to eat some vegetables. /T_he combination of cream and Parmesan results in a 
super creamy and velvety sauce, while the ham oﬀers a bit of saltiness. In Italy, it is o/f_ten prepared with fresh peas, especially in springtime, but using frozen ones makes this the perfect dish any time of year.

Sea salt
1 pound penne pasta
3 tablespoons olive oil

1 (12-ounce) bag frozen peas
¼ cup water
½ pound deli-style ham, 
cubed or cut into strips
¾ cup heavy cream
¼ cup grated 
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
Freshly ground black pepper1In a 6-quart pot, bring 4 quarts of salted water to a 
boil over high heat. Add the penne and cook for  1 to 2 minutes less than the package directions.
2Meanwhile, in a large sauté pan, heat the oil and onion over medium heat and cook for about 2 minutes, or until the onion is slightly softened and translucent.
3Add the peas and water and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until the peas are slightly softened. Add the ham and cook for an additional 3 minutes, stirring  occasionally. Add the cream and bring everything to a low simmer. Reduce the heat and cook the sauce and peas together for an additional 5 minutes to thicken the cream slightly.
4Reserving about ½ cup of the pasta water, drain the pasta and add to the pan with the peas. Add the reserved pasta water, toss to combine, and cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes, until the pasta is fully cooked.
5Remove the pan from the heat and add the Parmigiano, mixing well to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot./V.sc/a.sc/r.sc/i.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc: The word

The food of Calabria is spicy, pungent, and minimalist. One of the most 
widely used ingredients in Calabria is chile peppers: fresh, dried, as a paste, or as pepper /f_lakes. Along with other pungent ingredients—such as 
anchovies, capers, and olives—Calabrian chiles always seem to /f_ind a way into pasta dishes and sauces. /T_his recipe is de/f_initely spicy, so feel free to adjust the amount of heat according to your preference.

This dish from Rome brings together a classic red sauce and a simple white

This vegetable ragù is a delicious pasta sauce that’s simple, healthy, and 
hearty. It’s a wonderful option for the vegetarians in your life (and vegans, if you leave out the cheese), but also very much enjoyed by those who eat 
meat. Because this is a thick sauce, I prefer using a sturdy tubular pasta, such as rigatoni, which stands up well to the thick sauce. (Photograph on page vi.)

Spaghetti Puttanesca
A classic dish from Naples and the surrounding area, this sauce is quick, 
spicy, and full of /f_lavor. Local olives are o/f_ten used in Naples, but easier-to-/f_ind Kalamata olives are a great substitute. Add salt sparingly in 
this dish, because the capers, olives, and anchovies are all fairly salty ingredients. Spaghetti is recommended, but you could use any long, thin pasta of your choice.

Add the capers and olives and stir to combine. Add the anchovies and break them up with a wooden spoon. They will dissolve almost completely.
3Add the crushed tomatoes and oregano. Season lightly with salt. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 10 minutes to slightly thicken the sauce.
4Reserving ¼ cup of the pasta water, drain the pasta. Add the pasta and a few tablespoons of the reserved pasta water to the sauce and mix to combine. Cook for an additional 2 minutes, mixing well to make sure the pasta is well coated with the sauce.

This iconic dish, a classic seafood pasta of southern Italy, is usually served 
with a long, delicate pasta such as spaghetti or linguine. One variation is to add capers and olives, but I’ve le/f_t those out in this recipe to let the main 
ingredient, the clams, shine through. Red pepper /f_lakes are a staple in southern Italy, but feel free to leave them out if you prefer a milder sauce that is just a bit more subtle.

1 tablespoon chopped 
fresh parsley
Freshly ground black pepper1In a 6-quart pot, bring 4 quarts of salted water to a 
boil over high heat. Add the spaghetti, stir, and cook to just under al dente, about 2 minutes less than the package directions.
2Meanwhile, to prepare the clam sauce, close any of the open clams by giving them a quick tap, and discard any that don’t close. In a large sauté pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and pepper ﬂakes and stir for 1 minute. Add the clams and wine, cover, and cook for 6 to 7 minutes, until the clams have opened. Discard any clams that remain unopened after 7 minutes of cooking.
3Drain the spaghetti and add to the pan with the clams. Add the parsley and mix to combine. Season with salt and pepper.
/V.sc/a.sc/r.sc/i.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc: Want to mix things up a bit and serve this 
dish rosso? Rosso means “red” in Italian and it refers to 
simply adding some canned tomatoes to any dish. Add one 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes to the pan before adding the clams and cook the tomatoes for about 5 minutes. Then add the clams and continue with the recipe as written. You will end up with a lovely red sauce that’s a bit sturdier and heartier—and thus perfect for tubular pasta.51 - /P.sc/a.sc/s.sc/t.sc/a.sc, /R.sc/i.sc/s.sc/o.sc/t.sc/t.sc/o.sc, /a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /P.sc/o.sc/l.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc/a.sc _

A basic tomato sauce beefed up with ground meat is a dish served throughout 
Italy. While a typical meat sauce can take two or more hours to cook, using 
ground meat saves a lot of time. I suggest using lean beef, but you could use 
ground turkey or veal without adjusting the cooking time. Fresh fettuccine is great in this dish, but you could also use dried pasta.

Add the ground beef and use a wooden spoon to break the meat into bite-size chunks. Season with salt and pepper and brown the meat for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring often to prevent burning and sticking.
2Stir in the crushed tomatoes and water, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened. 
3Meanwhile, in a 6-quart pot, bring 4 quarts of salted water to a boil over high heat. 
4During the last 2 minutes of the sauce’s cooking time, add the fettuccine to the boiling water and cook according to the package directions (usually only 2 to 3 minutes).

1 tablespoon unsalted butter
½ cup grated

2Meanwhile, in a large sauté pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cook the onion for about 1 minute, until slightly softened. Add the rice and cook in the oil and onion, stirring for 1 minute, or until the rice turns slightly paler. Stir in the wine. Let the rice absorb the wine, which will take about 1 minute.
3When the rice has absorbed the wine, add 2 ladles of the warm stock to the rice. Stir to combine and continue stirring until the liquid is absorbed. When the liquid is absorbed, add 2 more ladles of stock and stir again to combine. Continue the process of adding 2 ladles at a time of stock for about 17 minutes, at which point the rice will still be a few minutes underdone.
4Add the mushrooms, stir well, and cook the mushrooms and rice together, stirring, for about 3 minutes.

½ cup grated 
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese1In a large soup pot, bring the stock to a boil over high 
heat. Add the saﬀron strands, then reduce the heat  to low, just to keep the stock warm as you prepare  the risotto.
2Meanwhile, in a large sauté pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cook the onion for about 1 minute, or until slightly softened. Stir in the rice and cook, stirring, for 1 minute, or until the rice turns slightly paler. Stir in the wine. Let the rice absorb the wine, which will take about 1 minute.
3When the rice has absorbed the wine, add 2 ladles of the warm stock to the rice. Stir to combine and continue stirring until the liquid is absorbed. When the liquid is absorbed, add 2 more ladles of stock and stir again to combine. Continue the process of adding 2 ladles at a time of stock, until the rice is almost cooked but still al dente, which will take about 20 minutes.
4Remove from the heat, stir in the butter and Parmigiano, and serve immediately.

Peas with pancetta is a classic combination for a side dish adored throughout 
all of Italy. Everyone seems to have their own preference when it comes to doneness for the peas. Some folks cook them for just a few minutes, while 
others cook them as long as 20 minutes. Depending on your preference, you can add them at the beginning of the cooking process, in the middle (as suggested in the recipe), or during the last 3 to 4 minutes of the risotto cooking time.

A naturally gluten-free specialty from northern Italy, polenta is the 
 perfect dinner when you want a change from pasta or rice. A fre-quent  accompaniment to polenta are sausages and peppers. /T_he use 
of instant polenta and precooked sausages cuts cooking time substantially. I’ve given a range for the stock to use here because the exact amount will depend on your preferred style of enjoying polenta: /T_he smaller amount of stock pro-duces a thicker, stiﬀer polenta; the larger amount will result in a much creamier, smoother polenta.

1½ cups instant polenta
1 tablespoon unsalted butter1In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high 
heat. Add the bell peppers, onion, parsley, and salt and black pepper to taste and stir to combine. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until the onions and peppers are slightly charred. 
2Stir in the sausage, crushed tomatoes, and water. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure nothing sticks to the pan. Add an additional tablespoon of oil or a few tablespoons of the stock if the mixture seems dry. The peppers will soften as they cook. 
3Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, bring the stock to a boil over high heat. Gradually add the polenta to the boiling stock and cook according to the package directions (usually 3 to 4 minutes), stirring constantly to prevent sticking.

 Zucchini is a beloved summer vegetable that’s served in countless ways, from antipasto, to main courses, to the obvious side dishes, to meats or

A dish served frequently in southern Italy, especially Calabria, this humble

salt. Add the potatoes and green beans, bring to a boil over high heat, and cook for about 7 minutes, or until the green beans are fully cooked and the potatoes are fork-tender.
2Drain the beans and potatoes and return them to the pot. With a wooden spoon or a potato masher, mash everything a number of times until the potatoes are broken down and resemble chunky mashed potatoes. The green beans should also be mashed slightly.
3Add the basil, garlic, oil, and pepper ﬂakes (if using) and mix everything to combine. Season with additional salt.

3To the bowl with the minced stems, add the breadcrumbs, walnuts, oil, parsley, and garlic. Mix/uni00A0everything until the stuﬃng is moistened and  well combined.
4Arrange the mushroom caps on a baking sheet and season with salt and pepper. Using a tablespoon, generously stuﬀ the caps with the ﬁlling, using the palm of your hand to pack it in. Lightly drizzle some additional oil on top. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, until the tops are lightly browned.

Oven-Roasted Stuffed Tomatoes

It seems every part of Italy has its own version of stuﬀed tomatoes. While 
Sicily stuﬀs tomatoes with lots of breadcrumbs, cheese, raisins, pine nuts, and anchovies, other areas use sausage meat, while still others use rice, which is 
an ever-popular choice in Rome. In this version, we’re using the insides of the tomatoes themselves, along with a few other add-ins. /T_his speeds up the process considerably, while still resulting in a tasty, crunchy, and very satisfying meal.

/C.sc/o.sc/o.sc/k.sc /t.sc/i.sc/m.sc/e.sc:  20 minutes
3 tablespoons olive oil, plus 
more for the baking dish
6 large tomatoes
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon chopped 
fresh parsley
½ cup pine nuts, 
ﬁnely ground 
1 cup ﬁne breadcrumbs 
(preferably from a bakery)
Sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper1Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease a 
9-by-11-inch glass baking dish with olive oil.
2Cut the stem ends oﬀ the tomatoes, use a teaspoon to remove the insides, and transfer to a cutting board. Take care not to break the walls of the tomatoes as you work. Set the tomatoes upside down to drain on some paper towels while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
3Mince the insides of the tomatoes and put them in a medium bowl. Add the 3 tablespoons of oil, the garlic, parsley, pine nuts, and breadcrumbs and mix well to combine. Season with salt and pepper.
4Spoon the mixture into the hollow tomatoes. Carefully set them in the baking dish and bake for 15 to 16 minutes, until the topping is crunchy. 
5Turn the oven to broil for an additional 2 to 3 minutes to toast the tops. Serve hot or at room temperature.
/V.sc/a.sc/r.sc/i.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc: To make this dish even more ﬁlling, reduce

A specialty of southern Italy, uova in purgatorio  is a go-to lunch or dinner 
when you want to keep cooking to an absolute minimum, but you still 
want something homemade, healthy, and delicious. Southerners add 
lots of red pepper /f_lakes, but I must confess, I rarely do; I prefer a more subtle dish. It’s uncertain where the name came from. Some claim that the egg white  represents the purity of heaven, while the /f_iery red sauce represents the other side. /T_hus, the eggs are in between, in purgatory.

8 large eggs1In a medium skillet, combine the oil, onion, and basil 
and heat over medium heat for 1 minute, until the onion is slightly softened. Add the canned tomatoes, season with salt and pepper ﬂakes (if using), reduce the heat to low, and cook the sauce for 7 to 8 minutes to thicken slightly.
2Make 8 divots in the sauce using the back of a spoon and carefully crack one egg into each divot. Using a wooden spoon, gently swirl the whites and add a little bit of sauce on top of the yolk, taking care to not break the yolk. Cook the eggs for 3 to 5 minutes, until they are done the way you like.

½ cup whole-milk

1 tablespoon ﬁnely

Add the shredded mozzarella, diced fresh mozzarella,  and ricotta and mix until all the ingredients are combined. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper.
2In a nonstick medium skillet, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Swirl the pan to coat with the oil. Add the egg mixture and cook for about 1 minute undisturbed, until the sides are slightly set.
3Using a silicone spatula, swirl the eggs all around, and bring the edges of the eggs toward the center of the pan. This allows any liquid eggs in the center to ﬂow toward the edges of the pan for even cooking. Con-tinue this process of swirling the eggs and bringing any wet egg from the center to the edges for about 8 minutes. At this point, the frittata should be solidify-ing, while the center will still be slightly undercooked. Leave the frittata undisturbed for 2 or 3 minutes.
4Find a plate with a larger diameter than the skillet. Place it over the pan and conﬁdently invert the frittata onto the plate. Then slide the frittata back into the skillet, top-side down, and cook for 2 to 3 additional minutes, until it’s ﬁrm. Invert again and serve.

A frittata is a classic Italian egg dish served throughout the country. 
Unlike omelets, which are usually prepared in individual servings and served at breakfast, frittate  are prepared in a large pan and usually serve 
3 or 4 people. In Italy, they’re mostly served at lunch and dinner, and not for  breakfast. Y ou can /f_inish them in the oven, but that adds cooking time. Cooking from start to /f_inish on the stovetop cuts the cooking time, and it’s easier than you think.

Add the eggplant. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until the eggplant is nicely browned all over, adding additional oil if needed. Transfer to a plate, leaving any leftover oil in the pan. If there is no leftover oil, add an additional tablespoon.
2Meanwhile, in a 6-quart pot, bring 4 quarts of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook according to the package directions.
3Add the garlic and basil to the sauté pan that the eggplant was cooked in. Set over medium heat and cook for 1 minute, or until the garlic is golden but not burned. Add the tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Cook the sauce for about 13 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it’s slightly thickened. 
4Return the cooked eggplant to the sauce and mix. Drain the pasta and toss it with the tomato sauce in the pan.

After the pasta has cooked for 3 to 4 minutes, add the broccoli rabe ﬂorets to the same pot and continue cooking together for an additional 7 to 8 minutes, taking care to not overcook the pasta. 
2Meanwhile, in a large sauté pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and pepper ﬂakes and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes, until the garlic is golden but not burned.
3Reserving about ¼ cup of the pasta water, drain the orecchiette and broccoli rabe and add them to  the sauté pan. Add the pasta water and mix well  to  combine. Season with salt.

2Meanwhile, in a large sauté pan, heat the oil and butter over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, garlic, wine, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms have softened.
3Reserving about ¼ cup of the pasta water, drain the pasta and add it to the sauté pan. Add the basil and continue cooking for several minutes, until the pasta is fully cooked. Add the reserved pasta water if you want a thicker sauce—the starch in the water will thicken it up. 
4Serve immediately. If desired, top with grated cheese.

Classic Chicken Cutlets

It doesn’t get any more classic than chicken cutlets coated in egg wash and 
dipped in a mixture of breadcrumbs and lots of Parmesan. /T_his dish is served all over Italy and is a favorite for families with young kids. While the classic is 
chicken, you can substitute veal cutlets, which cook in even less time, or turkey cutlets, which are usually a little bit thicker and require a few more minutes of cooking time. Panzanella (page 29) would make a nice contorno  (side dish) for 
these fried cutlets.

/P.sc/r.sc/e.sc/p.sc /t.sc/i.sc/m.sc/e.sc:  10 minutes
/C.sc/o.sc/o.sc/k.sc /t.sc/i.sc/m.sc/e.sc:  20 minutes
1 cup all-purpose ﬂour
3 large eggs
2 cups ﬁne breadcrumbs 
(preferably from a bakery)
1 cup grated 
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
8 thin-sliced chicken 
breast cutlets
Sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Vegetable oil, for frying1Set up a dredging station with three medium bowls. 
Place the ﬂour in one bowl. In the next bowl, lightly beat the eggs with a fork. In the third bowl, combine the breadcrumbs and Parmigiano and blend with a fork or your ﬁngers.
2Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Dredge each chicken cutlet in the ﬂour, shaking oﬀ the excess. Next dip them in the eggs, holding them above the plate so the excess egg can drip oﬀ. Then add the chicken to the breadcrumb–cheese mixture and turn to coat evenly, patting the mixture with your hands to help it adhere to the chicken. Place the breaded cutlets on a plate.
3Line a large plate with two layers of paper towels. 
4In a large sauté pan, add enough oil to fully submerge the cutlets (the exact amount depends on the size of your pan). Heat the oil over medium heat to 350°F. (If you don’t have a thermometer, dip the end of a wooden spoon into the oil. If bubbles appear on the surface of the spoon, the oil is hot enough.) 
5Working in batches of 2 or 3, add the cutlets to the hot oil and cook for about 3 minutes per side, until the coating is golden brown all over. Transfer the cooked cutlets to the paper towels. Season with salt and serve hot.79 - /P.sc/o.sc/u.sc/l.sc/t.sc/r.sc/y.sc /a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /M.sc/e.sc/a.sc/t.sc /M.sc/a.sc/i.sc/n.sc/s.sc _

a bit of dry white wine, but if you don’t have any on hand, add the

4 thin-sliced chicken

Sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper
½ cup all-purpose ﬂour
3 tablespoons olive 
oil, divided
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
¼ small yellow or white 
onion, ﬁnely chopped
2 garlic cloves, ﬁnely minced
½ cup dry white wine
½ cup chicken or

1 (12-ounce) bag 
baby spinach
¾ cup heavy cream1Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Place the 
ﬂour on a plate and dredge the cutlets in the ﬂour on both sides, shaking oﬀ the excess. Discard any leftover ﬂour.
2In a large sauté pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-low heat. Add the chicken and cook for about 4 minutes on each side, until the cutlets are lightly browned on both sides. Remove from the pan and set aside.
3To the same pan, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil, the butter, onion, and garlic and cook for 1 minute, or until the garlic is slightly golden but not burned, scraping up any bits from the bottom of the pan.
4Increase the heat to medium and add the wine and stock. Stir for 30 or so seconds. Add the spinach and cook down for about 2 minutes, or until it’s wilted. Add the cream, mix well, and bring the cream to a boil, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes.
5Return the chicken to the pan and cook for 2 minutes to reheat it in the sauce. Remove from the heat and serve hot, spooning the sauce on top.

Piccata  refers to a dish in which meat is pounded /f_lat (for easier and faster 
cooking) and served with a lemon and caper sauce, o/f_ten made creamy 
by the addition of butter. Chicken is one of the most common meats used 
in a piccata, but you can substitute veal or turkey cutlets. And to save time, this starts with store-bought thin-sliced chicken cutlets so you don’t have to pound them. /T_his dish doesn’t have any added veggies, but Leccese-Style Sweet Peppers (page 61) would pair nicely.

2 tablespoons capers, rinsed1Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Place the 
ﬂour on a plate and dredge the cutlets in the ﬂour on both sides, shaking oﬀ the excess. Discard any leftover ﬂour.
2In a large sauté pan, heat 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-low heat. Add the chicken and cook for 4 minutes on each side, or until the chicken is lightly browned on both sides. Remove from the pan and set aside.
3Increase the heat to medium and add the remaining 1 tablespoon each of butter and oil. Add the garlic, cook for 1 minute, and scrape up any bits that have stuck to the bottom of the pan. Add the stock, lemon zest, and lemon juice and cook the sauce for 5 minutes to slightly reduce and thicken. Stir in the capers.
4Return the chicken to the pan and cook for 2 minutes to reheat in the sauce. Remove from the heat and serve hot, spooning the sauce on top.
/V.sc/a.sc/r.sc/i.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc: This sauce works wonderfully with seafood, 
too. Swap the chicken for tilapia, use vegetable stock instead

Marsala is a forti/f_ied Italian wine o/f_ten used in poultry and veal dishes—
and, because of its sweetness, in desserts. Chicken or turkey Marsala is a popular restaurant dish that sounds far more complicated to pre-
pare than it actually is. It’s impressive enough for company but easy enough for any weeknight.

2 garlic cloves, minced
½ cup Marsala wine
½ cup chicken stock1If the turkey cutlets are thicker than /one.sup⁄8 inch, pound 
them thinner. Season the turkey with salt and pepper. 
Place the ﬂour on a plate and dredge the cutlets in it, shaking oﬀ the excess. Discard any leftover ﬂour.
2In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add/uni00A0the turkey and cook for about 5 minutes per side, or until the cutlets are lightly golden all over. Remove them from the pan and set aside.
3Reduce the heat to low and add the mushrooms, onion, and garlic and sauté for 5 minutes. Add an additional tablespoon of oil, if needed. Scrape up any bits that are stuck to the bottom of the pan. Add the Marsala and cook for about 1 minute, until it evap-orates slightly. Add the stock, increase the heat to medium, and bring the sauce to a light boil, reducing the liquid slightly.
4Return the turkey to the pan and simmer for an additional 1 minute to reheat. Serve the turkey hot with the sauce spooned over the top.
/P.sc/a.sc/i.sc/r.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc /t.sc/i.sc/p.sc: A Pinot Noir will complement this dish

I must confess, growing up in Italy, I ate a lot of rabbit served in this style. 
Once we moved to the United States, we cooked chicken and turkey this way instead because good-quality rabbit was (and still is) hard to /f_ind. Using 
turkey cutlets in this recipe really cuts down on the cooking time. Unlike many recipes where the wine evaporates quickly at a high heat, in this dish the turkey and wine cook together for a good amount of time, ensuring that the turkey is really /f_lavored with the wine. Round this dish out with some Vegetable Kebabs (page 67) for a very satisfying dinner.

1 (14.5-ounce) can

2Add the wine and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes, reducing the heat if the wine is evaporating too quickly.
3Add the garlic, basil, rosemary, and oregano and stir to combine. Add the tomatoes and water. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes to thicken the sauce. 
4Discard the rosemary stem. Serve the turkey hot with the sauce spooned over the top.
/V.sc/a.sc/r.sc/i.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc: This recipe is very versatile, so feel free to use 
any kind of meat. Boneless or bone-in chicken thighs and 
pork chops work very well cooked in this matter. The key is to make sure the meat cooks in the wine for a substantial period to really ﬂavor it. Adding the onion is also key because it will release lots of water. 85 - /P.sc/o.sc/u.sc/l.sc/t.sc/r.sc/y.sc /a.sc/n.sc/d.sc /M.sc/e.sc/a.sc/t.sc /M.sc/a.sc/i.sc/n.sc/s.sc _

It’s very common in northern Italy to add cream and butter to many dishes. 
Unlike in the south, where cooks thrive on putting extra-virgin olive oil on just about anything, northern Italians enjoy heavier cream and butter sauces. 
Each region makes use of what they most have available, which is the beauty of Italian cuisine. Northerners have more cattle, while southerners have more olive trees, so it’s not a mystery why each region cooks the way it does.

Veal Milanese

A classic recipe from the city of Milan, this dish is utterly decadent, as it’s 
cooked only in butter. /T_he dish calls for just a few ingredients, but all play a very important role in creating a rich, buttery cutlet. /T_he veal chop 
is pounded to a ½-inch thickness so it cooks quickly. Reduce the  cooking time if you’ d prefer a medium-rare chop. Serve this on its own or with Oven-Roasted Stuﬀed Tomatoes (page 65).

2 large eggs
Sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper
4 bone-in veal chops
1½ cups ﬁne breadcrumbs 
(preferably from a bakery)
7 tablespoons unsalted butter
Lemon wedges (optional)1In a medium bowl, lightly beat the eggs with a fork. 
Season with salt and pepper. Line a large plate with paper towels.
2Avoiding the bone, pound the meat of the veal chops until it is about ½ inch thick. Dip the chops in the beaten eggs, then dip them into the breadcrumbs, avoiding the bone. Press the breadcrumbs to better adhere to the meat.
3In a large sauté pan or skillet, heat the butter for 3 to 4 minutes, until the butter is golden but not burned. Working in batches if necessary, cook the veal chops for 4 to 5 minutes per side. If the chops are browning too quickly, reduce the heat to medium.
4Transfer the chops to the paper towels to drain for 1 minute before serving. If desired, serve with lemon wedges for squeezing.
/P.sc/a.sc/i.sc/r.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc /t.sc/i.sc/p.sc: Veal is delicate, so even though this dish 
is cooked in butter, you want to select a wine that isn’t too

Lemons and capers seem to go hand in hand and are o/f_ten paired to create 
lemony sauces. Lamb chops also go very well with anything lemon. Lamb can taste gamey, but the addition of ingredients with bold /f_lavors, such as 
wine, stock, and lemons, balances that unique taste.

Alla pizzaiola  typically refers to dishes that use tomatoes and oregano—
ingredients o/f_ten found on pizza. It’s a method of cooking that 
Neapolitans are known for, and they cook many dishes in this style. 
Rib-eye steaks are ideal for cooking alla pizzaiola  because they are tender and

Braciole refers to thin slices of meat (usually beef), or even vegetables, that 
are rolled around a stuﬃng of some type; the roll-ups are also referred to as involtine . /T_hese tender bites of deliciousness are the perfect weeknight

8 thin slices deli-style 
provolone
8 thin slices pancetta
¼ cup grated 
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup dry white wine1Season the meat with salt and pepper. On each 
slice of meat, add 1 slice of provolone and 1 slice of pancetta. Sprinkle a pinch of Parmigiano on top and roll up the meat slices tightly, paying close attention to the sides to ensure they’re closed. Stick a wooden toothpick in the seams of each roll-up to keep them closed, or use some kitchen twine to tie them closed.
2In a large sauté pan or skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the beef roll-ups and brown for 5 minutes, turning to evenly brown them on all sides.
3Reduce the heat to low, add the wine, season with additional salt and pepper, and stir. Cover the pan and cook the braciole for about 10 minutes, or until fully cooked. Serve hot.
/V.sc/a.sc/r.sc/i.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc: Serving any dish in bianco means without 
adding tomatoes, but this dish is also wonderful rosso, 
 meaning with tomatoes. Add 1 cup of canned crushed 
tomatoes after adding the wine; the end result will be a lovely tomato sauce, which is great for mopping up with some crusty bread.SAUTÉED MUSSELS AND CLAMS, PAGE 963 88888888888 13 88888888888 1

Italian tuna packed in olive oil is a staple ingredient in my pantry that I use in 
countless ways. /T_his dish is similar to a pasta salad, and it’s wonderful served hot or at room temperature. Feel free to add some capers in step 3; they lend 
saltiness and a bit of tang.
/S.sc/e.sc/r.sc/v.sc/e.sc/s.sc 4

/C.sc/o.sc/o.sc/k.sc /t.sc/i.sc/m.sc/e.sc:  15 minutes
Sea salt
12 ounces penne, ziti, or 
other tubular pasta
2 (5.5-ounce) cans 
tuna packed in olive oil, 
drained, oil reserved
2 tablespoons olive oil, 
plus more if needed
½ small yellow or white 
onion, chopped
5 anchovy ﬁllets packed 
in oil, roughly chopped
1 pint cherry 
tomatoes, halved
¼ cup chopped pitted 
black olives
2 tablespoons chopped 
fresh parsley
½ cup dry white wine1In a 6-quart pot, bring 4 quarts of salted water to 
a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook to 2 minutes less than the package directions.
2Meanwhile, in a large sauté pan, combine the drained oil from the tuna, the olive oil, and onion. Set over medium heat and cook for 2 minutes, or until the onion is softened and slightly translucent. Add the anchovies and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until they almost melt into the oil.
3Add the tuna, tomatoes, olives, and parsley. Increase the heat to high and sauté for 3 minutes. Add the wine and let it evaporate for 2 minutes.
4Reserving about ½ cup of the pasta water, drain the pasta and add it to the sauce. Mix well to combine, adding a little more olive oil if needed. Add some pasta water if it seems too dry.
5Cook the pasta with the sauce for 2 minutes to fully incorporate the ﬂavors of the sauce. Taste and season with salt. Serve hot or at room temperature.
/I.sc/n.sc/g.sc/r.sc/e.sc/d.sc/i.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc /t.sc/i.sc/p.sc: The anchovies and olives both pack some 
salt, as does the pasta cooked in salted water. That’s why I 
recommend waiting to season with added salt until the end. Taste the ﬁnal dish and adjust as needed.95 - /S.sc/e.sc/a.sc/f.sc/o.sc/o.sc/d.sc /M.sc/a.sc/i.sc/n.sc/s.sc _

Fritto misto di mare is a beloved southern Italian dish that uses a bounty of 
seafood. Surrounded by the ocean, regions such as Calabria, Sicily, and Puglia make use of what is most readily available. /T_his dish is best enjoyed 
hot, right out of the oil, so prepare it just before serving. Coat the /f_ish in the /f_lour immediately before frying so the /f_lour will not have time to moisten and get soggy; you’ll end up with a crunchier coating.

Sunﬂower oil or vegetable 
oil, for deep-frying
½ pound small sea scallops
16 large peeled and 
deveined shrimp
1 pound cleaned squid, bodies 
sliced into rings (see Tip)
½ pound cod, cut into 
2- to 3-inch cubes
Sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2 cups all-purpose ﬂour
Lemon wedges, for serving1Fill a large sauté pan or deep-fryer three-quarters full 
with oil and heat the oil to 350°F. (If you don’t have a thermometer, dip the end of a wooden spoon into the oil. If bubbles appear on the surface of the wood, the oil is hot enough.) Line a large dish with paper towels.
2While the oil is heating, season the scallops, shrimp, squid, and cod with salt and pepper. Add the ﬂour to a large bowl and dredge the seafood in the ﬂour, shaking oﬀ the excess. Discard any leftover ﬂour.
3Add the seafood to the hot oil (take care not to splatter) in separate batches in this order: First, scallops and shrimp, which will cook in less than 1 minute. Then the squid, which will fry in just about 1½ minutes. End with the cod, which will cook in 2 to 3 minutes, depending on the  thickness; the outside will be golden. When the  seafood is cooked, remove from the hot oil with a slotted spoon and drain on the paper towels.
4Transfer everything to a clean plate, season with salt, and serve with lemon wedges.
/P.sc/a.sc/i.sc/r.sc/i.sc/n.sc/g.sc /t.sc/i.sc/p.sc: A Sauvignon Blanc is the perfect wine

This quick, simple, light meal is the perfect option for those nights when 
you have only a few minutes to spare in the kitchen. /T_he shrimp are cooked when they change color to light pink or light orange, which usu-
ally happens a/f_ter they have been on the heat for just a few minutes. Lemon  complements  seafood dishes really well on its own, but when paired with wine 
the  resulting sauce is even more tempting. Cook some angel hair pasta for a more 
 substantial meal.

1 pound peeled and

1 cup dry white wine1In a large sauté pan, heat the oil over medium heat. 
Add the garlic and lemon zest and cook for 1 minute, or until the garlic is golden but not burned.
2Season the shrimp with salt and pepper and add to the pan, along with the parsley. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp turn pink and are fully cooked through.

Scallops, and many other types of seafood, are the perfect weeknight option 
because of their quick cooking time. Here, they are  prepared alla pizzaiola,  
meaning the dish is going to have a good amount of oregano, tomatoes, 
and basil—all ingredients typically found on pizza. A  favorite from the city of 
Naples, the key in this dish is to leave the scallops  undisturbed as they sear on the hot oil. /T_his will result in a golden outer crust.

Sea salt
12 ounces angel hair pasta
4 tablespoons olive 
oil, divided
1 pound medium scallops
Freshly ground black pepper
2 garlic cloves, minced
3 tablespoons chopped 
fresh basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
¼ cup dry white wine
2 cups canned 
crushed tomatoes1In a 6-quart pot, bring 4 quarts of salted water to 
a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook for 1 minute less than the package directions.
2Meanwhile, in a large sauté pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Season the scallops with salt and pepper and add to the hot pan. Do not disturb the scallops for 2 minutes, then ﬂip them and sear on the other side undisturbed for an additional 2 minutes. Remove them from the pan and set aside.
3Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, the garlic, basil, oregano, and wine. Deglaze the pan by scraping up any bits that have stuck from the scallops and allow the wine to evaporate for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, stir, and cook for 5 to 6 minutes to slightly thicken the sauce.
4Return the scallops to the sauce to reheat for 1 minute. Drain the pasta and add it to the sauté pan. Toss to combine. Serve hot.101 - /S.sc/e.sc/a.sc/f.sc/o.sc/o.sc/d.sc /M.sc/a.sc/i.sc/n.sc/s.sc _

Baccalà alla napolitana is a spicy seafood dish from the city of Naples. 
Traditionally served on Christmas Eve, when many Italians abstain from eating meat, this dish certainly packs a punch from the red pepper /f_lakes, 
capers, and olives. /T_he amount of red pepper /f_lakes is completely up to you, and you could omit them altogether for a milder taste. In Italy, this dish is made with both fresh cod and salt cod, which has to be soaked in water for  several days before you can cook with it. Obviously several days of soaking doesn’t work for a quick recipe, so this is the fresh cod version of the dish.

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 (28-ounce) can 
crushed tomatoes
Red pepper ﬂakes
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 cup water
2 tablespoons capers, rinsed
½ cup pitted and 
halved black olives
1½ pounds cod loin ﬁllet, cut 
into 4- to 5-inch portions
Sea salt1In a large sauté pan (large enough to hold the ﬁsh 
without crowding), heat the oil over medium-low heat for 30 seconds. Add the garlic and parsley and cook for 1 minute, or until the garlic is slightly golden but not burned. Add the crushed tomatoes, pepper ﬂakes to taste, the oregano, and water. Cook the sauce for 10 minutes to slightly thicken. Add the capers and olives and mix well.
2Gently add the ﬁsh to the sauce. With a wooden spoon, cover the ﬁsh with some of the sauce. Simmer the ﬁsh in the sauce for 12 to 15 minutes, until the cod is tender and begins to ﬂake. Check on the ﬁsh a few times while cooking to make sure it’s not drying out too quickly. If it is, reduce the heat to low and add several tablespoons of water.
3Taste the sauce and season with salt as needed. The capers and olives will provide some saltiness. Serve hot.

is arguably one of the most famous cocktails in Italy. It’s sweet, fruity, and enjoyed by everyone who has ever had the pleasure of sipping one.

Italians love fruit for dessert, and summertime is the peak season for a 
 wonderful fruit macedonia . /T_here is no cooking involved, so the bulk of your 
time will be spent cutting up the mixed fruits. Although there is no exact 
recipe for this, I think the proposed combination that follows works perfectly. /T_his is best served the same day it is prepared; by the next day, the fruits will have released some of their juices, making the dish a bit soggy and discolored.

topping (see Tip,

tarines, strawberries, cantaloupe, honeydew, and lemon juice and mix well. Add the orange juice and honey and mix well. Taste for sweetness and adjust as needed by adding more honey if necessary.

2In a medium bowl, combine the brown sugar, amaretti crumbs, and vanilla and use a fork to mix thoroughly. Set the crumble aside.
3Set the peach halves cut-side up in a baking dish or sheet pan. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the amaretti crumble in the hollow left by the peach pit and use your ﬁngers to pack it in. Add a small dab of butter on each peach half.
4Transfer to the oven and bake for about 15 minutes, or until the peach ﬂesh is softened. Turn the oven to broil and broil the peaches for 1 to 2 minutes, until the crumble is toasted.
5As the peaches bake, add the chocolate to a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 30-second increments, stirring after each, until it’s melted.

A classic Sicilian dessert, cannoli are tubes of fried dough /f_illed with a 
smooth and creamy mixture of ricotta cheese. Purchasing premade shells saves hours of time in the kitchen, and when you don’t have to fry the 
shells, cleanup is a snap. /T_here are several options online for diﬀerent size shells; you can also check your local grocery store’s bakery  department. Because the /f_ill-ing is made from only a few ingredients, purchase the best ricotta you can /f_ind, made from whole milk.

/P.sc/r.sc/e.sc/p.sc /t.sc/i.sc/m.sc/e.sc:  15 minutes
½ cup heavy whipping cream
½ cup powdered sugar,

4 cups whole-milk 
ricotta cheese
8 large cannoli shells
8 maraschino cherries, 
halved (optional)
½ cup mini chocolate 
chips (optional)1In a medium bowl, with an electric mixer with the 
whisk attachment, whip the cream and powdered sugar until stiﬀ peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes.
2Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the ricotta into the whipped cream. Mix just until combined; do not overmix.
3Using a pastry bag or a plastic freezer bag with the bottom corner cut oﬀ, pipe the cream into the shells. If desired, you can decorate the cannoli with a half maraschino cherry at one or both ends, or dip one or both ends into the chocolate chips, or mix and match the cherries and chocolate. Set on a serving platter and dust with powdered sugar. Serve immediately.
/I.sc/n.sc/g.sc/r.sc/e.sc/d.sc/i.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc /t.sc/i.sc/p.sc: Cannoli shells are best ﬁlled immediately 
before serving, so prepare the cream when you’re done with 
dinner and ready to serve dessert. You can refrigerate the ﬁlled cannoli for up to 1 day, but expect the shells to get a bit soggy. Maraschino cherries and mini chocolate chips make excellent additions to this dessert, but chopped pistachios would also work wonderfully.112 - /three.taboldstyle/zero.taboldstyle-/m.sc/i.sc/n.sc/u.sc/t.sc/e.sc /i.sc/t.sc/a.sc/l.sc/i.sc/a.sc/n.sc /c.sc/o.sc/o.sc/k.sc/b.sc/o.sc/o.sc/k.sc _

Ideal for social gatherings or for a super-easy weeknight dessert, this dip 
is perfect to end any meal or simply for a sweet a/f_ternoon snack. /T_he  unmistakable /f_lavor of mascarpone and espresso go together beautifully  
with the lady/f_ingers, which are the cookies traditionally used in tiramisu.
/S.sc/e.sc/r.sc/v.sc/e.sc/s.sc 4 to 6
/P.sc/r.sc/e.sc/p.sc /t.sc/i.sc/m.sc/e.sc:  10 minutes
1 pound mascarpone cheese
¼ cup freshly brewed 
espresso, cooled
½ cup powdered sugar
1 (8-ounce) container 
frozen whipped topping, 
thawed (see Tip)
Shaved chocolate (optional)
24 ladyﬁngers1In a stand mixer with the whisk (or in a bowl with a 
handheld mixer), whisk the mascarpone, espresso, and powdered sugar on low speed for 1 to 2 minutes.
2Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in the whipped topping and mix until combined. Transfer to a serving bowl. If desired, top with some shaved chocolate.
3Serve the cream with ladyﬁngers for dipping.
/V.sc/a.sc/r.sc/i.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc: While this cream makes the perfect dip 
for ladyﬁngers, it’s also wonderful as a ﬁlling or frosting 
 alternative on homemade chocolate cupcakes. Use a piping bag to ﬁll them, or simply smear some cream on top in place of frosting.
/I.sc/n.sc/g.sc/r.sc/e.sc/d.sc/i.sc/e.sc/n.sc/t.sc /t.sc/i.sc/p.sc: If you’d prefer, make homemade 
whipped cream with 1 cup heavy whipping cream and /one.sup⁄3 cup 
 powdered sugar.5 INGREDIENTS OR FEWER •  NUT-FREE •  VEGETARIAN11

1ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
To my mom, Celeste Montillo, whom I treasure dearly and who is my constant culinary 
critic, making me a better home cook in the process—thank you for your direction, in life and in the kitchen. To my sister, Roseanne Montillo, who years ago insisted I write a cookbook. Now, three books later, none of them would have been possible without your initial nudge.
And a big thank you  to my Zoom culinary students. I never would have thought  
I would be teaching cooking over Zoom, but the pandemic pushed my business that  way, and I never would have known the hundreds of students I have had the privilege of meeting if not for this method of teaching. So thank you to all of you, from the  bottom of my heart.
