(Text)“ONE CANNOT THINK WELL, LOVE WELL, SLEEP WELL, UNLESS ONE HAS DINED WELL,”  
WROTE VIRGINIA WOOLF . SHE WAS RIGHT—BUT SHE FORGOT ONE THING: ONE MUST  
DRINK WELL, TOO. AND THAT’S WHERE APERITIFS COME IN. A PERFECTLY-CRAFTED  
PRE-DINNER COCKTAIL CAN ACCOMPLISH WHAT NEARLY AMOUNTS TO MAGIC: IT CAN  PREPARE YOUR PALATE (AND YOUR STOMACH) FOR AN EXCELLENT MEAL; IT CAN RESTORE  DROOPING SPIRITS AFTER A LONG DAY AT THE OFFICE (AFTER ALL, YOU CAN’T ENJOY  DINNER WHEN YOU’RE STRESSED OUT, CAN YOU?); AND IT’S A GREAT POTABLE PARTNER  FOR FINGER FOOD LIKE TAPAS, HORS O’OEUVRES, OR OTHER NIBBLES.And aperitifs have long been part of the fabulous food cultures of France and Italy, 
where diners might enjoy pastis or an Aperol spritz before a leisurely lunch or dinner. 
Historically, though, aperitifs weren’t created only to be pleasurable complements to 
food; they were also a way to administer medicinal herbs and spices that could ease the effects 
of the many belly-related maladies that plagued our ancestors before the age of refrigeration, 
such as indigestion and food poisoning. These valuable (and often expensive) botanicals were 
preserved in a suspension of alcohol, and the resulting liqueur would often have been bitter to 
the taste—which is why so many aperitifs have such strong, bracing flavors. Other alcoholic 
“tonics” were created in days gone by in order to cure a specific ailment: for instance, Dubonnet, 
a type of quinine-laden vermouth, was developed by a French chemist and wine merchant of the 
same name in the mid-nineteenth century in order to combat malaria. But since quinine’s taste 
was so bitter, Monsieur Dubonnet concocted a secret recipe of botanicals to mask its flavor (it’s 
closely-guarded to this day), and voila!—a popular pre-prandial tipple was born.  
 Want to get in on the action? You’ve come to the right place. This chapter shows you how 
to make mouthwatering aperitifs that are sure to put you in the mood for food. Some are 
tried-and-true classics, like the Pretty-Close-to-Normal Manhattan on page 10 or the Classic 
Old-Fashioned on page 18, while others feature a couple Cocktail-Whisperer-style twists, like 
the Oblique Manhattan on page 10 (hint: it involves absinthe!) or the Bitter, Twisted Sidecar 
on page 16, which adds a dash of my homemade Italian Blood Orange and Charred Rosemary 
Shrub to the traditional triumvirate of brandy, Cointreau, and freshly squeezed lemon juice. And 
there are a couple surprises, too: for instance, if you haven’t been making beer cocktails yet, now’s the time to start—and for “now” read “before dinner,” because beer actually makes an excellent 
aperitivo (in the right hands, of course). Or, if rum’s your thing, invest in a good bottle of Rhum 
Agricole and whip up the Ginger-Lime Rum Daiquiri on page 26: there’s no better way to rouse 
a recalcitrant appetite, especially on a sultry summer’s evening. 
 Word to the wise, though: Be sensible when it comes to enjoying aperitifs, especially if you’re 
planning on drinking alcohol with dinner, too. Stick to a single drink, or two at the most: there’s 
no point giving that hangover a headstart.

(Text)A PRETTY-CLOSE-TO-NORMAL MANHATTAN 
AN OBLIQUE MANHATTANSince it’s a twentieth-century classic, you’re probably already familiar with the Manhattan, at 
least in theory. Perhaps your mom drank one on the rocks every evening before dinner. Or maybe 
your beer-loving great-uncle used to mix himself a straight-up Manhattan once in awhile, on 
special occasions. Just like Mom and Great-Uncle Harold, the Manhattan is one of my favorite 
“normal” cocktails (for “normal,” read “un-Cocktail-Whisperified”). Its ingredients are as simple 
as could be, and it’s just as easy to prepare. Aside from the rye whiskey, there’s nothing at all 
to add but bitters and sweet vermouth—but do feel free to play the field when it comes to the 
vermouth. Whichever way you craft your Manhattan, as long as you make it with rye whiskey, 
all will be well.
Every bartender knows how to make a Manhattan—but the beauty of its simplicity is that it 
can sustain so many variations. Its recipe is a template that creative mixologists love to tinker 
with. And I’m one of them. While the standard version is usually made with whiskey, sweet ver-
mouth, and bitters, my Oblique Manhattan combines bourbon, a dose of my delectable Spiced 
Cherry Shrub, and a whisper of absinthe. (According to some sources, very early versions of the 
Manhattan originally included absinthe, so I like to think that my variation on the theme tips 
its hat to a proto-Manhattan now lost to the mists of time.) Bitters and an orange zest twist are 
a traditionally inspired finish to my twisted Manhattan. It’s a peerless pre-dinner drink: Serve it 
with just about any kind of hors d’oeuvre—or be a purist, and enjoy it on its own.     _ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) RYE WHISKEY

(Text)VIEUX CARRÉ COCKTAIL
Rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, and a dash of bitters: sounds like a Manhattan, doesn’t it? Not quite. 
The Vieux Carré may be a cousin of the Manhattan, but it’s got a charm all its own—and it dates 
back to an original recipe from the historic Hotel Monteleone in New Orleans, where perking up 
flagging appetites with carefully-concocted, alcoholic curatives was the order of the day.
_ 1 OUNCE (25 ML) RYE WHISKEY
_ 1 OUNCE (25 ML) COGNAC_ 1 OUNCE (25 ML) SWEET VERMOUTH_ 2 TO 3 SHAKES PEYCHAUD’S BITTERS
_ 2 TO 3 SHAKES ANGOSTURA BITTERS_ 1/2 OUNCE (15 ML) BÉNÉDICTINE  _ LEMON ZEST TWIST  INGREDIENTS
Peychaud’s bitters  are a New Orleans–based brand of aromatic 
bitters that were originally intended to heal stomach maladies of all sorts. 
And they’ve been around for nearly two centuries. French-born phar -
macist Antoine Peychaud developed his recipe for bitters in 1830—long 
before safe food-handling practices became de rigueur—and his soothing 
recipe contained anise, cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg (along with copious 
amounts of brandy, of course). For a time, Peychaud’s combination of 
herbs, spices, and alcohol was available only in pharmacies, and was even 
meant to ease the symptoms of more serious diseases such as dysentery 
and ulcers. DIRECTIONS
Add the rye whiskey, cognac, vermouth, bitters, and Bénédictine 
to a mixing glass over a couple handfuls of ice. Mix well, 
then strain into a short rocks glass. Twist the lemon zest 
over the edge of the glass, and sip slowly. Hungry yet?

(Text)VIEUX CARRÉ COCKTAIL
Rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, and a dash of bitters: sounds like a Manhattan, doesn’t it? Not quite. 
The Vieux Carré may be a cousin of the Manhattan, but it’s got a charm all its own—and it dates 
back to an original recipe from the historic Hotel Monteleone in New Orleans, where perking up 
flagging appetites with carefully-concocted, alcoholic curatives was the order of the day.
_ 1 OUNCE (25 ML) RYE WHISKEY
_ 1 OUNCE (25 ML) COGNAC_ 1 OUNCE (25 ML) SWEET VERMOUTH_ 2 TO 3 SHAKES PEYCHAUD’S BITTERS
_ 2 TO 3 SHAKES ANGOSTURA BITTERS_ 1/2 OUNCE (15 ML) BÉNÉDICTINE  _ LEMON ZEST TWIST  INGREDIENTS
Peychaud’s bitters  are a New Orleans–based brand of aromatic 
bitters that were originally intended to heal stomach maladies of all sorts. 
And they’ve been around for nearly two centuries. French-born phar -
macist Antoine Peychaud developed his recipe for bitters in 1830—long 
before safe food-handling practices became de rigueur—and his soothing 
recipe contained anise, cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg (along with copious 
amounts of brandy, of course). For a time, Peychaud’s combination of 
herbs, spices, and alcohol was available only in pharmacies, and was even 
meant to ease the symptoms of more serious diseases such as dysentery 
and ulcers. DIRECTIONS
Add the rye whiskey, cognac, vermouth, bitters, and Bénédictine 
to a mixing glass over a couple handfuls of ice. Mix well, 
then strain into a short rocks glass. Twist the lemon zest 
over the edge of the glass, and sip slowly. Hungry yet?

(Text)ALMOND PASTIS THE GRENADIER COCKTAIL 
Pastis is one of the most popular drinks in France, especially in the nation’s southern and 
southwestern regions, where scorching heat can accompany the summer months. The French, 
undisputed masters of all things gastronomic, rely on this simple cocktail of aniseed-flavored 
liqueur diluted with water and served over ice to keep that stifling, appetite-muffling heat at 
bay. It can be enjoyed as an aperitif, digestif, or even on its own during those long, warm after-
noons. Here, an infusion of orgeat—that is, almond-flavored—syrup acts as a delicious foil to 
the liqueur’s bitter edge. If you like, you can substitute Turkish raki for the Pernod—both work 
equally well.

the classic Tequila Sunrise cocktail, it combines tequila, citrus juice and grenadine—but it’s not 
your everyday mix of budget tequila, concentrated orange juice, and bottled, artificially colored 
grenadine syrup. No way, man. Reposado tequila, three types of freshly squeezed citrus juice, and 
homemade grenadine mean serious mixological business is happening here. And a final flourish 
of homemade bitters turns the Grenadier into a truly elegant aperitif. Relax: Making your own 
grenadine is really easy, and it’s so much better than the stuff you get from a bottle or a can.

(Text)BITTER, TWISTED SIDECAR
We all know and love the Sidecar, a tart threesome of brandy, Cointreau, and freshly squeezed 
lemon juice. Named for the motorcycle attachment (although the reasons for this are nothing 
if not obscure), the sidecar is a staple of twenty-first century cocktail bars everywhere. And 
it’s guaranteed to get your appetite up and running. I like to add a few variations to the theme, 
though. Here, a whisper of absinthe coats the glass; my Italian Blood Orange and Charred 
Rosemary Shrub replaces the traditional Cointreau; and a couple drops of my homemade bitters 
round things off nicely. And don’t forget to frost the rim of the glass. Pour a little freshly squeezed lemon juice into a saucer; dunk the rim in the juice; and then dunk it into a saucer of sugar that’s been mixed with the tiniest pinch of cayenne pepper.

What are shrubs?  Don’t be misled by the name: the kind of shrubs 
we’re talking about here bear little relation to the decorative bushes in your 
front yard. Shrubs truly were the original energy drinks, and they were espe -
cially popular during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These 
early shrubs consisted of little more than a sweetening agent, like honey 
or sugar, combined with water and vinegar, but that simple combination of sweet, tart, and savory makes for a really refreshing, revitalizing 
beverage. Thirst-slaking shrubs were the soft drinks of their era, before 
fizzy, sugary soda pop exploded onto the market. 
Today, shrubs have captured the attention of top mixologists, many of whom 
are interested in how cocktail history can be re-imagined in contemporary 
craft cocktails. Professionals and home bartenders alike are attracted by 
shrubs’ deep, concentrated flavors and their funky, sweet-tart aromatics. 
And the best part is, shrubs are really easy to make at home. Just about 
any type of fruit or vegetable you can think of can be made into a shrub—and, while there are usually several steps in the shrub-making process, 
it’s actually pretty simple. The process generally goes like this: Fruits 
or vegetables are combined with sugar or simple syrup and spices in a 
nonreactive bowl. After leaving them to sit for about twenty-four hours in 
order to promote natural fermentation, the fruit-sugar mixture is crushed or pressed to release the intensely flavored juices. Then the juices are 
mixed with vinegar and left to sit for up to several weeks to combine. (Not 
always, though: some shrub recipes, like the ones in this chapter, can be 
made much more quickly.) The result? A concentrated, flavorful “liqueur” 
that adds layers of character to each sip of your homemade cocktails. APERITIFS •

if not obscure), the sidecar is a staple of twenty-first century cocktail bars everywhere. And 
it’s guaranteed to get your appetite up and running. I like to add a few variations to the theme, 
though. Here, a whisper of absinthe coats the glass; my Italian Blood Orange and Charred 
Rosemary Shrub replaces the traditional Cointreau; and a couple drops of my homemade bitters 
round things off nicely. And don’t forget to frost the rim of the glass. Pour a little freshly squeezed lemon juice into a saucer; dunk the rim in the juice; and then dunk it into a saucer of sugar that’s been mixed with the tiniest pinch of cayenne pepper.  
Swirl a few drops of the absinthe around a coupe glass, then 
pour the absinthe out (into your mouth: no wasting good 
liquor!) Set aside. Fill a cocktail mixing glass three-quarters 
full with ice. Add the cognac, the shrub, and the lemon juice, 
then stir 40 times to cool. Using a Hawthorne strainer, strain the mixture into the absinthe-cured coupe glass. Dot with my 
Raw Honey Aromatic Bitters, and serve to an appreciative 
friend. Then make another for yourself. Guests first, of course!SIDENOTE
What are shrubs?  Don’t be misled by the name: the kind of shrubs 
we’re talking about here bear little relation to the decorative bushes in your 
front yard. Shrubs truly were the original energy drinks, and they were espe -
cially popular during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These 
early shrubs consisted of little more than a sweetening agent, like honey 
or sugar, combined with water and vinegar, but that simple combination of sweet, tart, and savory makes for a really refreshing, revitalizing 
beverage. Thirst-slaking shrubs were the soft drinks of their era, before 
fizzy, sugary soda pop exploded onto the market. 
Today, shrubs have captured the attention of top mixologists, many of whom 
are interested in how cocktail history can be re-imagined in contemporary 
craft cocktails. Professionals and home bartenders alike are attracted by 
shrubs’ deep, concentrated flavors and their funky, sweet-tart aromatics. 
And the best part is, shrubs are really easy to make at home. Just about 
any type of fruit or vegetable you can think of can be made into a shrub—and, while there are usually several steps in the shrub-making process, 
it’s actually pretty simple. The process generally goes like this: Fruits 
or vegetables are combined with sugar or simple syrup and spices in a 
nonreactive bowl. After leaving them to sit for about twenty-four hours in 
order to promote natural fermentation, the fruit-sugar mixture is crushed or pressed to release the intensely flavored juices. Then the juices are 
mixed with vinegar and left to sit for up to several weeks to combine. (Not 
always, though: some shrub recipes, like the ones in this chapter, can be 
made much more quickly.) The result? A concentrated, flavorful “liqueur” 
that adds layers of character to each sip of your homemade cocktails. APERITIFS •

(Text)THE CLASSIC OLD FASHIONED
The main ingredient in a perfectly crafted Old Fashioned cocktail is love. Sure, there’s been a lot 
of disagreement among mixologists in recent years over the recipe: lots of fruit, or no fruit at all? 
Whichever camp you might be in, the keys to a great Old-Fashioned—a drink that’s truly an 
integral part of American cocktail culture—are patience and passion. My version calls for a slice 
of thickly cut orange rind, instead of the traditional chunks of citrus fruit; singeing the rind with a 
lit match releases its aromatic essential oils, soaking the sugar cube with flavor. And the bitters are 
an important component of this drink, so feel free to experiment a bit. There are so many different 
varieties on the market these days—and some yield fascinating results! I enjoy the process of 
making an Old-Fashioned almost as much as I enjoy sipping one before a leisurely meal.

(USE A PARING KNIFE, NOT A PEELER)   
_ HAND-CUT ICE CUBESINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Place the sugar cube in an old-fashioned glass. Wet the cube with 
the aromatic bitters. Singe the orange zest twist by holding it 
firmly behind a lit match and pinching it to release its natural 
citrus oils. Be careful to spritz the citrus oils into the glass. Place 
the orange zest twist into the glass; using a muddler or the end of 
a wooden spoon, press it gently against the sugar cube. Then add 
the rye whiskey and stir gently. Add a couple large hand-cut ice 
cubes to the glass; stir gently again. Garnish with another orange 
zest twist, and serve. It’s restrained, potable elegance in a glass.

(Text)SLIGHTLY ASKEW OLD-FASHIONED
You’re familiar with the Classic Old-Fashioned. Now, here’s the Cocktail Whisperer’s twisted 
take on it! After all, not to experiment with the Old-Fashioned paradigm would be a crime 
against creativity. At first glance, this cocktail may seem a bit on the complicated side, but it’s 
actually a snap to make. In addition to rye whiskey and belly-friendly Fernet, my version of the 
Old Fashioned involves organic sage tea liqueur, which is a distinctive American liquor made 
from a combination of restorative herbs. Instead of using a flamed orange zest twist, I make this 
cocktail Slightly Askew by using orange wedges that have been soaked in Earl Grey tea over-
night. Italian vermouth brings up the rear here, while the Mexican mole bitters lend the drink an 
earthy simplicity. The finished product is a combination of flavors that’s just astonishing.

Place two Earl Grey–soaked orange segments in the bottom 
of a Boston shaker. Add the rye whiskey, then muddle with 
a muddler or the end of a wooden spoon. Add the Fernet 
Branca, Italian vermouth, and sage tea liqueur. Then fill 
the shaker three-quarters full with ice. Shake for about 15 
seconds. Place a couple of large ice cubes in a rocks glass, and 
strain the mixture into the glass. Drip the bitters into the 
glass, and garnish with an Easy Home-Cured Cocktail Cherry. 
Quite a newfangled take on an old-fashioned classic!

(Text)INSTANT BLOOD ORANGE SHRUBB COCKTAIL ITALIAN BLOOD ORANGE AND CHARRED ROSEMARY SHRUB
This shrubb cocktail is the accelerated version of my Italian Blood Orange Shrub on page 22, 
except it takes minutes, not hours, to make. It’s great with rum, but rye whiskey works just as 
well. And it’s a wonderfully simple, no-fuss aperitif: instant gratification in a glass! The combination of orange and rosemary is a match made in heaven, but what sets my Italian 
Blood Orange Shrub apart from the crowd is its use of charred rosemary, which intensifies the 
shrub’s flavor, and blood oranges, a spunky fruit with blood-red flesh and a taste that lies some-
where between sweet and tart. Bound with citrusy yuzu vinegar and Demerara sugar, this shrub

the charred rosemary (needles only, no wood, please!). Stir to 
coat the oranges and zest with the charred rosemary. Cover with

(Text)INSTANT BLOOD ORANGE SHRUBB COCKTAIL ITALIAN BLOOD ORANGE AND CHARRED ROSEMARY SHRUB
This shrubb cocktail is the accelerated version of my Italian Blood Orange Shrub on page 22, 
except it takes minutes, not hours, to make. It’s great with rum, but rye whiskey works just as 
well. And it’s a wonderfully simple, no-fuss aperitif: instant gratification in a glass! The combination of orange and rosemary is a match made in heaven, but what sets my Italian 
Blood Orange Shrub apart from the crowd is its use of charred rosemary, which intensifies the 
shrub’s flavor, and blood oranges, a spunky fruit with blood-red flesh and a taste that lies some -
where between sweet and tart. Bound with citrusy yuzu vinegar and Demerara sugar, this shrub 
can be used in cocktails after just 24 hours. Or, if you’ve got the patience, you can age it in the 
fridge or at cellar temperature for a month or two before using it. (Y our friends may try to grab a

Instant shrubs.  It’s true that shrubs—flavorful mixtures of fruit, 
sugar, and vinegar—benefit from time and patience, since the aging 
process helps their flavors concentrate and improve. But what if your 
patience just won’t hold out? No problem! Shrubs can be ready in as little 
as a few minutes, since you don’t necessarily need to concoct your shrub 
before you make your cocktail: you can actually make the shrub right into 
your cocktail. Here’s how: Replace the fruit and sugar with marmalade, 
and balance it out with the vinegar’s acidity—combined, they’ll fool your 
palate into thinking this instant shrub spent weeks aging in the fridge. DIRECTIONS
SIDENOTECombine the marmalade, vinegar, simple syrup, and 
rum or rye whiskey over ice in a Boston shaker. Shake like crazy, and then strain into an coupe glass. Top with the seltzer water and the orange bitters. Done.  
Time: 24 hours.  Combine the oranges, the peels, sugar, and 
the charred rosemary (needles only, no wood, please!). Stir to

(Text)VISIONARIA COCKTAIL  THE CLASSIC ROB ROY COCKTAIL
This boozy twist on the famous Arnold Palmer iced tea-lemonade combo is truly the stuff of 
dreams. It combines graciously exotic jasmine tea (don’t use jasmine green tea, though: that’s dif-
ferent!) with homemade ginger syrup in a tall glass—and it’s the perfect showcase for Tennessee 
sipping whiskey (that is, straight bourbon whiskey produced in the state of Tennessee). Fresh 
lemon juice and a hit of seltzer water give it a refreshing kick—and if you make your ice with 
jasmine tea, too, you can be sure your Visionaria won’t get watered down along the way. Although 
its taste is sophisticated, there’s nothing complicated about this cocktail; it’s as easy to make as its ingredients are to find. The Visionaria is a great match for salty snacks, so it makes a very 
nice aperitif. Alternatively, enjoy it on its own; it’s just the thing to accompany a lazy afternoon 
of daydreaming. My grandfather was very fond of a pre-dinner Rob Roy. For him, there was no better way to 
stimulate the appetite and to relax before a family meal. Well, times change, but the effects of 
good Scotch don’t, and this cocktail is as delicious as it was when it was first created in the 
late nineteenth century in New York City. A kissing cousin of the Manhattan—the Manhattan 
calls for rye whiskey, where the Rob Roy employs Scotch—this drink is named after the eigh-
teenth-century Scottish hero Rob Roy MacGregor, and it’s as noble as its namesake. Here’s the time-honored recipe. It’s exactly how my grandfather enjoyed them back in the day, and it’ll be

(Text)THE CLASP KNIFE COCKTAIL
GINGER-LIME RUM DAIQUIRIBack in the day, a seaman would have used his clasp knife to repair the ship’s rigging and 
cordage—which meant he’d have to climb high up onto the yardarms above the roiling sea. This 
strong, tart cocktail takes its name from that essential tool. And beware: like its namesake, it’s 
got a surprisingly sharp edge. Be sure to make it with Belgian-style “sour” ale, not traditional ale. 
Sour ale is a beer with an acidic taste that’s made by introducing various yeasts into the brewing 
process, unlike “regular” ale, which is brewed in a sterile environment. Its flavor is a great partner 
for my Ginger-Lime Shrubb, and together they balance the potency of Rhum Agricole and 
Pineau des Charentes (a sweet, fortified wine). Landlubbers who indulge in too many of these 
little firecrackers may need to be dosed with Angostura bitters the next morning to make the 
pain go away. So stick with just one, preferably before a hearty meal. 
Have you ever had a real daiquiri? I don’t mean that syrupy, pseudo-fruity red stuff topped with 
rubbishy rum. The classic daiquiri, which has been around since the early twentieth century, 
has nothing to do with the artificially colored variety that comes in bottles or cans. I’m talking 
about the real thing: a trinity of handcrafted white rum, freshly squeezed lime juice, and a little 
simple syrup. If this doesn’t sound familiar already, consider yourself introduced. But instead of 
starting you off with the traditional recipe, I’m going to throw you into the deep end with my 
twisted version of the rum daiquiri. Here, a mere ounce (30 ml) of my Ginger-Lime Shrubb adds 
extra tartness and pep to the rum-lime-sugar combination. The result is a straight-up, ginger-laced cocktail that’s as bracing as a margarita—and as refreshing and reinvigorating on a warm day.    _ 2 OUNCES (60 ML0 PINEAU

(Text)MR. STRAHAN’S SEVERED EAR I BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR?
Named after a fictional seaman who slices off a portion of his own ear, this potent cocktail 
really packs a punch, thanks to un-aged tequila (a great partner for spelt whiskey) and grilled 
grapefruit juice, which lends it a subtle, charred flavor. A distant cousin of the tequila sunrise, Mr. 
Strahan’s Severed Ear makes a most animating aperitif. If you haven’t discovered the pleasures of beer cocktails, brace yourself, because your life is about 
to change: They make fabulous (and fabulously effective) aperitifs. Refreshing and full of joie de 
vivre, the assertive, interrogative, straight-talking I Beg Y our Pardon, Sir? is just what you want 
pre-barbeque on a hot summer’s day.

Rhum Agricole  is a type of handmade white rum that hails from the 
West Indian island of Martinique,  where it was used in lots of traditional 
curatives, since it would’ve acted as a preservative for delicate herbs 
and spices (and might have given the patient a much-needed buzz at the 
end of an interminable—and possibly  expensive—curative session!) But 
what’s with the “h” in “Rhum?” Well, in rum parlay, “Rhum” signifies an 
appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC), or “controlled designation of ori -
gin,” which means that your bottle of Rhum has met certain standards of 
production, and will always be made from freshly cut sugarcane instead 
of the ubiquitous molasses. That said, don’t worry if you can’t find Rhum 
Agricole: use any good quality spiced rum in its place. SIDENOTEAPERITIFS •

Sometimes, a strong drink is exactly what the doctor ordered. If that’s where you’re at, look no 
further than an Old Gnaw. Paired with freshly squeezed lemon juice and a simple syrup made 
with smoky chiles, it showcases hopped whiskey, which adds a beer-flavored spark to just about 
any cocktail. Why? Because, while all whiskeys begin life as “beer” (though you wouldn’t want to 
drink it before it becomes whiskey, that’s for sure), they’re usually made sans hops. (Hops are the 
flowers of the hop plant, and they’re used in beermaking to lend your favorite brew its distinctive 
bitterness and aroma.) Hopped whiskey, on the other hand, is made with hops: Hence the name, 
and the unmistakable beer-like flavor. With its palate-lifting citrus and spice and a pinch of 
tongue-tickling sea salt, the Old Gnaw is the ideal aperitif.

ulating all at once. It’s been treasured as a valuable curative—but it’s 
also been seen as physically and morally toxic: During Prohibition, the 
nationwide American ban on the production and consumption of alcoholic 
beverages that was in place between 1920 and 1933, it was verboten, 
along with all beer, wine, and liquor. But what is whiskey, anyway?
Simply put, whiskey is a distilled beverage that begins life in the same 
way that beer does: as a mixture or “mash” of one or more grains, 
including corn, rye, barley, and wheat. Then it’s aged in wooden, usually 
oak, barrels before it’s bottled and sold. Whiskey normally clocks in at 
around forty percent alcohol by volume (ABV), or eighty proof, and it’s 
made in just about every country in which grain can be grown. Ireland 
and Scotland are its ancestral homes: in fact, the word “whiskey” is 
derived from the Scots-Gaelic phrase uisge beatha, or “water of life.” 
Over hundreds of years, uisge beatha (pronounced ISH-geh BAH-hah) 
eventually evolved into the word whisky (for reasons lost to the mists of 
time, the Scottish dropped the “e” in the word: these days, drinkers in 
Japan, India, and Canada also spell the word sans “e,” while the Irish and 
American spellings still retain it).  
Don’t ask. Just drink it.SIDENOTEAPERITIFS  •

(Text)THE CLASSIC WHISKEY SOUR
SHERRY PEPPER INFUSIONAccording to legend, while the author Ernest Hemingway was living in France, he used whiskey 
sours as a substitute for medicine. He was a man who—to use a gross understatement—knew 
his liquor, and I tend to agree with him. Well, on this point, at least. Anyway, I’ve made whiskey 
sours for years now, and I used to love them with bourbon—but then I discovered that it makes 
much more sense to use rye in this classic drink. That’s because rye whiskey’s natural spiciness 
makes for a drier cocktail. For an alternative take on the whiskey sour, try adding a few drops of 
bright-red Peychaud’s bitters as a final touch; they look gorgeous when dashed over the drink’s 
snow-white foam, and they lend depth and balance to this sweet-and-sour libation. It’s what 
cocktail hour was made for.
On the island of Bermuda, a British protectorate that boasts a long history of shrub-making, 
residents preserve hot chili peppers with sherry and aromatic bitters for a table-to-glass condiment 
that’s intensely hot and powerful. My Sherry Pepper Infusion is delicious in cool, savory cocktails 
like Bloody Marys (especially as a prelude to brunch), and it adds a piquant flourish to cooked fish 
dishes when served tableside. You can make this with a darker, older variety of sherry with a more 
robust mouthfeel, like oloroso or Pedro Ximénez, but it’ll take several months (or even up to a 
year) to mature—whereas this version, made with crisp, aromatic, refreshing fino sherry, takes only a 
month. Word to the wise: Wear gloves when you chop insanely hot bird’s eye chilies. Otherwise, their 
essential oils will cling to your skin, even after you wash your hands.  _ 1 PIECE THICKLY SLICED

Rub the inside of a cocktail shaker with the lemon zest, and then 
add the egg white. Dry shake—that is, shake without adding 
ice—for about 10 seconds to create the meringue-like foam that’s 
essential to a whiskey sour. Then fill the shaker three-quarters 
full with ice. Add the simple syrup, rye whiskey, and lemon 
juice. Shake for another 10 seconds or so. Strain the mixture 
into an old-fashioned glass, and garnish with the lemon chunk 
and an Easy Home-Cured Cocktail Cherry. Magnificent.

(Text)THE ROBERT BURNS COCKTAIL
Scotch whisky is an essential ingredient in the Robert Burns cocktail, a tipple that honors Scotland’s 
most famous poet. (Some drinkers think that this classic cocktail was named after a cigar salesman 
of the same name, but I prefer the literary association. So there!) Every sip of the Robbie Burns 
is pure elegance, whether it’s served straight up in a martini glass with a flamed orange zest twist, 
or over a crystal-clear chunk of hand-cut ice. That said, if you’re a “wee tim’rous beastie,” as Burns 
himself wrote, steer clear: This cocktail is not for the faint of heart. If you can handle it, though, it’s 
a truly luxurious way to start an evening. Try it as an aperitif with a sweet-and-smoky hors d’oeuvre, 
like bacon-wrapped dates.

Scotch whisky is an essential ingredient in the Robert Burns cocktail, a tipple that honors Scotland’s 
most famous poet. (Some drinkers think that this classic cocktail was named after a cigar salesman 
of the same name, but I prefer the literary association. So there!) Every sip of the Robbie Burns 
is pure elegance, whether it’s served straight up in a martini glass with a flamed orange zest twist, 
or over a crystal-clear chunk of hand-cut ice. That said, if you’re a “wee tim’rous beastie,” as Burns 
himself wrote, steer clear: This cocktail is not for the faint of heart. If you can handle it, though, it’s 
a truly luxurious way to start an evening. Try it as an aperitif with a sweet-and-smoky hors d’oeuvre, 
like bacon-wrapped dates.

(Text)A TWISTED NEGRONI
The Negroni has been on my mind for years. Maybe that’s because it’s one of the first cocktails I ever 
tried—and I drank it in Rome, at the top of the famous Spanish Steps. There, in the Italian sunshine, 
impossibly well-dressed people were sipping short, bright-red cocktails: I quickly followed suit. 
And it didn’t take long for me to become bewitched by the vivid Negroni. Like the bitter Italian 
soda I just couldn’t get enough of, a Negroni tastes sharp and acerbic, and it’s a classic aperitif, 
guaranteed to lift your palate and sharpen your appetite before a great meal. My version maintains 
the traditional 1:1:1 ratio of Campari, vermouth, and gin—but it benefits from the last-minute 
addition of dark, brooding chocolate bitters. Incredibly civilized.

Fill a cocktail mixing glass three-quarters full with

(Text)SHALL WE TALK OF BUSINESS, MADAM? OLD SHIPS OF BATTLE 
The Madam in question is Mrs. McRankine, a venerable Scottish widow with a formidable 
amount of spice in her language in Robert Louis Stevenson’s unfinished novel, St. Ives. Like Mrs. 
McRankine herself, this cocktail certainly speaks its mind. If you like classic whisky sours, you’ll 
love this spiced-up kissing cousin of the classic drink.Is the classic Rob Roy one of your true loves? If so, now drink this. Old Ships of Battle is my 
Cocktail Whisperer’s twisted take on the Scottish legend. It replaces the sweet vermouth with 
the old-fashioned cherry liqueur known as Cherry Heering. (First produced in the early nine-
teenth century, Cherry Heering is a spiced, cherry-based liqueur that isn’t terribly sweet, and it’s 
also used in drinks like the Singapore Sling. On the off chance you can’t find it, try cherry brandy 
instead.) Then it calls for a whack of dry vermouth. Instead of plain old Angostura bitters, it 
kicks things up with a dash or three of strangely beguiling lemon bitters for a citrusy, aromatic 
finish. In a shout-out to the great British age of sail, I’ve named this drink Old Ships of Battle, 
and I think it’s best enjoyed before lunch on a blustery spring day. _ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) SCOTCH WHISKY

Fill a Boston shaker three-quarters full with ice. Add the

lemon juice, and then cap and shake vigorously for 10 seconds.
Strain the mixture into a rocks glass over a single cube of 
hand-cut ice. Drip the bitters over the top, and serve.
Food-friendly cocktails.  Great aperitifs like the Shall We Talk Of Business, Madam? can happily be 
enjoyed on their own, but they make wonderful accompaniments to pre-dinner nibbles,  too, since they’re 
usually short drinks with brightly-acidic or bitter flavor profiles that rouse the appetite and slice right through 
savory, salty, or oily antipasti. Hungry yet? Serve just about any  aperitif alongside these simple snacks:
°  Handfuls of sea-salted, roasted almonds
°  Thin slices of prosciutto, or Serrano or Parma ham
°  Sweet Medjool dates stuffed with bleu cheese°  Salty nicoise olives
° Spiced, oven-roasted Brussels sproutsSIDENOTE

the old-fashioned cherry liqueur known as Cherry Heering. (First produced in the early nine-
teenth century, Cherry Heering is a spiced, cherry-based liqueur that isn’t terribly sweet, and it’s 
also used in drinks like the Singapore Sling. On the off chance you can’t find it, try cherry brandy 
instead.) Then it calls for a whack of dry vermouth. Instead of plain old Angostura bitters, it 
kicks things up with a dash or three of strangely beguiling lemon bitters for a citrusy, aromatic 
finish. In a shout-out to the great British age of sail, I’ve named this drink Old Ships of Battle, 
and I think it’s best enjoyed before lunch on a blustery spring day. _ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) SCOTCH WHISKY

INGREDIENTSDIRECTIONS
Fill a Boston shaker three-quarters full with ice. Add the 
whisky, the Sherry Pepper Infusion, the simple syrup, and the 
lemon juice, and then cap and shake vigorously for 10 seconds.
Strain the mixture into a rocks glass over a single cube of 
hand-cut ice. Drip the bitters over the top, and serve.
Food-friendly cocktails.  Great aperitifs like the Shall We Talk Of Business, Madam? can happily be 
enjoyed on their own, but they make wonderful accompaniments to pre-dinner nibbles,  too, since they’re 
usually short drinks with brightly-acidic or bitter flavor profiles that rouse the appetite and slice right through 
savory, salty, or oily antipasti. Hungry yet? Serve just about any  aperitif alongside these simple snacks:
°  Handfuls of sea-salted, roasted almonds
°  Thin slices of prosciutto, or Serrano or Parma ham
°  Sweet Medjool dates stuffed with bleu cheese°  Salty nicoise olives
° Spiced, oven-roasted Brussels sproutsSIDENOTE

The Madam in question is Mrs. McRankine, a venerable Scottish widow with a formidable 
amount of spice in her language in Robert Louis Stevenson’s unfinished novel, St. Ives. Like Mrs. 
McRankine herself, this cocktail certainly speaks its mind. If you like classic whisky sours, you’ll 
love this spiced-up kissing cousin of the classic drink.Is the classic Rob Roy one of your true loves? If so, now drink this. Old Ships of Battle is my

(Text)BEFORE THE ADVENT OF MODERN MEDICINE, HOW DID ORDINARY PEOPLE—WITH MINIMAL ACCESS  
TO QUALIFIED DOCTORS—HEAL WHAT AILED THEM? THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE: THEY TURNED TO  
THEIR LOCAL PHARMACIST, OR APOTHECARY, WHO COULD ADMINISTER HEALING POTIONS TO THEIR  
PATIENTS (USUALLY IN VERY SMALL, CAREFULLY-MEASURED AMOUNTS). APOTHECARIES MANUFAC -
TURED TINCTURES, BITTERS, ELIXIRS, AND TONICS FOR ALL KINDS OF AILMENTS; USING PRIMITIVE  
INGREDIENTS, SOME OF THESE RECIPES WERE OLD AS SPOKEN HISTORY. IN MANY CASES, THESE  
CURATIVE, HOMEMADE POTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN LACED WITH COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF DISTILLED  
ALCOHOL, THEN STIRRED OR SHAKEN BEFORE BEING POURED DIRECTLY INTO A GLASS AND GIVEN  
TO THE PATIENT ON THE SPOT AS A PRESCRIPTIVE. THE EARLIEST KNOWN PHARMACIST-PREPARED  TREATMENTS CALLED FOR FRAGILE HERBS, FLOWERS, FRUITS, AND EVEN VEGETABLES—ALONG WITH  THE AFOREMENTIONED SUBSTANTIAL QUANTITIES OF ALCOHOL, WHICH PREVENTED THEM FROM  
ROTTING, AND PRESERVED THEIR HEALING QUALITIES. MOST OF THESE BOTANICALS WOULD HAVE  BEEN GROWN RIGHT IN THE APOTHECARIES’ OWN KITCHEN GARDENS, TO ENSURE FRESHNESS AND  POTENCY. EACH FORMULARY WOULD HAVE BEEN CUSTOM-MADE, DEPENDING ON THE INDIVIDUAL  PATIENT’S COMPLAINT, AND WAS HAND-PREPARED FROM START TO FINISH.A successful pharmacist had to earn his customers’ trust, and that meant delivering curatives 
that would actually work. Many of the most effective curatives in the United States were 
introduced by immigrants from Europe, Asia, and the Caribbean islands, who brought 
some of their healing methods (and their exotic ingredients) with them. Folk treatments using 
herbs suspended in alcohol had been commonplace in all of these locations for hundreds of years, so 
the methods these immigrant healers practiced would have dated back centuries—if not millennia. 
And that includes alcoholic bitters—highly concentrated herbal concoctions that were prescribed 
to treat a multitude of afflictions, like malaises of the stomach and respiratory systems. Like their 
European counterparts, American pharmacists came to view them as reliable curatives—especially in 
the absence of modern pharmaceutical companies that could produce and distribute synthetic drugs. 
 Folks didn’t just consult their local pharmacist for physical complaints, either. Before the advent 
of powerful, synthetic antidepressants in the mid-twentieth century, sufferers would have turned 
to herbal cures for relief from stormy moods. And pharmacists had a variety of remedies at their 
disposal. Teas made from valerian root or chamomile could relieve anxiety and irritation, and could 
help the patient fall into a restorative sleep that would ease peevishness. The natural oils in sage can 
promote a sense of calm and content, which could have taken the nervous edge off the stressed and 
the restless. And of course, alcohol was recommended as an antidote to glum moods, and as a way 
to restore flagging energy. Rest assured that very few of the apothecary’s patients would’ve resisted 
a healing dose of sherry or brandy to “calm the nerves!” Using alcohol would’ve helped preserve the 
healing power of the pharmacist’s botanicals, too. It truly was essential for medicinal purposes.  
 These days, we know to avoid overconsumption of alcohol, and we turn to qualified doctors or 
other medical professionals for health advice. But the spirit (no pun intended!) of these traditional 
curatives lives on in the cocktails in this chapter. Digestive woes troubling you? Make yourself a 
small-but-powerful Sazerac, which features Peychaud’s bitters and absinthe—both of which were said to be great for uneasy tummies. Or, mix up a batch of Dr. Arrow’s Strong Water Shrub; it’s 
packed with nutritious beets, Asian spices, and vinegar, which promotes digestive health. If you’ve got 
a stubborn cold, treat yourself to a Hot Buttered Rum to ease those aches and pains. And if it’s your 
mood that needs tweaking, try a Mead Refresher: it’s a sparkling combination of mead (wine made 
from fermented honey), plus lemonade and fizzy water, and it’s nothing short of good cheer in a glass.

(Text)FERNET BRANCA WITH ENGLISH BREAKFAST TEA AND RAW HONEY 
DR. ARROW’S STRONG WATER SHRUBFernet Branca was invented in nineteenth-century Italy to ease maladies of the belly. Fernet is 
certainly easy to quaff on its own or mixed with cola—but it’s just as good served steaming hot. 
In the Caribbean, it’s often paired with English breakfast tea and honey, a combination that’s 
said to relieve stomachaches of all sorts (including those caused by spending too much time 
in the sun sipping cocktails, perhaps?) Nota bene: While it calls for English breakfast tea, the 
Cocktail Whisperer doesn’t recommend trying this curative for breakfast. You’ve been warned.
Dr. Arrow’s Strong Water Shrub transforms lemons, spices, pickled beets, sugar, and vinegar into 
a syrup that’s fragrant, intense, and intoxicating. It’s a fabulous match for clear spirits like vodka 
or gin. Remember, vinegar is great for the digestive system, so this savory shrub will have you 
healthy as a handsome goat in no time. _ 3 OUNCES (90 ML) FERNET BRANCA

DIRECTIONSPreheat two mugs by filling them with boiling water; discard the 
water after a few seconds. Add 11/2 ounces (45 ml) of Fernet 
Branca to each mug. Fill the mugs with tea, and stir a tablespoon 
(20 g) of honey into each mug. Lean back, sip slowly, and let the 
healing begin. Serves 2.

nonreactive bowl with their peels. Add the sugar, the assorted spices, and 
the cooked, peeled beets. Stir well to cover the beets and lemons with the 
sugar. Cover tightly and let sit at room temperature for 24 hours. Mash 
as much pulp as you can from the lemons and beets, and then strain the 
liquid from the mixture. Add the vinegar to the liquid, and let sit tightly 
covered either in the fridge or in a cool, dark place for 2–3 weeks. Funnel 
your shrub to sterilized bottles, and be sure to shake them every 1–2 days.

DR. ARROW’S STRONG WATER SHRUBFernet Branca was invented in nineteenth-century Italy to ease maladies of the belly. Fernet is 
certainly easy to quaff on its own or mixed with cola—but it’s just as good served steaming hot. 
In the Caribbean, it’s often paired with English breakfast tea and honey, a combination that’s 
said to relieve stomachaches of all sorts (including those caused by spending too much time 
in the sun sipping cocktails, perhaps?) Nota bene: While it calls for English breakfast tea, the 
Cocktail Whisperer doesn’t recommend trying this curative for breakfast. You’ve been warned.
Dr. Arrow’s Strong Water Shrub transforms lemons, spices, pickled beets, sugar, and vinegar into 
a syrup that’s fragrant, intense, and intoxicating. It’s a fabulous match for clear spirits like vodka 
or gin. Remember, vinegar is great for the digestive system, so this savory shrub will have you 
healthy as a handsome goat in no time. Preheat two mugs by filling them with boiling water; discard the

(Text)ULYSSES LEFT ON ITHACA COCKTAIL
Smoked American whiskey is a wonderful match for a citrus-oil-tinged tea like Earl Grey. Don’t 
worry, I’m not suggesting you start spiking your morning pick-me-up; this delicate cocktail proves 
that Earl Grey isn’t just for breakfast anymore. Bound together by homemade ginger simple syrup 
(don’t forget that ginger is a well-known curative for nausea), the Ulysses is named for the Greek 
hero of the epic poem, The Odyssey. Reluctant to leave his homeland of Ithaca, he pretended to be 
insane by sowing his fields with salt instead of grain. In his honor, the final touch to the Ulysses is a 
pinch of sea salt, which adds an unexpected, crunchy kick. It’s a delicious finish. The ingredients for 
this cocktail are simplicity themselves, but the sum of the parts is truly bewitching. 
_ 4 OUNCES (120 ML) FRESHLY-BREWED  
EARL GREY TEA, COOLED
_ 3 OUNCES (90 ML) SMOKED  
AMERICAN WHISKEY
_ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) SPICY GINGER  
SIMPLE SYRUP (SEE PAGE 313)  
_ 1 OUNCE (30 ML) CLUB SODA
_ 2 PINCHES OF SEA SALT_ 2 SPRIGS OF THYMEINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Brew and cool the Earl Grey Tea. Fill a mixing glass three-quarters 
full with ice. Pour the whiskey, tea, and the Spicy Ginger Simple 
Syrup over the ice, and then stir to combine. Taste for sweetness: If 
it’s not sweet enough, add a bit more simple syrup. Place a chunk of 
hand-cut ice into each of two short rocks glasses. (If you really want 
to bring out the gingery taste of the simple syrup, make ginger ice 
in advance: Freeze slices of fresh ginger root into your homemade 
ice.) Add the splash of club soda to each glass, and top each with 
a pinch of sea salt to add a welcome “crunch” to each sip. Garnish 
with the thyme sprigs—and get ready to pour a second round.

(Text)SAZERAC COCKTAIL
Created in New Orleans early in the twentieth century, the Sazerac Cocktail still occupies a 
well-deserved spot in our cabinet of healing cocktails. It calls for Peychaud’s bitters, which were 
originally intended to heal stomach sicknesses, as well as the infamous liqueur, absinthe—also 
known as the Green Fairy or La Fée Verte, due to its bright-green hue. Back in the day, the 
wormwood in absinthe would have placed this cocktail as a curative, since it was reputed to 
be both an antispasmodic and a digestive aid. (Licorice-scented anisette is a good replacement 
for absinthe if you can’t find it.) This version of the Sazerac calls for rye whiskey instead of 
traditional cognac, and it’s a powerfully sweet, strikingly colorful, deliciously healing concoction.  
_ 1 OUNCE (25 ML) ABSINTHE  
(OR ANISETTE)  
_ 21/2 OUNCES (75 ML) RYE WHISKEY    
_ 4 TABLESPOONS (60 ML) SIMPLE  
SYRUP (SEE PAGE 311)
_ ICE CUBES
_ SEVERAL DASHES OF  
PEYCHAUD’S BITTERS
_ 2 LEMON TWISTSINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Wash two rocks glasses with the absinthe by pouring 1/2 ounce (15 
ml) absinthe into each glass, swirling it around, and pouring it 
out—preferably into your mouth! Divide the rye whiskey between 
the two glasses. Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of simple syrup to each 
glass. Pop 1 large ice cube into each cocktail, and top each with a 
dash or two of bitters. Garnish the drinks with lemon twists. Lift 
your glasses high, and drink to happier bellies. Serves 2.

chlorophyll levels of the botanicals originally used in its production—
and because the psychoactive substances that were also present in 
them could allegedly make heavy drinkers hallucinate—absinthe used 
to contain the leaves and blossoms of the wormwood plant, Artemisia 
absinthium. It’s been used in traditional medicine since ancient times 
to ease headaches and general malaise, and to soothe stomachs made 
ornery from exposure to spoiled food.
And it inspired—and, in some cases, ruined—dozens of nineteenth- and 
early twentieth-century artists and writers. Absinthe, or la feé verte, was 
popular among people of all social classes in nineteenth-century France, 
and it became more popular still once it was mass-produced around the 
turn of the twentieth century. Its reputed health dangers (plus, perhaps, 
its bohemian associations?) caused many countries to ban it, but today, it’s regarded as neither more nor less dangerous than any other type 
of spirit. (Of course, it’s important to enjoy spirits of all types sensibly. 
Just sayin’!) Famous devotees of absinthe included Oscar Wilde, Charles

(Text)SAZERAC COCKTAIL
Created in New Orleans early in the twentieth century, the Sazerac Cocktail still occupies a 
well-deserved spot in our cabinet of healing cocktails. It calls for Peychaud’s bitters, which were 
originally intended to heal stomach sicknesses, as well as the infamous liqueur, absinthe—also 
known as the Green Fairy or La Fée Verte, due to its bright-green hue. Back in the day, the 
wormwood in absinthe would have placed this cocktail as a curative, since it was reputed to 
be both an antispasmodic and a digestive aid. (Licorice-scented anisette is a good replacement 
for absinthe if you can’t find it.) This version of the Sazerac calls for rye whiskey instead of 
traditional cognac, and it’s a powerfully sweet, strikingly colorful, deliciously healing concoction.  
_ 1 OUNCE (25 ML) ABSINTHE  
(OR ANISETTE)  
_ 21/2 OUNCES (75 ML) RYE WHISKEY    
_ 4 TABLESPOONS (60 ML) SIMPLE  
SYRUP (SEE PAGE 311)
_ ICE CUBES
_ SEVERAL DASHES OF  
PEYCHAUD’S BITTERS
_ 2 LEMON TWISTSINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Wash two rocks glasses with the absinthe by pouring 1/2 ounce (15 
ml) absinthe into each glass, swirling it around, and pouring it 
out—preferably into your mouth! Divide the rye whiskey between 
the two glasses. Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of simple syrup to each 
glass. Pop 1 large ice cube into each cocktail, and top each with a 
dash or two of bitters. Garnish the drinks with lemon twists. Lift 
your glasses high, and drink to happier bellies. Serves 2.

chlorophyll levels of the botanicals originally used in its production—
and because the psychoactive substances that were also present in 
them could allegedly make heavy drinkers hallucinate—absinthe used 
to contain the leaves and blossoms of the wormwood plant, Artemisia 
absinthium. It’s been used in traditional medicine since ancient times 
to ease headaches and general malaise, and to soothe stomachs made 
ornery from exposure to spoiled food.
And it inspired—and, in some cases, ruined—dozens of nineteenth- and 
early twentieth-century artists and writers. Absinthe, or la feé verte, was 
popular among people of all social classes in nineteenth-century France, 
and it became more popular still once it was mass-produced around the 
turn of the twentieth century. Its reputed health dangers (plus, perhaps, 
its bohemian associations?) caused many countries to ban it, but today, it’s regarded as neither more nor less dangerous than any other type 
of spirit. (Of course, it’s important to enjoy spirits of all types sensibly. 
Just sayin’!) Famous devotees of absinthe included Oscar Wilde, Charles 
Rimbaud, Vincent van Gogh, Ernest Dowson, and Ernest Hemingway.SIDENOTECRAFT CURATIVES •

(Text)CHARTREUSE ELIXIR APPLICATION DR. ARROW’S STRONG WATER ELIXIR
The legendary Chartreuse Vegetal Elixir is not imported into the United States—and perhaps 
for good reason, since its alcohol content approaches a blistering 140 proof. (Feel free to sub-
stitute regular chartreuse for this recipe instead.) Chartreuse contains over 130 different herbs, 
but the recipe is guarded as if it were the Holy Grail: Produced in the French Alps by the Péres 
Chartreux monks, the mystical powers of the ingredients are guarded so closely that only three 
monks at a time are trusted with the original recipe for the Chartreuse Vegetal Elixir. Although 
the monks only produce a small amount of the liqueur today, Chartreuse Vegetal Elixir is sold 
in the same liquid form today as it was originally distilled, and is best served straight from a 
teaspoon or dripped onto a sugar cube to balance its bitter flavor. The Péres Chartreux monks 
believe that the key to their long life is facilitated through the careful—and regular—application 
of these potent herbal ingredients. Wondering what to do with that batch of Dr. Arrow’s that’s been aging happily in your fridge? 
Start with a savory Strong Water Elixir. It makes an excellent aperitif, especially in the winter, 
when your palate needs a lift before tackling comfort foods like short ribs, garlic smashed pota-
toes, and root vegetables: Fresh dill, a twinkling of fleur de sel, and a lemon zest twist keep things 
light and fresh.

Beet benefits.  If you’re looking for a reason to mix up a couple 
rounds of Dr. Arrow’s Strong Water Elixir, chew on this: Beets are nutritional 
powerhouses, full of compounds that may prevent liver and cardiovascular 
disease—and that, as the saying goes, can’t do any harm and may do some 
good. Plus, they’re staggering sources of vitamins and minerals, like folate 
and manganese. (And when you’re making the Strong Water Shrub, don’t 
throw out the beet greens. Boil or sauté them, as you would with spinach: 
They’re packed with valuable dietary fiber, calcium, and magnesium.) SIDENOTEDIRECTIONS
Add the vodka and the shrub to a cocktail mixing glass. Mix gently 
and use a Hawthorne strainer to divide the mixture between two coupe 
glasses. Top each glass with 1 ounce (30 ml) of seltzer, and 2–3 shakes 
of lemon bitters. Garnish each glass with a lemon zest and a sprig of 
fresh dill. Finish each drink with a pinch of fleur de sel. Serves 2.

(Text)RYE WHISKEY SLUSHEE WITH ROASTED STRAWBERRIES
Strawberry and rhubarb is a combination that just smacks of summer. But there’s no need to wait 
for those long July evenings to indulge in one of these slushy, R-rated cocktails: This icy drink 
is refreshing—and bewitching—just about any time of year, and it’s a great way to begin a meal, 
too. Here, organic rhubarb tea liqueur, simultaneously tart and sweet, acts as a tasty counterpoint 
to caramelized strawberries, and rye whiskey is the boozy glue that binds them together. Like 
rye whiskey itself, rhubarb has a history that’s as old as the United States, and then some: In the 
eighteenth century, American pharmacists would have recommended it as a digestive aid (as Asian 
herbal healers had been doing for thousands of years). Plus, rhubarb packs a hefty wallop of vitamin 
C, which boosts the immune system. So don’t wait: Mix up a Rye Whiskey Slushee for a tantalizing 
taste of days gone by.

(Text)RYE WHISKEY SLUSHEE WITH ROASTED STRAWBERRIES
Strawberry and rhubarb is a combination that just smacks of summer. But there’s no need to wait 
for those long July evenings to indulge in one of these slushy, R-rated cocktails: This icy drink 
is refreshing—and bewitching—just about any time of year, and it’s a great way to begin a meal, 
too. Here, organic rhubarb tea liqueur, simultaneously tart and sweet, acts as a tasty counterpoint 
to caramelized strawberries, and rye whiskey is the boozy glue that binds them together. Like 
rye whiskey itself, rhubarb has a history that’s as old as the United States, and then some: In the 
eighteenth century, American pharmacists would have recommended it as a digestive aid (as Asian 
herbal healers had been doing for thousands of years). Plus, rhubarb packs a hefty wallop of vitamin 
C, which boosts the immune system. So don’t wait: Mix up a Rye Whiskey Slushee for a tantalizing 
taste of days gone by.

(Text)MINT JULEP CURIOSITY MOCK MINT JULEP
This Mint Julep Curiosity is a quirky take on the classic M.J. Sure, it includes fresh mint, rye 
whiskey, and simple syrup—but it’s also spiked with root tea liqueur, an instant orange shrub, 
bittersweet chocolate syrup (it works, trust me!) and mint bitters. I’m sure my Southern friends 
rue the day that chocolate bitters made their way into a mint julep, but—unless you’re a staunch 
purist—fear not: this curative Curiosity is intriguing, refreshing, and delicious.  Did you know that a great mint julep doesn’t need to be heavy on the booze? In fact, it doesn’t 
really need booze at all. Say hello to my Mock Mint Julep, one of the most exciting mocktails 
I’ve ever met. I’ve added an aromatic and addictive twist in the form of my Dr. Arrow’s Strong

Place the mint in your grandpappy's sterling silver julep cup. 
Muddle the mint with 2 drops of the mint bitters, the Basic Simple 
Syrup, and a bit of the crushed ice. Then add the rye whiskey, the 
root tea liqueur, the chocolate syrup, and the orange shrub. Add 
more ice (and a little more rye, if you like) and mix until the julep 
cup is nicely frosted, inside and out. Finish with 2 more drops 
of the mint bitters, and then serve. Kentucky Derby optional. 
Rejuvenating juleps. When I say “julep,” what’s the first thing that 
pops into your mind? I bet it’s “mint.” And with good reason, too: the all-Amer -
ican mint julep has quite a pedigree, and dates back at least to the eighteenth 
century. But juleps didn’t always involve mint: In fact, the term “julep” (which 
stems from the Arabic word for “rosewater”) referred to a curative mixture of 
water, sugar, and spirits that could be used as a vehicle for medicines, or for 
steeping herbs in. The moral of the story? A spoonful of sugar—and one of 
liquor—really does help the medicine go down!SIDENOTE

(Text)COCKTAIL WHISPERER’S VERY TWISTED OAT WHISKEY MINT JULEP
Three mint julep recipes in row? Y ou must think I’m joking. Not at all: Each version is unique, and 
each really deserves its spot in the limelight. Over the years, I’ve experimented with mint juleps of 
all sorts, and I love the dry, peppery finish that oat whiskey lends to this drink—not to mention the 
absinthe wash, which brings this time-honored cocktail into another dimension. 
_ 3 OUNCES (90 ML) OAT WHISKEY  
_ 1 TEASPOON (5 G) RAW BROWN  
SUGAR (OR DEMERARA SUGAR)   
_ 1/2 OUNCE (15 ML) ABSINTHE  _ CRUSHED ICE_ FRESH MINT  _ AROMATIC BITTERS OF YOUR CHOICEINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Wash your favorite julep cup by filling it with a mixture of cold 
water, ice, and absinthe, and then pour it out. Add a few table-
spoons of crushed ice to the cup, a few sprigs of mint, and lightly 
crush the mint into the ice to release its oils and perfume. Then, add 
half the whiskey and half the sugar. Mix gently and thoughtfully: 
You’re connecting with the mint julep’s venerable tradition, so take 
care while you’re doing it. Add the rest of the whiskey, then a bit 
more crushed ice, followed by the rest of the sugar: Mix carefully 
with a non-metallic stirrer until the outside of the julep cup is 
frosted over. Step back and admire your work, and then finish 
with a shake or two of aromatic bitters for an extra-savory finish.
Freshly minted cocktails. Handmade cocktails like mint juleps 
truly need fresh mint in order to shine. (Do not use dried mint or bad things 
will happen: marching armies, horses, cannon fire … don’t go there! Mint 
bitters are acceptable in a pinch, however.) If you aren’t growing mint in your 
garden, or in a pot by the windowsill, you should start—you can easily grow 
mint indoors, even in winter. Place your mint plant in a location where it’ll get 
morning sun and partial afternoon shade, and keep the soil moist but not too 
wet. Or, at the very least, keep a package of fresh mint in your fridge in case 
the craving for a Twisted Oat Mint Julep strikes! SIDENOTE

wet. Or, at the very least, keep a package of fresh mint in your fridge in case 
the craving for a Twisted Oat Mint Julep strikes!

(Text)COCKTAIL WHISPERER’S VERY TWISTED OAT WHISKEY MINT JULEP
Three mint julep recipes in row? Y ou must think I’m joking. Not at all: Each version is unique, and 
each really deserves its spot in the limelight. Over the years, I’ve experimented with mint juleps of 
all sorts, and I love the dry, peppery finish that oat whiskey lends to this drink—not to mention the 
absinthe wash, which brings this time-honored cocktail into another dimension. 
_ 3 OUNCES (90 ML) OAT WHISKEY  
_ 1 TEASPOON (5 G) RAW BROWN  
SUGAR (OR DEMERARA SUGAR)   
_ 1/2 OUNCE (15 ML) ABSINTHE  _ CRUSHED ICE_ FRESH MINT  _ AROMATIC BITTERS OF YOUR CHOICEINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Wash your favorite julep cup by filling it with a mixture of cold 
water, ice, and absinthe, and then pour it out. Add a few table-
spoons of crushed ice to the cup, a few sprigs of mint, and lightly 
crush the mint into the ice to release its oils and perfume. Then, add 
half the whiskey and half the sugar. Mix gently and thoughtfully: 
You’re connecting with the mint julep’s venerable tradition, so take 
care while you’re doing it. Add the rest of the whiskey, then a bit 
more crushed ice, followed by the rest of the sugar: Mix carefully 
with a non-metallic stirrer until the outside of the julep cup is 
frosted over. Step back and admire your work, and then finish 
with a shake or two of aromatic bitters for an extra-savory finish.
Freshly minted cocktails. Handmade cocktails like mint juleps 
truly need fresh mint in order to shine. (Do not use dried mint or bad things 
will happen: marching armies, horses, cannon fire … don’t go there! Mint 
bitters are acceptable in a pinch, however.) If you aren’t growing mint in your 
garden, or in a pot by the windowsill, you should start—you can easily grow 
mint indoors, even in winter. Place your mint plant in a location where it’ll get 
morning sun and partial afternoon shade, and keep the soil moist but not too 
wet. Or, at the very least, keep a package of fresh mint in your fridge in case 
the craving for a Twisted Oat Mint Julep strikes! SIDENOTE

(Text)GERMAN PAVILION COCKTAIL
Smoked whiskey has an assertive flavor and aroma, like the German rauch, or smoked, beers that 
I enjoyed as a college student. But herbal, citrusy, Campari-like Sanbitter, an Italian soda with a 
bright-red hue, is more than a match for it—as is the dash of mezcal that rounds out this minimal-
ist-but-mesmerizing drink. (Look for Sanbitter in specialty food shops.) 
_ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) SMOKED  
AMERICAN WHISKEY
_ 1 BOTTLE OF SANBITTER SODA  
(4 OUNCES, OR 120 ML)  
_ 1/4 OUNCE (7 ML) MEZCAL
_ 1 THINLY SLICED LEMON  
WHEEL, HALVEDINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
W ash a Collins glass with the mezcal, and then pour the mezcal out 
(into your mouth, perhaps?) Add the smoked whiskey to the washed 
glass, and top with a chilled bottle of Sanbitter, and garnish 
with a very thin half-round of lemon. It’s supernaturally good. 
What’s smoked whiskey? Don’t try to stick a lit match into your 
whiskey bottle: Smoked whiskey is distilled from grains that have been 
pre-smoked, sometimes using a combination of fuels such as wood and 
peat. Like the strikingly smoky suds for which the German Pavilion cocktail 
is named, some alternative-grain whiskeys have such emphatic flavors 
that enjoying them takes some practice, but don’t give up right away. Try 
a couple different cocktails featuring smoked whiskey—or try tempering it 
with a little plain water or tonic water. SIDENOTE

(Text)NECTARINE, CELERY, AND BLACK PEPPER SHRUB CAPTAIN JOHN SILVER’S CELERY-NECTARINE FIZZ
Does the idea of a celery-flavored drink make you wince? Keep calm: It’s good for you. Celery 
seed has been used as a pain reliever for thousands of years, and may even help lower blood pres-
sure. Plus, celery-flavored soft drinks have been on the market since the late nineteenth century, so a precedent has definitely been set for this delicious shrub. (That said, celery allergies are no 
joke, and can be potentially life threatening, so if you happen to have a celery allergy or sensitivity, 
skip this one.) Nectarine and celery juices are brightened with fresh lime juice and sweetened 
with simple syrup, then combined with a dose of white balsamic: And in two weeks, you’ll have a 
bracing tonic that’s also highly refreshing when used—judiciously—in all sorts of cocktails. In Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island, Captain Silver’s men were about to attack and loot 
a mercantile ship when Silver called to them, “I’m only interested in the wine and the pickles.” I 
couldn’t agree more: Who needs hordes of gold and silver bullion when you’ve got wine and pickles? 
There’s no wine involved in this Celery-Nectarine Fizz, but there sure are pickles—plus 100-proof 
hand-crafted white rum, yellow chartreuse and lemon bitters. Finishing touches of fleur de sel and 
seltzer water make for a memorable cocktail that’s sure to revive tired palates. 
_ 1 POUND (455 G) NECTARINES,  
PEELED, STONES REMOVED
_ 1/2 CUP (120 ML) FRESHLY  
PRESSED CELERY JUICE
_ 1 CUP (200 G) DEMERARA SUGAR
_ 3 OUNCES (90 ML)  
YELLOW CHARTREUSE
_ 1/2 TEASPOON BLACK  
PEPPERCORNS
_ 4 LIMES, PEELED AND QUARTERED  
(BE SURE TO REMOVE ALL  
THE BITTER WHITE PITH)  
_ PINCH OF FLEUR DE SEL
_ 1/2 CUP (120 ML) WHITE  
BALSAMIC VINEGAR  
_ 1/2 CUP (120 ML) WHITE  
WINE VINEGAR  _ 1/2 OUNCE (15 ML) YELLOW  
CHARTREUSE  
_ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) 100-PROOF  
RHUM AGRICOLE BLANC (OR ANY  
GOOD 100-PROOF WHITE RUM)  
_ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) NECTARINE,  
CELERY, AND BLACK PEPPER  
SHRUB (SEE PAGE 58)
_ 1 OUNCE (30 ML) SELTZER WATER
_ PINCH OF FLEUR DE SEL
_ 3 DROPS LEMON BITTERS
_ SEVERAL SHARDS OF CAPTAIN  
JOHN SILVER’S QUICK CELERY  
PICKLE (SEE PAGE 311)
_ CRUSHED ICE  INGREDIENTSINGREDIENTS
DIRECTIONS
Time: 2 weeks. Combine the nectarines with the celery juice, 
Demerara sugar, yellow chartreuse, peppercorns, lime quarters, and the 
fleur de sel in a nonreactive bowl. Cover and let sit at room tempera-
ture for 24 hours. Place a strainer over a second nonreactive bowl, and 
transfer the mixture to the strainer, extracting as much liquid from the nectarines as possible by mashing with a wooden spoon. Discard the nectarines and lime segments or cook into a pot roast. (You may 
want to strain the liquid through two pieces of cheesecloth to remove 
all the peppercorns: That’ll prevent them from getting caught in your 
teeth later on.) Add both the vinegars and stir. Let the mixture sit 
for a few hours, and then funnel into sterilized bottles or Mason jars. 
Store in the fridge and shake daily to help the flavors mellow and 
combine. After 2 weeks your shrub will be ready to use. Store in the 
fridge for about 6 months: If it becomes foamy, discard immediately.

garnish with the celery pickle, sip, and lift your glass to the Captain.  CRAFT CURATIVES •

(Text)NECTARINE, CELERY, AND BLACK PEPPER SHRUB CAPTAIN JOHN SILVER’S CELERY-NECTARINE FIZZ
Does the idea of a celery-flavored drink make you wince? Keep calm: It’s good for you. Celery 
seed has been used as a pain reliever for thousands of years, and may even help lower blood pres -
sure. Plus, celery-flavored soft drinks have been on the market since the late nineteenth century, 
so a precedent has definitely been set for this delicious shrub. (That said, celery allergies are no 
joke, and can be potentially life threatening, so if you happen to have a celery allergy or sensitivity, 
skip this one.) Nectarine and celery juices are brightened with fresh lime juice and sweetened 
with simple syrup, then combined with a dose of white balsamic: And in two weeks, you’ll have a 
bracing tonic that’s also highly refreshing when used—judiciously—in all sorts of cocktails. In Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island, Captain Silver’s men were about to attack and loot 
a mercantile ship when Silver called to them, “I’m only interested in the wine and the pickles.” I 
couldn’t agree more: Who needs hordes of gold and silver bullion when you’ve got wine and pickles? 
There’s no wine involved in this Celery-Nectarine Fizz, but there sure are pickles—plus 100-proof 
hand-crafted white rum, yellow chartreuse and lemon bitters. Finishing touches of fleur de sel and 
seltzer water make for a memorable cocktail that’s sure to revive tired palates.

DIRECTIONS
Time: 2 weeks. Combine the nectarines with the celery juice, 
Demerara sugar, yellow chartreuse, peppercorns, lime quarters, and the 
fleur de sel in a nonreactive bowl. Cover and let sit at room tempera -
ture for 24 hours. Place a strainer over a second nonreactive bowl, and 
transfer the mixture to the strainer, extracting as much liquid from the nectarines as possible by mashing with a wooden spoon. Discard the nectarines and lime segments or cook into a pot roast. (You may 
want to strain the liquid through two pieces of cheesecloth to remove 
all the peppercorns: That’ll prevent them from getting caught in your 
teeth later on.) Add both the vinegars and stir. Let the mixture sit 
for a few hours, and then funnel into sterilized bottles or Mason jars. 
Store in the fridge and shake daily to help the flavors mellow and 
combine. After 2 weeks your shrub will be ready to use. Store in the 
fridge for about 6 months: If it becomes foamy, discard immediately.

(Text)HOT BUTTERED RUM: THE SAILOR’S CURE-ALL
POMPIER COCKTAILShips’ doctors of yesteryear may have delivered doses of this classic hot buttered rum to sailors in 
order to relieve aching bones and flagging spirits. Four magic ingredients—hot tea, sugar, butter, 
and rum—connect every sailor who’s ever had to head face-first into a full gale while out at sea. 
Today, this curative is a treat that goes down smoothly after a long day of skiing, hiking, or just 
sitting by the fire. 
Vermouth served chilled over ice is another famous warm-weather refresher. Vermouth comes 
in two forms: sweet or dry, and each is delicious when served on its own over ice or with the 
addition of other liquors such as rye whiskey or Scotch. Historically, pharmacists may have 
prescribed vermouth as a remedy for afflictions that were exacerbated by hot weather, including 
intestinal disorders and gout. Created by my fellow cocktail scribe, Gary Regan, this cocktail was 
based on the Pompier Highball that’s detailed in the fabulous Gentleman's Companion: An Exotic 
Drinking Book by Charles Baker, Jr., published in 1946.  It features a dash of vitamin-laden citrus, 
and a tot of gin to make the medicine go down, as they say, “with a grin of sin on your face.” It’s 
fairly low in alcohol, so add a bit more gin to it, if you like, but avoid using more than one ounce 
(25 ml), since it’s really the herbs in the vermouth that make this drink a healing treat. _ HOT BLACK TEA
_ 6 OUNCES (175 ML) RUM
_ DARK BROWN SUGAR
_ 2 TEASPOONS BUTTER  
 (ABOUT 2 ACORN-SIZED LUMPS)
_ FRESHLY GRATED NUTMEG
_ 2.5 OUNCES (75 ML) DRY VERMOUTH_ 1/2 OUNCE (15 ML) GIN_ 1/4 OUNCE (7 ML) CRÈME DE CASSIS  _ LEMON TWIST   INGREDIENTS
INGREDIENTSDIRECTIONS
DIRECTIONSPrepare a pot of strong black tea. While the tea is steeping, 
preheat mugs by filling them with boiling water; discard the 
water after a few seconds. Add 3 ounces (90 ml) of rum to each 
mug. Fill each mug with tea and mix gently. Sweeten to taste with dark brown sugar. Add a walnut-sized lump of butter to each mug, and dust each drink with fresh nutmeg. Anchors aweigh! 
Serves 2.
Fill a Boston shaker three-quarters full with ice. Add the 
liquid ingredients one at a time, stir gently, and strain 
into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with the lemon twist. 
Take one each time the temperature hits ninety!

Dot with two drops each of black walnut and plum bitters. 
Serve alongside a sigh of satisfaction.
spices, sugar, and vegetables to tart, homemade lemonade for a healthy, revitalizing quaff. It’s 
an aesthetic treat, too: The beet juice gives the lip-smacking lemonade a bright-red stain. It’s 
darned good, and best of all, it’s packed with vitamins. My version is booze-free, but if you need 
a little hair of the dog, add 2 ounces (60 ml) of good-quality vodka. Serve this faux “shrub” with 
fresh bagels, lox, and cream cheese for brunch. Broil, then squeeze. Fresh citrus juices pop up in lots of cocktails—and with good reason, because 
they’re super-versatile (and because their tart acidity is a good match for all sorts of spirits). You can use them 
to make shrubs; you can add them directly to your drinks; and you can use citrus rinds as judicious garnishes. But have you ever tried broiling your citrus fruit before juicing it? If not, it’s time to start: Broiling the fruit, as in 
“Reading the Paper,” lends it a toasty, caramelized finish. SIDENOTE

(Text)MEAD REFRESHER 
Do your spirits need a bit of a lift? We’ve all been there. Make yourself a Mead Refresher. This 
bubbly cocktail combines sweet mead with tart, refreshing lemonade, a splash of fizzy water, and a 
dash of remedial bitters into a prescriptive that’s sure to cheer and heal at the same time.
_ 6 OUNCES (175 ML) MEAD
_ 6 OUNCES (175 ML) FRESH LEMONADE_ 4 DASHES OF AROMATIC BITTERS  
(ANY KIND: IT’S UP TO YOU)
_ 4 OUNCES (120 ML) SELTZER WATERINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Combine the mead, lemonade and bitters ingredients in 
a mixing glass or pitcher. Stir to combine, and pour into 
four short glasses. Top each glass with about 1 ounce (25 
ml) of seltzer water. Serves four, so it won’t be long before 
you and three friends feel like the proverbial bee’s knees. 
Honey for health. Everyone knows that royal jelly, which is produced 
by worker bees and fed to their hive-mates, is an important curative in 
health preparations. But raw—that is, unprocessed —honey is also deeply 
curative, and what’s more, the distillation of spirits using raw honey is an 
ancient, well-regarded technique. Honey has been used medicinally at least 
since ancient Egyptian civilization, and beverages produced from honey, such as mead, have been enjoyed since time immemorial. "Mead is good,” 
wrote the nineteenth-century German herbalist, Sebastian Kneipp, because 
it “increases the hunger, stimulates digestion, purifies and strengthens the 
stomach, and frees the body of bad substances.” He wasn’t wrong: Raw 
honey may possess antibacterial qualities, and is said to promote weight 
loss, reduce cholesterol, and relieve symptoms of intestinal disorders. SIDENOTE

(Text)GRILLED TANGERINE SHRUB
JUST DOWN THE WAY FROM PARIS, TEXASIt really doesn’t take long to bring out the best in hardy, versatile tangerines. I like to grill my 
tangerines first to add a bit of char to their bright acidity. Then I coat them in simply syrup 
before combining them with yuzu vinegar, that Japanese kitchen staple—and a day later they’re 
ready for use in cocktails
What I’m about to tell you will change your life. Here it comes: bitters are marvelous in beer. 
And the Just Down The Way From Paris, Texas is living proof. There’s nothing complicated 
about it, but it does feature a couple of clever twists. The first is a little absinthe; the second, a 
portion of my Grilled Tangerine Shrub. When you combine the two with a good lager and a few 
drops of my homemade bitters, you get a cocktail that’s guaranteed to quench your thirst, even 
in the face of desert-level temperatures._ 10 SMALL TANGERINES, PEELED AND  
HALVED, AND SEARED IN A CAST-IRON  
PAN, THEN COOLED, SEGMENTED AND  
CHOPPED (RESERVE THE PEELS, REMOVE  
AS MUCH WHITE PITH AS POSSIBLE,  
AND SLICE INTO THIN STRIPS)
_ 1 CUP (235 ML) DEMERARA SIMPLE  
SYRUP (SEE PAGE 311)
_ 2–4 CUPS (475–940 ML) YUZU VINEGAR
_ 8 OUNCES (235 ML) LAGER BEER
_ 1/2 OUNCE (15 ML) TENNEYSON  
ABSINTHE ROYALE (FRANCE)
_ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) GRILLED  
TANGERINE SHRUB (SEE ABOVE)
_ 4 DROPS COCKTAIL WHISPERER’S RAW  
HONEY AROMATIC BITTERS (SEE PAGE 311)
_ THYME LEAVES, FOR GARNISH   INGREDIENTS
INGREDIENTSDIRECTIONS
DIRECTIONSTime: 48 hours. Combine the chopped tangerine segments and the 
sliced tangerine peels with the Demerara Simple Syrup in a nonreactive 
bowl, and stir to combine. Cover the bowl tightly and let the mixture 
sit for 24 hours, stirring several times to encourage fermentation and 
flavor development. Then add enough yuzu vinegar to cover the fruit 
mixture, and let it steep for another 24 hours. Finally, muddle the mixture a bit with a wooden spoon to release as much juice as possible 
from the tangerine segments, and strain the shrub into sterilized bottles 
or jars. Use immediately—or, if you have time, age in the fridge for 
a month. It’s wonderful with rum, vodka, and whiskey cocktails.
Add the Grilled Tangerine Shrub to a beer glass. Top with the 
beer and mix with a swizzle stick (I use a Belgian triple-style 
ale with a bit more alcohol). Pour the Absinthe over the top. 
Finish with 4 drops of the homemade cocktail bitters for good 
health and a garnish with a few leaves of fresh thyme.

(Text)GRILLED TANGERINE SHRUB
JUST DOWN THE WAY FROM PARIS, TEXASIt really doesn’t take long to bring out the best in hardy, versatile tangerines. I like to grill my 
tangerines first to add a bit of char to their bright acidity. Then I coat them in simply syrup 
before combining them with yuzu vinegar, that Japanese kitchen staple—and a day later they’re 
ready for use in cocktails
What I’m about to tell you will change your life. Here it comes: bitters are marvelous in beer. 
And the Just Down The Way From Paris, Texas is living proof. There’s nothing complicated 
about it, but it does feature a couple of clever twists. The first is a little absinthe; the second, a 
portion of my Grilled Tangerine Shrub. When you combine the two with a good lager and a few 
drops of my homemade bitters, you get a cocktail that’s guaranteed to quench your thirst, even 
in the face of desert-level temperatures._ 10 SMALL TANGERINES, PEELED AND  
HALVED, AND SEARED IN A CAST-IRON  
PAN, THEN COOLED, SEGMENTED AND  
CHOPPED (RESERVE THE PEELS, REMOVE  
AS MUCH WHITE PITH AS POSSIBLE,  
AND SLICE INTO THIN STRIPS)
_ 1 CUP (235 ML) DEMERARA SIMPLE  
SYRUP (SEE PAGE 311)
_ 2–4 CUPS (475–940 ML) YUZU VINEGAR
_ 8 OUNCES (235 ML) LAGER BEER
_ 1/2 OUNCE (15 ML) TENNEYSON  
ABSINTHE ROYALE (FRANCE)
_ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) GRILLED  
TANGERINE SHRUB (SEE ABOVE)
_ 4 DROPS COCKTAIL WHISPERER’S RAW  
HONEY AROMATIC BITTERS (SEE PAGE 311)
_ THYME LEAVES, FOR GARNISH   INGREDIENTS
INGREDIENTSDIRECTIONS
DIRECTIONSTime: 48 hours. Combine the chopped tangerine segments and the 
sliced tangerine peels with the Demerara Simple Syrup in a nonreactive 
bowl, and stir to combine. Cover the bowl tightly and let the mixture 
sit for 24 hours, stirring several times to encourage fermentation and 
flavor development. Then add enough yuzu vinegar to cover the fruit 
mixture, and let it steep for another 24 hours. Finally, muddle the mixture a bit with a wooden spoon to release as much juice as possible 
from the tangerine segments, and strain the shrub into sterilized bottles 
or jars. Use immediately—or, if you have time, age in the fridge for 
a month. It’s wonderful with rum, vodka, and whiskey cocktails.
Add the Grilled Tangerine Shrub to a beer glass. Top with the 
beer and mix with a swizzle stick (I use a Belgian triple-style 
ale with a bit more alcohol). Pour the Absinthe over the top. 
Finish with 4 drops of the homemade cocktail bitters for good 
health and a garnish with a few leaves of fresh thyme.

(Text)TWENTY-CUBIC-FEET OF SAIL 
As the old song goes, there’s nothing like a fresh’ning breeze. Well, there’s no doubt about it: This 
bracing cocktail is sure to put wind in your sails. It matches dry, spicy rye whiskey with an organic 
ginger liqueur that’s reminiscent of old-fashioned gingerbread—the kind made with plenty of fresh 
ginger, and lashings of blackstrap molasses. (Use a good organic ginger liqueur; you won’t want to 
adulterate this cocktail with anything sugary and sickly-sweet.) Then a dose of fresh lemon juice 
supplies a citrusy edge, while seltzer and bitters give the whole shebang a fizzy lift. I think it’s a great 
way to boost a flagging appetite, so try serving a round of Twenty-Cubic-Feet of Sail alongside hors 
d’oeuvres to get your next dinner party off to a rousing start. Anchors aweigh!

(Text)DOWN EAST MOCKTAIL
Fresh berries—like my favorite variety, the Maine Wild Blueberry—boast a lip-smacking acidity 
that’s just dazzling in alcohol-free libations. With its touch of balsamic vinegar, grilled orange juice, 
and lush Blueberry Simple Syrup, my Down East Mocktail involves making an instant-shrub-of-
sorts right in your cocktail glass—then topping the mixture up with a celebratory sparkle of seltzer 
water. This zesty, colorful mocktail is just the thing to whip up if you’re planning, say, a festive 
weekend brunch, a relaxed birthday lunch, or an early-afternoon engagement party. Sometimes you 
just don’t feel like downing mimosas or Bloody Marys before noon, so opt for a Down East instead: 
It’s got all the jubilance of a champagne-based cocktail minus the (not-so-jubilant) aftereffects.

(Text)OTHER ASSORTED TALES OF WOE TENNESSEE LAMENTATION
You’ve probably enjoyed a Dark and Stormy cocktail at some point in your drinking life. It’s usually 
made with a popular, brand name black rum from Bermuda and a very recognizable Bermudan 
ginger beer, and it has a sweet and sassy personality. You might be familiar with Dark and Stormy 
weather, but I bet you’ve never immersed yourself in assorted tales of woe. This variation on the 
D-and-S theme replaces the black rum with rye whiskey, and mixes it with spicy, cane sugar–based 
ginger beer, plus a shot of thickly sweet, Cuban-style espresso coffee. It’s a great pick-me-up for 
those fuzzy-headed days when you can’t decide whether to have a cocktail or a coffee. Now, you 
can mix business with pleasure and have them both at once. And I guarantee the tales of woe will 
change the way you think about rye whiskey—for the better, of course. The Jack-and-ginger combination is much maligned. While it has all the stuffing for a fla-
vor-driven experience that’s redolent of spice and smoke, it’s often ruined, unfortunately, by the 
use of super-sweet, cloying, corn syrup–based ginger ale instead of spicy, heady ginger beer. It’s 
time to draw the Jack-and-ginger into the twenty-first century, via the olden days of ships and 
sails. How? Implement a spicy, homemade ginger simple syrup that’s made with a dash of cayenne 
pepper and chunks of fresh ginger. That’s when the J-and-G metamorphoses into something 
ethereal, sophisticated—and exceptionally perilous. This recipe replaces sugary, mass-produced 
ginger ale with a homemade ginger beer of sorts—a radical step that turns the Tennessee 
Lamentation into an all-out celebration.

(Text)BILL MONROE’S KENTUCKY COOLER
No one who’s a fan of bluegrass music needs to be educated upon the merits of the late, great 
Bill Monroe, the Kentucky mandolinist who helped establish bluegrass as a genre. I can only 
imagine the various kinds of liquor that may—or may not—have been served in the early days 
of Monroe’s career as a performer. After all, he was active in the years just before Prohibition 
ended, and I’m sure folks didn’t always stick to sweet iced tea or milk while listening to his 
music! As tart and sweet as bluegrass itself, this cocktail balances white whiskey with lush peach 
and apricot nectars, plus a dose of iced tea and a dash of bitters. Of course, it’s just the thing 
for sipping on a long summer’s evening—but truth be told, it’s wonderful any time of the year.

shine, white whiskey is un-aged whiskey. Historically, white whiskey has had 
a reputation for being rough. (Or, perhaps, ruff! Get it? White Dog? Ruff? 
Ahem, sorry.) It’s been thought of as a rough-and-ready kind of drink, likely 
to be served in a pail, still hot, drained off a backwoods still just a few 
minutes prior to consumption. And, of course, it’s been rumored to be ridic-
ulously, unbelievably, mythologically intoxicating. Indeed, true “White Dog” 
was practically pure ethyl alcohol, exceeding 180 proof (that’s a staggering 
ninety percent ABV). Obviously, no liquor like the White Dog of days gone 
by is sold legally today. Thus, modern-day liquor producers have created 
new versions of the White Dog mystique: Some of them even pretty up their 
“moonshine” with candied fruits such as cherries or peaches, or suggest 
combining White Dog with soda to make it palatable. These products are 
not on my menu, and you won’t find them in this book. That’s not to say 
that there aren’t good white whiskeys on the market—there are, and they 
bear no resemblance to the awful stuff called moonshine. Try Tuthilltown

New York corn.SIDENOTECRAFT CURATIVES •

(Text)NIX BESSER COCKTAIL 
Nix besser means “none better” in Amish, and this cocktail lives up to its name. On a sweltering 
Saturday afternoon in August, there’s little else that can refresh and rejuvenate quite like the Nix 
Besser. Here, fresh, roasted peaches partner with the summery flavors of chiles, simple syrup, and 
Thai basil—and they make a run for bibulous infamy when combined with rye whiskey and freshly 
squeezed-citrus juices. Apothecaries might have recommended this cocktail because it is said to 
help heal a number of maladies, including heatstroke—plus, the peach has been used in traditional 
Chinese medicine for centuries to improve circulation and to relieve the symptoms of allergies. 
Purely from a gourmand’s POV, this body- and spirit-cooling preparation is also delicious as an 
aperitif before a leisurely meal on a summer evening.

SCENTS OF SALTWATER, HOT SAND, AND SUNSCREEN; FOURTH OF JULY PICNICS, COMPLETE  
WITH SPARKLERS, S’MORES, AND POTATO SALAD; BARBEQUES THAT STRETCH LATE INTO  
THE EVENING. BUT WHEN THE TEMPERATURE—AND THE HUMIDITY—SKYROCKETS, IT’S TRULY  
TOUGH TO BEAT THE HEAT. THAT’S WHEN WE ALL SCURRY INDOORS, CRANK UP THE AC, AND  
RAID THE FRIDGE IN SEARCH OF COLD DRINKS.    S ure, you want to cool down, and fast—but don’t reach for a beer or a sugary soda. Try a craft 
cocktail instead. As the pharmacists and apothecaries of yore would have known, there are 
plenty of handmade preparations that can help cool down sweaty bodies from the inside out. 
These curatives had to heal as well as refresh, so they’d have been made with herbs, spices, citrus fruits, 
and even fresh, garden-grown vegetables. (Traditionally, pharmacists would have used alcohol as a 
preservative to protect delicate herbs and spices from sweltering heat and spoilage.) We all know 
that it’s important to drink plenty of plain water year-round in order to stay healthy (especially 
when you’re drinking alcohol), but there are other ways to get your H20: the fresh citrus juices used 
in hot-weather cocktails, such as orange, lemon, lime, and pineapple, also offer a hit of hydration 
in addition to a dose of vitamin C. And drinks that call for fizzy water, such as club soda or seltzer, 
help you feel cooler a bit quicker thanks to those refreshing little bubbles, and they can help pep up 
flagging appetites, too. 
 Using exotic spices and flavorful ingredients such as hot chiles in cocktails can help bring down 
body temperature and aid healing. When we eat spicy foods such as chiles, we tend to sweat, which 
creates moisture on the surface of the skin. When the wind blows across damp skin, you feel cooler 
immediately. That’s why the Roasted Tomato and Chile Bloody Mary on page 96, enjoyed in the 
warmth of the sun, is so effective against overheating (not to mention hangovers). And anise, a key 
ingredient in anisette, one of the key ingredients in the Orange Zest Oasis on page 80, is renowned as 
a relaxant for both body and mind, and as a cure for all manner of digestive disorders. It’s no accident 
that it’s often enjoyed before or after meals: it soothes the belly and calms the brain. Fresh coconut 
water, which takes center stage in the Coconut Cooler on page 87, carries precious potassium, which 
is a valuable electrolyte that’s depleted through sweating. (Maybe that’s why the pina colada is such 
a popular beach-side tipple!) 
 But cooling cocktails aren’t necessarily all about exotic flavors. Fruits and vegetables from your 
own garden pack powerful healing properties, too. Use your harvest to make a batch of the English 
Pea and Mint Shrub on page 94, then combine it with Rhum Agricole, lime juice, bitters, and a dash 
of appetite-boosting nutmeg it in a Last-Minute Rumpus. Or, if you’ve got rhubarb—also known as 
“pie plant”—in your garden, put it to good use in your cocktails. Old-time pharmacists certainly would 
have, since rhubarb has been used in healing for centuries. And it’s delicious in cool drinks like the 
Rhubarb Fizz with Charred Strawberries on page 84–85. If you’d rather skip the booze altogether, go 
ahead: try my Tiki Mocktail on page 88–89, or Mr. Rankeillor’s Door—a simple concoction of my 
Cucumber-Basil Shrub plus a little soda water, bitters, and sea salt—on page 113. Never fear: these 
mocktails are so flavorful that you won’t miss the booze, not even a little bit.
 Don’t let the dog days of summer get you down! Embrace the heat with these rejuvenating

(Text)ORANGE ZEST OASIS
THE RUNAWAY MOUNTAIN TRAIN Pharmacists of old might have treated hot, parched bodies with anise, which is said to be both 
calming and cooling to the overheated constitution, plus other herbs and spices—and, of course, 
the whole lot would have been preserved in a hefty dose of high-proof alcohol. This sweet-and-
bitter cocktail takes its inspiration from just such a combination: Here, muddled oranges bathed 
in dry sake offset the fragrant anisette. 
If you’re like me, the mere mention of muddled blueberries makes your mouth water: think 
plucking sun-warmed wild blueberries straight from the bush and popping them straight into 
your mouth; think freshly baked blueberry pie topped with vanilla ice cream. Sigh. This cocktail 
mixes those summertime pleasures with smoky millet whiskey and a fragrant hit of maple syrup 
for a lightly fizzy drink that’s delicious any time of year (although it’s best made with wild 
blueberries, if you can get them!) As in life, so in the art of mixology: Y ou need the salt and the 
bitters to balance the cocktail’s luscious sweetness. _ 2 ORANGE SLICES, CUT INTO QUARTERS

(Text)GINGER-LIME SHRUB GINGER-LIME SHRUB WITH RHUM AGRICOLE AND SALTY LEMONADE
It’s likely that a version of this luscious shrub would have been served aboard sailing ships in 
days of yore, so that thirsty sailors could escape scurvy. Fragile citrus fruit wouldn’t have lasted 
long, but luckily, the apple cider vinegar in this recipe acts as a powerful preservative. These days, 
a Ginger-Lime Shrub is a flavorful addition to dozens of thirst-quenching cocktails—especially 
ones involving rum. Hard to starboard, lads! This easy-to-make but very grown-up glass of lemonade also showcases that classic ginger-lime-
rum combination. I make mine with a healthy portion of 100-proof Rhum Agricole (which, if 
drunk on its own, is guaranteed to put hair on your eyeballs). Rhum Agricole is handmade on the 
French island of Martinique, and it’s never factory-produced, which is why I prefer it. But, in a 
pinch, any good white rum will do. Add a toothsome crunch to your lemonade by sprinkling a 
little fleur de sel, or sea salt, into it. The salt-lemon combination will make you thirsty, but the 
sugar and vinegar in the shrub syrup will quench your thirst in double time. This cocktail makes 
a great summertime aperitif: Mix up a batch at your next barbeque.

INGREDIENTSDIRECTIONS
Time: 3–4 weeks.  In a nonreactive bowl, combine the sugar, 
lime peels, lime chunks, and the ginger. Stir to combine and coat all 
the fruit with sugar. Cover and leave at room temperature at least 
overnight or for 1–2 days. (Slow, cool fermentation gives a shrub its 
trademark bite.)  Now prepare your shrub for aging. Set a strainer 
over another nonreactive bowl and pour the lime and ginger chunks 
into the strainer. Use a stout wooden spoon to extract as much juice 
as possible from the limes and the softened ginger chunks. Let the 
mixture sit for a few more hours. Stir again, and discard the fruit 
chunks. Stir in the vinegar, and then use a funnel to transfer the 
shrub syrup to a sterilized bottle. Seal, and then shake well to combine. 
Store the bottles in the refrigerator or at cellar temperature for 3–4 
weeks before using. Shake each bottle once or twice daily to help 
the sugar dissolve. When it’s mostly dissolved, your shrub is ready 
to use. Makes 11/2 cups. Keep refrigerated, and use within about 
6 months. (If the bottle gets foamy, changes radically in color, or if 
you suddenly notice small sea animals gorging themselves on thin 
wafers inside the bottle, just throw it out. If you don’t tell anyone 
about the sea animals or the thin wafers, I promise I won’t, either.)

It’s likely that a version of this luscious shrub would have been served aboard sailing ships in 
days of yore, so that thirsty sailors could escape scurvy. Fragile citrus fruit wouldn’t have lasted 
long, but luckily, the apple cider vinegar in this recipe acts as a powerful preservative. These days, 
a Ginger-Lime Shrub is a flavorful addition to dozens of thirst-quenching cocktails—especially 
ones involving rum. Hard to starboard, lads! This easy-to-make but very grown-up glass of lemonade also showcases that classic ginger-lime-
rum combination. I make mine with a healthy portion of 100-proof Rhum Agricole (which, if 
drunk on its own, is guaranteed to put hair on your eyeballs). Rhum Agricole is handmade on the 
French island of Martinique, and it’s never factory-produced, which is why I prefer it. But, in a 
pinch, any good white rum will do. Add a toothsome crunch to your lemonade by sprinkling a 
little fleur de sel, or sea salt, into it. The salt-lemon combination will make you thirsty, but the 
sugar and vinegar in the shrub syrup will quench your thirst in double time. This cocktail makes 
a great summertime aperitif: Mix up a batch at your next barbeque.

_ 1/2 OUNCE (15 ML) SELTZER WATER
_ 1 PINCH FLEUR DE SEL  _ 2–3 DROPS LIME BITTERS_ HAND-CUT ICE SPEARINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONSTime: 3–4 weeks.  In a nonreactive bowl, combine the sugar, 
lime peels, lime chunks, and the ginger. Stir to combine and coat all 
the fruit with sugar. Cover and leave at room temperature at least 
overnight or for 1–2 days. (Slow, cool fermentation gives a shrub its 
trademark bite.)  Now prepare your shrub for aging. Set a strainer 
over another nonreactive bowl and pour the lime and ginger chunks 
into the strainer. Use a stout wooden spoon to extract as much juice 
as possible from the limes and the softened ginger chunks. Let the 
mixture sit for a few more hours. Stir again, and discard the fruit 
chunks. Stir in the vinegar, and then use a funnel to transfer the 
shrub syrup to a sterilized bottle. Seal, and then shake well to combine. 
Store the bottles in the refrigerator or at cellar temperature for 3–4 
weeks before using. Shake each bottle once or twice daily to help 
the sugar dissolve. When it’s mostly dissolved, your shrub is ready 
to use. Makes 11/2 cups. Keep refrigerated, and use within about 
6 months. (If the bottle gets foamy, changes radically in color, or if 
you suddenly notice small sea animals gorging themselves on thin 
wafers inside the bottle, just throw it out. If you don’t tell anyone 
about the sea animals or the thin wafers, I promise I won’t, either.)  Add the Ginger-Lime Shrub to a Collins-style glass. Then add the ice 
spear. Top with the Rhum Agricole Blanc, the lemonade, and a splash 
of seltzer water. Sprinkle a pinch of fleur de sel into the drink, and 
finish with a couple drops of lime bitters. It’s ridiculously refreshing. HOT WEATHER HEALERS •

(Text)RHUBARB FIZZ WITH CHARRED STRAWBERRIES
Fizzes are delicious, revitalizing preparations that suspend healing botanicals, liquors, and/or 
juices in seltzer water, and the Rhubarb Fizz is a famous—or infamous—example. Add some 
botanical gin, the effervescence of seltzer water, and plenty of crushed ice, and you’ve got a cooling 
cocktail that’s powerfully restorative. (Gin is an analgesic, by the way, so this is just the thing for 
that heat-induced headache.)

Add about 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the charred strawberries and 
the simple syrup to a Boston shaker. Muddle them until they 
make a fragrant pulp. Then add the rhubarb tea liqueur and 
the botanical gin, and pile the crushed ice over the liquors and 
strawberries until the shaker is three-quarters full. Shake well 
for twenty seconds, scoop some of the crushed ice into a coupé 
glass (its texture will have become slushy), strain the mixture 
over the ice, and top with seltzer water. Prepare to be healed! 
Rhubarb as a remedy. Rhubarb has been used in folk medicine 
for thousands of years, and, legend has it, first arrived in the United States 
when Benjamin Franklin brought rhubarb seeds from Europe in the late 
eighteenth century. Famed for its powerful purgative, laxative qualities, 
rhubarb (the stems, not the leaves: rhubarb leaves are toxic. Consider 
yourself warned) has been known to ease blockages of the digestive tract 
that may stem from poor diet. And it’s rich in vitamin C, vitamin A, and 
potassium, too. Plus, according to legend, it’s an aphrodisiac. But there’s 
only one way to find out if that’s true: Whip up a pair of Rhubarb Fizzes next 
time you’ve got someone special over on a sultry summer’s night, and see 
where the evening takes you. SIDENOTE

Switchel: The original energy drink. Also known as haymaker’s punch, thirsty farmers relied on 
switchel for centuries in order to stay hydrated while working outdoors under the sun, long before manufactured 
energy drinks were available on the market. It’s a close cousin of shrubs: in fact, the only difference between 
them is that shrubs contain fermented fruit or vegetables, while switchel doesn’t. Like shrubs, it’s powerfully 
thirst-quenching, thanks to the vinegar in it—plus, since it’s made with maple syrup, which is a natural source of 
sugar, it can give you a much-needed energy boost on sweltering summer afternoons. (That’s no bad thing—espe-
cially if you’re an iced-coffee addict trying to cut back on the hard stuff.) And, of course, switchel is free from all 
the colorings, additives, preservatives, and synthetic sweeteners that most of us try to avoid. That’s a win-win! 
These days, switchel is popping up in cutting-edge cocktail bars around the country. But if you don’t fancy heading 
to your local bar—or relying on pre-made versions—here’s some good news: It’s so easy to make your own. All it takes is four ingredients, and it’s ready to use very quickly, either on its own or in craft cocktails: it takes just 24

their fingertips. I'm not one of them.) Add the Rhum Agricole through one 
of the holes, using a funnel if necessary. Stick a straw into each of the holes,

Switchel originated in the Caribbean, and quickly became popular in the United States. And, 
like shrubs, it’s definitely making a comeback. Top a portion with a couple drops of my Cocktail 
Whisperer’s Raw Honey Aromatic Bitters (see page 311), and a little soda water, if you like. It’s a 
great way to chill out during hot, humid weather.

_ 4 TABLESPOONS (60 ML) GRADE B (OR  
DARK AMBER/COOKING) MAPLE SYRUP
_ 1 TABLESPOON (8 G) OF GRATED

WATER (WHATEVER YOU DO, DON’T  
SUBSTITUTE TAP WATER!)  INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Time: 24 hours. Combine all the ingredients in a sterilized 
Mason jar. Cover tightly and store in the fridge for at least 24 
hours, shaking to combine the ingredients. This lasts for several 
months in the fridge. 
Switchel: The original energy drink. Also known as haymaker’s punch, thirsty farmers relied on 
switchel for centuries in order to stay hydrated while working outdoors under the sun, long before manufactured 
energy drinks were available on the market. It’s a close cousin of shrubs: in fact, the only difference between 
them is that shrubs contain fermented fruit or vegetables, while switchel doesn’t. Like shrubs, it’s powerfully 
thirst-quenching, thanks to the vinegar in it—plus, since it’s made with maple syrup, which is a natural source of 
sugar, it can give you a much-needed energy boost on sweltering summer afternoons. (That’s no bad thing—espe -
cially if you’re an iced-coffee addict trying to cut back on the hard stuff.) And, of course, switchel is free from all 
the colorings, additives, preservatives, and synthetic sweeteners that most of us try to avoid. That’s a win-win! 
These days, switchel is popping up in cutting-edge cocktail bars around the country. But if you don’t fancy heading 
to your local bar—or relying on pre-made versions—here’s some good news: It’s so easy to make your own. All it 
takes is four ingredients, and it’s ready to use very quickly, either on its own or in craft cocktails: it takes just 24 
hours in the fridge. Then you can strain your switchel into rocks glasses filled with ice and an ounce (30 ml) of either 
brandy or dark rum for an instant pick-me up. SIDENOTECOCONUT COOLER
_ ONE LARGE COCONUT, CHILLED
_ 6 OUNCES (175 ML) RHUM AGRICOLEINGREDIENTSIn the Caribbean islands, old-time pharmacists might have been called on to help patients counter 
the effects of too much sun. Their solution was probably a simple one, relying on potassium-packed 
coconut water for hydration and for a much-needed blast of potassium, and local rum to ease the 
sufferer’s body and mind. Pharmacists may have packed their coconuts in ice overnight to ensure 
that the coconut water—the nutrient-dense, milky liquid inside the fruit—was well-chilled before 
punching holes in them in order to pour a healthy dose of rum inside. Since coconut water has 
plenty of potassium and other electrolytes, it’s a speedy way to replenish much-needed nutrients in 
the midst of mind-boggling heat. And the best part is, there’s no glass to wash afterwards.

Chill the coconut by keeping it on ice overnight, or by storing it in the 
refrigerator. Using a drill, puncture three holes into the coconut (but don’t 
discard the precious water inside!) (In the islands, a machete is often used 
to punch holes into coconuts. Some people who use machetes are missing 
their fingertips. I'm not one of them.) Add the Rhum Agricole through one 
of the holes, using a funnel if necessary. Stick a straw into each of the holes, 
and sip the contents while cheek-to-cheek with a close friend. Serves 2.In the Caribbean islands, old-time pharmacists might have been called on to help patients counter

(Text)Get ready to stage a return to the 1940s and 50s, when tiki culture reigned supreme—especially 
in matters of food and drink. This velvety, coconut-scented, tropically influenced mocktail will 
take you there in a jiffy. Buy yourself a bottle of orgeat: it’s a softly textured syrup that’s enlivened 
with almonds, pure cane sugar, and either rose- or orange-flower water. In my Tiki Mocktail, 
it’s combined with the usual tiki-esque suspects: lemon, lime, orange, and grapefruit juices, plus 
coconut cream and the requisite pineapple juice. But there’s a twist: Toasty, smoky chicory powder 
adds the richness of rum to the mix, even though this drink is liquor-free. Decadent and slightly 
kitschy, you’ll be thrilled that you can drink as many of these as you like with no fear of the 
consequences. Best served alongside a grass skirt and a lei.

(Text)Bitters aren’t for savory cocktails only. They’ve long been key features of tropical libations, like 
the famous Peruvian Pisco Sour. In this twisted version of that classic, I’ve replaced the Pisco 
with Cachaça, a kind of sugarcane-based, barrel-aged, distilled spirit that’s the very soul of Brazil. 
Don’t indulge in more than two of these, though; they’re treacherously smooth.

Mix the Cachaça and chartreuse with the Ginger-Lime Shrub. 
Add the fresh lime juice, the simple syrup, and the egg white to 
your Boston Shaker, and then add enough bar ice to fill to shaker 
three-quarters full. Cap and shake hard for 15 seconds. Put a fistful 
of smashed ice into a coupe glass, and pour the mixture over. Dot 
grapefruit bitters directly on top of the egg white foam, and serve.
Crush your ice in a Lewis bag. If you’re a rabid home mixolo-
gist, you probably find yourself crushing or smashing ice for your cocktails 
all the time. Do you resort to sticking it into a plastic bag and whacking it 
with a rolling pin, only to have the bag burst—again? Well, quit it. Invest in 
a Lewis bag instead. Lewis bags are made of heavy-duty canvas, and they 
can really take a beating: Fill yours with ice, close it, then pound it with a 
wooden mallet until the ice has reached the right texture, and you’re done. 
The bag helps wick the moisture away from the smashed ice, and it’s easy to 
store in a kitchen drawer or cupboard, too. SIDENOTETWISTED CACHAÇA SOUR

Mix the Cachaça and chartreuse with the Ginger-Lime Shrub. 
Add the fresh lime juice, the simple syrup, and the egg white to 
your Boston Shaker, and then add enough bar ice to fill to shaker 
three-quarters full. Cap and shake hard for 15 seconds. Put a fistful 
of smashed ice into a coupe glass, and pour the mixture over. Dot 
grapefruit bitters directly on top of the egg white foam, and serve.
Crush your ice in a Lewis bag. If you’re a rabid home mixolo -
gist, you probably find yourself crushing or smashing ice for your cocktails 
all the time. Do you resort to sticking it into a plastic bag and whacking it 
with a rolling pin, only to have the bag burst—again? Well, quit it. Invest in 
a Lewis bag instead. Lewis bags are made of heavy-duty canvas, and they 
can really take a beating: Fill yours with ice, close it, then pound it with a 
wooden mallet until the ice has reached the right texture, and you’re done. 
The bag helps wick the moisture away from the smashed ice, and it’s easy to 
store in a kitchen drawer or cupboard, too. SIDENOTETWISTED CACHAÇA SOUR

the famous Peruvian Pisco Sour. In this twisted version of that classic, I’ve replaced the Pisco 
with Cachaça, a kind of sugarcane-based, barrel-aged, distilled spirit that’s the very soul of Brazil. 
Don’t indulge in more than two of these, though; they’re treacherously smooth.

Ice is the major consideration here, so please make your coconut water ice the day before—or at 
least eight hours before—you plan to enjoy one of these. The ice must be perfectly firm so that 
it can be shaved properly. How does one shave ice, you ask? Buy or borrow a woodworker’s rasp 
(if you decide to do the latter, please remove all wood splinters, oils, et cetera, before you attempt 
to shave the ice!) The consistency you’re going for is a sort of a fine, slushy, coconutty gravel. 
Combined with whisky and a dash of spice from Teapot Bitters, this mysterious combination of 
South Asian ingredients mimics India’s sweet-and-spicy chai tea. Remember, don’t use the cheap 
stuff: Use only a high-quality brand of single-malt Indian whisky for this cocktail.Strangely enough, star anise isn’t related to aniseed—although the two herbs share a distinctive, 
licorice flavor, and both are used to alleviate upset stomachs and freshen breath. Star anise is 
frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine to warm the body and stimulate circulation. It’s 
also said to possess antibacterial and antifungal qualities, and is often added to hot tea in order 
to relieve persistent colds, coughs, and other flu symptoms. This curative, an Asian-influenced 
take on the classic iced tea, is a great way to lift flagging spirits and refresh hot, tired bodies on 
a sultry summer day. Anise, ginger, and lemon are flavorful complements to one another, while antioxidant-rich Chinese black tea may be good for heart health.

(Text)ENGLISH PEA AND MINT SHRUB
Shrubs don’t need to be fruit-based—and neither do cocktails. Ready in just a day and a half, 
sweet peas and fragrant mint take center stage in this toothsome shrub that’s inspired by your 
springtime vegetable garden. They’re mixed with richly textured Demerara sugar, and then quickly 
preserved in luxurious champagne vinegar, and the result is a most beguiling, bright-green syrup 
that’s a surprising, refreshing complement to white rum, or even to plain seltzer water. If you can tie yourself to the mast and avoid the shrub’s siren call, go ahead and age it in the fridge for a 
month—but I bet you won’t be able to restrain yourself from using it the minute it’s ready.

Time: 36 hours. Combine the blanched, lightly crushed peas 
and simple syrup in a nonreactive bowl, and let them sit at room 
temperature overnight. The next morning, stir the mixture well 
with a wooden spoon, and then add the champagne vinegar 
and slapped mint. Stir again, and keep in the fridge for 24 
hours so that the flavors combine (be sure to keep your bowl 
well-covered: You don’t want your delicate flavors ruined by 
that bowl of leftover garlic pasta that lives on the other side of 
the fridge!). Place a sieve over another nonreactive bowl, and transfer the mixture to the sieve, pressing down so as to extract 
as much juice and pea solids as possible. Funnel the mixture 
into sterilized bottles or jars, and use immediately. Or, let it 
ferment for up to another month or two in the fridge, shaking 
the bottles daily so that the sumptuous flavors combine.
LAST-MINUTE RUMPUS
Try serving this savory libation alongside a first course, like a simple salad of avocado, citrus, and

hours so that the flavors combine (be sure to keep your bowl 
well-covered: You don’t want your delicate flavors ruined by 
that bowl of leftover garlic pasta that lives on the other side of 
the fridge!). Place a sieve over another nonreactive bowl, and transfer the mixture to the sieve, pressing down so as to extract 
as much juice and pea solids as possible. Funnel the mixture 
into sterilized bottles or jars, and use immediately. Or, let it 
ferment for up to another month or two in the fridge, shaking 
the bottles daily so that the sumptuous flavors combine.

(Text)ENGLISH PEA AND MINT SHRUB
Shrubs don’t need to be fruit-based—and neither do cocktails. Ready in just a day and a half, 
sweet peas and fragrant mint take center stage in this toothsome shrub that’s inspired by your 
springtime vegetable garden. They’re mixed with richly textured Demerara sugar, and then quickly 
preserved in luxurious champagne vinegar, and the result is a most beguiling, bright-green syrup 
that’s a surprising, refreshing complement to white rum, or even to plain seltzer water. If you can tie yourself to the mast and avoid the shrub’s siren call, go ahead and age it in the fridge for a 
month—but I bet you won’t be able to restrain yourself from using it the minute it’s ready.
Time: 36 hours. Combine the blanched, lightly crushed peas 
and simple syrup in a nonreactive bowl, and let them sit at room 
temperature overnight. The next morning, stir the mixture well 
with a wooden spoon, and then add the champagne vinegar 
and slapped mint. Stir again, and keep in the fridge for 24 
hours so that the flavors combine (be sure to keep your bowl 
well-covered: You don’t want your delicate flavors ruined by 
that bowl of leftover garlic pasta that lives on the other side of 
the fridge!). Place a sieve over another nonreactive bowl, and transfer the mixture to the sieve, pressing down so as to extract 
as much juice and pea solids as possible. Funnel the mixture

(Text)ROASTED TOMATO AND CHILI BLOODY MARY
One of the best things about summertime is that gardens and farmers’ markets overflow with juicy 
melons, succulent strawberries, delicate lettuces, and firm, deep-red tomatoes. It’s the perfect time 
to cool down with this spicy twist on the classic Bloody Mary. Trust me, the rich flavor of roasted 
tomatoes really makes it worth turning on the oven, even in sizzling heat.

Combine all the ingredients except the celery salt in a large

before serving, sprinkle the celery salt over the top of the 
drink. Garnish with a lemon wedge. Find a spot in the shade, 
sip slowly, and cool down from the inside out. Serves 2. One evening I found myself sampling a large selection of French eau de vie—strong, clear fruit 
brandy—at the New York restaurant Rouge Tomate. One of the many liquors I tried that night 
was made with—count ‘em—62 different varieties of heirloom tomato. The haunting tomatoey 
taste and fragrance infused each sip. Then my thoughts turned to Poire William, an eau de vie 
that’s made from impossibly tart pears. What if, I thought, it were possible to combine those tart 
pears with a portion of the tomato eau de vie—combined, say, with a touch of vinegar, crumbled 
sage, and simple syrup? Stop right there: Before you object, “Where on earth am I going to get 
tomato eau de vie?” I have the answer: Skip the eau de vie, and make a batch of my Heirloom 
Tomato, Pear, and Sage Shrub instead. It’s an incredible partner for gin-based cocktails.

(Text)Y ou might not think that Scotch is a match for Tiki-style drinks, with their fresh citrus juices and 
coconutty sweetness—but now is the time to think again. The saline, smoky finish of, say, an Islay 
Scotch whisky makes it just as desirable in tropical cocktails as hearty, barrel-aged rum. Named 
for the Norse god of thunder, Another Thor mixes good Islay Scotch with orange, pineapple, 
lemon, and lime juices, as well as a little orgeat syrup (orgeat is a sweet, almond-flavored syrup 
that’s used in lots of cocktails, such as the Mai Tai). A dash of curried bitters and a splash of 
palate-lifting club soda make for a surprising finish to this sultry summery cocktail. It’s just the 
thing for sipping poolside—or, if you’re on vacation, at brunch.

even plain seltzer. And they make beautiful music together. So what’s the perfect finale to such

finish, plus the crunch of a pinch of fleur de sel, not to mention an elegant grapefruit twist in 
place of the typical (read: ho-hum) lime wheel. The finished product is so memorable that you’ll

Holland, when distillers first produced a spirit from malt wine, then flavored 
it with juniper (or genever) berries and other botanicals—perhaps angelica, 
anise seeds, cassia bark, coriander seeds, and citrus peel. It was originally 
sold in pharmacies, since juniper berries were reputed to have valuable 
medicinal benefits: they were thought to aid digestion, ease rheumatism, 
and to act as an antibacterial. But by the mid-eighteenth century, gin had 
lost its reputation as a stimulating curative, and gained notoriety as a social 
poison. Because it was cheaply produced and sold, it was easy for members 
of every social class to overindulge, and by the nineteenth century, it earned 
the nickname “mother’s ruin,” since it led so many young men (and women) 
into lives of debauchery.   
Today, thankfully, gin has shed its seedy reputation at last, and artisan 
distillers are making small-batch pot-still versions of old-time gin styles—
both dry and sweet—and restoring them to their former glory. Take, for 
example, Old Tom gin: Wildly popular in eighteenth-century London, it’s 
enjoying a renaissance these days. It’s sweeter than most contemporary 
gins, and that means it doesn’t need a sugar-laden tonic water to balance it out—which is why it works so well in A Chorus of Voices. Don’t be afraid to 
do your own research: head to your local “gin palace,” and try a few of the 
many excellent craft gins on the market. SIDENOTEHOT WEATHER HEALERS •

(Text)Whenever I find myself with less-than-perfect-looking produce on hand, I head straight to the 
grill. Grilling is a great way to harness the flavors of slightly overripe fruits and vegetables. It 
transforms their flavor profiles by bringing out their natural sugars. And grilled produce is lovely 
when it’s turned into a shrub. Try to let this shrub age for a full month before you use it, since it 
definitely improves with age. (And as always, I implore you to use fresh ingredients—always. If 
a recipe calls for produce that’s out of season, replace it with a similar seasonal ingredient, and 
change the recipe accordingly. Never ever use the canned or frozen variety if you can help it.)

with the Demerara sugar and sea salt. Stir well to combine, then cover 
tightly and place the bowl in the fridge or a cool, dark place, stirring 
several times daily for about 2 days. Place a sieve over another nonre-
active bowl, and then transfer the mixture to the sieve. Use a wooden 
spoon to press the slightly fermented peach solids and liquids through 
the sieve. Discard the fruit pulp. Add the vinegar and the Thai basil: 
stir again, then let the mixture sit for a few hours. Funnel the shrub 
into sterilized bottles or jars, then store in the fridge for a month, 
shaking the bottle or jar a couple times daily. (Patience is a necessary 
ingredient in this shrub!) It’s delicious in my Mendham Cocktail.GRILLED PEACH AND THAI BASIL SHRUB

transforms their flavor profiles by bringing out their natural sugars. And grilled produce is lovely 
when it’s turned into a shrub. Try to let this shrub age for a full month before you use it, since it 
definitely improves with age. (And as always, I implore you to use fresh ingredients—always. If 
a recipe calls for produce that’s out of season, replace it with a similar seasonal ingredient, and 
change the recipe accordingly. Never ever use the canned or frozen variety if you can help it.)

(Text)Some of the sweetest peaches I’ve ever slurped are grown in and around Mendham, a rural New 
Jersey town, located about an hour north-by-northwest of New York City. Historically, Mendham

I’ll bet my wages that those Mendham peaches were just as delicious two and half centuries ago 
as they are today. This cocktail puts my Grilled Peach and Thai Basil Shrubb in the driver’s seat, 
alongside a good bourbon like Four Roses and soupcon of Rhum Agricole—its sweetly perfumed 
flavor profile makes for a haunting, memorable finish. A zap of fizzy water and a few drops of 
spicy Moroccan-style cocktail bitters—a twenty-first century emendation—and the job’s done.

(Text)This refreshing, rye-based cocktail is just the thing to whet your appetite before a good lunch on 
a late summer’s day. In addition to rye, it features Pimm’s No. 1 Cup, the citrusy-spicy English 
liqueur, which is most agreeable when served with fresh juices and Caribbean spices. That’s where 
allspice dram, a liqueur flavored with allspice berries, comes in: Along with the Pimm’s, it gives 
the drink a dark-red stain that’s decidedly preppy (it’s the exact color of Nantucket Red trousers). 
If all this sounds terribly exotic, never fear: Rye whiskey and apple cider, that familiar, time-hon-
ored combo, are at the heart of this cocktail. An easy-to-make, uncomplicated tipple, there’s one 
tried-and-true way to drink the Late Summer Fizz that I wholeheartedly recommend: with two 
long straws, and a great deal of relish.

(Text)MR. RANKEILLOR’S DOOR CUCUMBER-BASIL SHRUB
Faced with a thirst so pernicious that plain water, cocktails, sports drinks, and soft drinks all stand 
helpless before it? Well, help is indeed at hand, because your palate is about to become acquainted 
with Mr. Rankeillor’s Door. Named—with good reason—for “a shrewd, ruddy, kindly, consequen-
tial man in a well-powdered wig and spectacles” from Robert Louis Stevenson’s Kidnapped, this 
mocktail is just what you need to revive your spirits and sharpen your appetite for lunch. And, darn 
it, it’s just so easy to make. Here, a flavorsome whack of my Cucumber-Basil Shrub gets pepped 
up with seltzer water, the barest pinch of sea salt, and my homemade bitters—and that’s all there 
is to it. I drink Mr. Rankeillor’s Doors all year round, but it really is the ticket when summer’s heat 
is at its highest. The scent and taste of freshly picked cucumbers straight off the vine is the scent and taste of high 
summer. When it’s concentrated into a summery shrub like this one, it’s even more delicious. And 
it goes so well with Thai basil’s fresh bite (I like to use the Thai variety, since it has a bit more 
spice to it). That’s just about all there is to my Cucumber-Basil Shrub, which is breathtakingly 
easy to assemble, and which matures very quickly—in only about a week. Use European-style 
seedless cukes to make this shrub: Slimmer and smoother-skinned, they’re a slightly different 
beast to the usual garden-variety ones. You could use it in gin-based cocktails, or in cooling, 
refreshing virgin tipples, like Mr. Rankeillor’s Door (see page 113).

Faced with a thirst so pernicious that plain water, cocktails, sports drinks, and soft drinks all stand 
helpless before it? Well, help is indeed at hand, because your palate is about to become acquainted 
with Mr. Rankeillor’s Door. Named—with good reason—for “a shrewd, ruddy, kindly, consequen-
tial man in a well-powdered wig and spectacles” from Robert Louis Stevenson’s Kidnapped, this 
mocktail is just what you need to revive your spirits and sharpen your appetite for lunch. And, darn 
it, it’s just so easy to make. Here, a flavorsome whack of my Cucumber-Basil Shrub gets pepped 
up with seltzer water, the barest pinch of sea salt, and my homemade bitters—and that’s all there 
is to it. I drink Mr. Rankeillor’s Doors all year round, but it really is the ticket when summer’s heat

(Text)Most cocktails with the word “tropical” in their names call for rum and only rum—but if it’s a 
recipe by the Cocktail Whisperer, anything can happen! This sumptuous drink features wheat 
whiskey, which is very different to whiskey made from one hundred percent corn. It’s softer in 
the mouth, and the finish goes on and on—and on. It’s very elegant stuff. So treat it right: Make 
your own grenadine (it’s not hard), and use good dark rum if you can, since it’s such a match for 
smoky-sweet grilled pineapple juice. (The juice from grilled pineapple has a slightly “charred”  
taste, which rounds out the necessary acidity in this new American classic.) Go ahead and mix up 
a second batch, if you like—just don’t hold me responsible for your headache the next morning!

Add the first six ingredients to a mixing glass with a few 
chunks of ice. Stir well. Add the pinch of sea salt (don’t skip 
the salt: It’s an essential ingredient!) and stir again. Add one 
large cube of hand-cut ice to a rocks glass. Strain into rocks 
glasses, top with the club soda, and then garnish each glass with 
a spear of grilled pineapple and a lemon zest twist, squeezing 
it gently to release its fragrant oils. Serves two thirsty heads. 
Get grilling. If you’re not charring or grilling your fruit for use in 
your cocktails (either as garnishes, for muddling, or as soon-to-be fresh-
ly-squeezed juices), now’s the time to start. Why? Charring or grilling fruits 
and vegetables intensifies their flavors; it draws out their natural sugars 
in the same way that onions become sweeter when you caramelize them. 
Start with a slightly-underripe stone fruit, like a fresh peach. Slice it into 
eighths, then place the slices on a hot grill (or grill pan) for a minute or two 
per side. Let cool, then use judiciously in your craft cocktails. SIDENOTETROPICALISTA SUNRISE COCKTAIL

(Text)The original Rock and Rye cocktail, a mixture of rye whiskey, simple syrup, and citrus fruits, was 
a nineteenth- and twentieth-century classic. The simple concoction was believed to be a cure for 
chest congestion, stubborn coughs, and even the common cold. This delicious spin on the Rock 
and Rye calls for a special ingredient that tips its hat to the early era of medicinal folk healers. It’s 
called root tea, but it’s not the kind of tea you’d drink alongside your breakfast bagel. Based on 
a recipe that’s said to have been handed down by Native Americans to pre-colonial settlers, root 
tea liqueur is a spirit that’s been developed to imitate the original flavors and healing techniques 
of the early apothecary age, using natural materials such as birch bark, sassafras, anise, and cloves. 
Thanks to root tea liqueur, the Root and Rye gently becalms uneasy bellies, and is especially 
refreshing on hot summer days.

(Text)This simple cocktail features three of my favorite ingredients: white whiskey, organic root tea 
liqueur, and frozen hot chocolate. With its crunchy, slushy texture, Where’s the Dog Star? is more 
than a mere tipple: It’s also a healing tonic of the highest order. That’s because root tea liqueur 
is a combination of hand-selected medicinal spices and extracts of healing roots, suspended and 
preserved in alcohol. Add a healthy dose of white whiskey to the mix, plus some homemade 
frozen hot chocolate, and you’ve got a fortifying cocktail that’ll keep your spirits up despite 
blustery weather and howling gales. Try it on its own on a stormy afternoon; as a dessert (in all 
weathers); or, best of all, as a nightcap. It’s a fabulous restorative for both body and soul.

Prepare the Best Hot Chocolate, and let it cool a little. Pour into 
an ice-cube tray, and freeze 8 hours or overnight. Pop the hot 
chocolate ice cubes into a blender and crush, or place them into a 
Lewis bag—a canvas bag especially made for crushing ice—and 
crush by hand by banging them with a wooden mallet. (It’s actually 
a lot of fun!) Spoon the crushed, frozen hot chocolate into a parfait 
glass, and then add the white whiskey and the root tea liqueur. 
Mix gently. Serve with both a straw and a long-handled spoon. WHERE’S THE DOG STAR?

(Text)WITH THEIR SHORT DAYS AND LONG NIGHTS, AUTUMN AND WINTER HERALD THE YEAR’S END,  
BUT THERE’S SO MUCH TO LOVE ABOUT BOTH SEASONS. CRISP FALL WEATHER, WITH ITS  
NOSTALGIC SCENT OF FALLING LEAVES, GIVES WAY TO WINTER’S SHARP , BRACING CHILL—
AND TO THE HOLIDAYS, WITH THEIR PARADE OF PARTIES AND DELICIOUS FOOD AND DRINKS.   
THERE’S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT: THE COOLER MONTHS ARE JUST THE RIGHT TIME TO ENJOY  
WELL-MADE COCKTAILS—ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT CAN WARM YOU FROM THE INSIDE OUT.  H ealing, warming drinks are wonderful remedies for the deep-down kind of cold that really 
gets into your bones. Apothecaries of old would have had a thorough knowledge of the effects 
of cold weather upon the body—and they’d have been well versed in how to treat those effects. 
In chilly climates, of course, it’s not just the low temperatures that make the cold difficult to bear; 
it’s also the lack of sunlight, which makes winter days nearly as dark as winter nights, and can lead 
to sluggishness and sinking spirits. It’s not surprising, then, that the pharmacies in Scandinavian 
countries, for instance, carry many varieties of herbal elixirs, bitters, and tonics—many of them are 
based on special combinations of botanicals that are specifically designed to warm the body from 
within. Some of these elixirs can be combined with liquids that are already hot, such as strong, black 
tea or homemade soups for double the chill-fighting power. 
 And, as early pharmacists knew well, a single cure can treat a range of maladies—which is why 
the ingredients in these warming winter cocktails do more than just counteract the cold. Citrus fruits 
and their juices, for example, are powerful assets to the immune system, as sailors of days gone by 
would have known: without precious vitamin C, sailors would have been subject to life-threatening 
diseases such as scurvy. (Cranberries, too, pack a wallop of vitamin C as well as antioxidants.) The 
warming taste and fragrance of cardamom is wonderful in wintry desserts—have you ever tried it in 
a chocolate tart?—but it’s also said to be an effective antidote to nausea and other tummy troubles. 
Plus, tasty, frost-battling winter warmers need not be highly alcoholic in order to banish the chills, so 
go ahead and amend the amount of alcohol in them if you like. 
 The drinks in this chapter have been created to thaw shivery bodies, and to revive tired, numbed 
spirits. So, if you’re looking for an enlivening aperitif before a mid-fall feast, try a Rye and Cider 
Mulligatawny Cocktail: in it, rye whiskey and hard apple cider partner up before getting pepped 
up by warming curried bitters. Or, if extra-strength healing is what you’re looking for, reach for a 
ration of citrusy Navy Grog: its combination of rum, citrus, and tea far exceeds the sum of its parts. 
If you’re in the mood for a drink that’s refreshing and warming all at once, make a Cardamom 
and Rum Elixir, which features a cardamom-laced simple syrup, rum, and a hit of fizzy water. And 
you’ve got to try my spice-laden “Cranberry Sauce” shrub: sweet, tart, and fragrant, it’s a great 
match for all kinds of whiskies.  
 So, if the temperature’s headed south, you’re battling the sniffles—again—and the weather outside 
is frightful, take heart: The delicious, soothing handmade cocktails in this chapter are sure to warm 
you right down to your toes.HANDMADE DRINKS TO WARM

(Text)WITH THEIR SHORT DAYS AND LONG NIGHTS, AUTUMN AND WINTER HERALD THE YEAR’S END,  
BUT THERE’S SO MUCH TO LOVE ABOUT BOTH SEASONS. CRISP FALL WEATHER, WITH ITS  
NOSTALGIC SCENT OF FALLING LEAVES, GIVES WAY TO WINTER’S SHARP , BRACING CHILL—
AND TO THE HOLIDAYS, WITH THEIR PARADE OF PARTIES AND DELICIOUS FOOD AND DRINKS.   
THERE’S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT: THE COOLER MONTHS ARE JUST THE RIGHT TIME TO ENJOY  
WELL-MADE COCKTAILS—ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT CAN WARM YOU FROM THE INSIDE OUT.  H ealing, warming drinks are wonderful remedies for the deep-down kind of cold that really 
gets into your bones. Apothecaries of old would have had a thorough knowledge of the effects 
of cold weather upon the body—and they’d have been well versed in how to treat those effects. 
In chilly climates, of course, it’s not just the low temperatures that make the cold difficult to bear; 
it’s also the lack of sunlight, which makes winter days nearly as dark as winter nights, and can lead 
to sluggishness and sinking spirits. It’s not surprising, then, that the pharmacies in Scandinavian 
countries, for instance, carry many varieties of herbal elixirs, bitters, and tonics—many of them are 
based on special combinations of botanicals that are specifically designed to warm the body from 
within. Some of these elixirs can be combined with liquids that are already hot, such as strong, black 
tea or homemade soups for double the chill-fighting power. 
 And, as early pharmacists knew well, a single cure can treat a range of maladies—which is why 
the ingredients in these warming winter cocktails do more than just counteract the cold. Citrus fruits 
and their juices, for example, are powerful assets to the immune system, as sailors of days gone by 
would have known: without precious vitamin C, sailors would have been subject to life-threatening 
diseases such as scurvy. (Cranberries, too, pack a wallop of vitamin C as well as antioxidants.) The 
warming taste and fragrance of cardamom is wonderful in wintry desserts—have you ever tried it in 
a chocolate tart?—but it’s also said to be an effective antidote to nausea and other tummy troubles. 
Plus, tasty, frost-battling winter warmers need not be highly alcoholic in order to banish the chills, so 
go ahead and amend the amount of alcohol in them if you like. 
 The drinks in this chapter have been created to thaw shivery bodies, and to revive tired, numbed 
spirits. So, if you’re looking for an enlivening aperitif before a mid-fall feast, try a Rye and Cider 
Mulligatawny Cocktail: in it, rye whiskey and hard apple cider partner up before getting pepped 
up by warming curried bitters. Or, if extra-strength healing is what you’re looking for, reach for a 
ration of citrusy Navy Grog: its combination of rum, citrus, and tea far exceeds the sum of its parts.

(Text)In America’s early days, apples were an important autumn crop for the Northeastern states, and 
whiskey—usually rye whiskey—was the only tipple available to the average drinker. Rye whiskey 
would have been added to apple cider to give it a bit of kick, a combination that lives on in this 
cocktail. As usual, though, there’s a twist: Curried bitters (or, in a pinch, curry powder added to 
“regular” aromatic bitters) is a tip of the hat to a warm, spicy bowl of mulligatawny stew, which 
features both apples and curry. Sound weird? Don’t worry: It isn’t. Dry, spicy rye is the perfect foil to sweet apples—and the curried bitters bind it all together beautifully. Makes an animating 
late-autumn aperitif.

(Text)PROFESSOR MEIKLEJOHN’S PINKY   CARDAMOM AND RUM ELIXIR 
Named for a professor made famous for his relationship with the writer Robert Louis Stevenson, 
this rye whiskey–based cold-weather cocktail is sure to restore and inspire. And the best part: It’s 
really easy to prepare. Whip up a batch of the Best Hot Chocolate so it can play host to organic 
root tea liqueur, rye, and—since this drink really has a flair for the dramatic—a pinch of cayenne 
pepper. It’s a very grown-up version of every kid’s favorite wintertime treat. Serve after dinner 
alongside a plateful of simple, buttery cookies, like homemade madeleines. Oh, and be sure to 
preheat your mug with boiling water beforehand to ensure that your Pinky stays toasty warm. In this invigorating cocktail, the warming, purifying spice cardamom is steeped in simple syrup and 
combined with cane-sugar rum before it’s bathed in fizzy water for a flavorful, powerful curative 
that’s as tasty as it is healing. It’s sure to boost the spirits and brush the cobwebs away. Treat 
yourself to a Cardamom and Rum Elixir when you’re recovering from a pesky midwinter cold.

Combine the rum and cardamom simple syrup in a Boston

let the ice melt into the cocktail. By the time your glass is 
empty, that melancholy mood will be ancient history. r.)
Curative cardamom. A member of the ginger family, cardamom is 
frequently used in Asian cuisine, and it also appears regularly in Ayurvedic 
preparations and traditional Chinese medicine. It promotes the flow of chi, 
or life-energy, which means it’s warming and invigorating, and it’s reputed 
to help the kidneys rid the body of harmful impurities. Cardamom is also 
said to stimulate the nervous system, reduce inflammation, and to act as 
an expectorant. Early pharmacists in America would have used cardamom 
and other exotic spices extensively (if they could get them) when treating 
patients with stubborn flu symptoms—not least because cardamom is meant to aid all sorts of digestive disorders, like nausea, bloating, gas, and 
lots more. SIDENOTE

(Text)PROFESSOR MEIKLEJOHN’S PINKY   CARDAMOM AND RUM ELIXIR 
Named for a professor made famous for his relationship with the writer Robert Louis Stevenson, 
this rye whiskey–based cold-weather cocktail is sure to restore and inspire. And the best part: It’s 
really easy to prepare. Whip up a batch of the Best Hot Chocolate so it can play host to organic 
root tea liqueur, rye, and—since this drink really has a flair for the dramatic—a pinch of cayenne 
pepper. It’s a very grown-up version of every kid’s favorite wintertime treat. Serve after dinner 
alongside a plateful of simple, buttery cookies, like homemade madeleines. Oh, and be sure to 
preheat your mug with boiling water beforehand to ensure that your Pinky stays toasty warm. In this invigorating cocktail, the warming, purifying spice cardamom is steeped in simple syrup and 
combined with cane-sugar rum before it’s bathed in fizzy water for a flavorful, powerful curative 
that’s as tasty as it is healing. It’s sure to boost the spirits and brush the cobwebs away. Treat 
yourself to a Cardamom and Rum Elixir when you’re recovering from a pesky midwinter cold.  
_ 1 OUNCE (30 ML) RYE WHISKEY
_ 1/2 OUNCE (15 ML) ORGANIC  
ROOT TEA LIQUEUR
_ 3 OUNCES (90 ML) BEST HOT

_ 1/2 OUNCE (15 ML) CARDAMOM  
SIMPLE SYRUP (SEE PAGE 311)
_ 4 OUNCES (120 ML) SELTZER WATER_ 2 DASHES ANGOSTURA BITTERSINGREDIENTSINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Combine the rum and cardamom simple syrup in a Boston 
shaker filled three-quarters full with ice. Shake until combined 
and chilled (about fifteen seconds). Place one ice cube in a 
short rocks glass; then strain the mixture over the ice. Top 
with the seltzer water and add the bitters. Sip slowly, and 
let the ice melt into the cocktail. By the time your glass is 
empty, that melancholy mood will be ancient history. r.)
Curative cardamom. A member of the ginger family, cardamom is 
frequently used in Asian cuisine, and it also appears regularly in Ayurvedic 
preparations and traditional Chinese medicine. It promotes the flow of chi, 
or life-energy, which means it’s warming and invigorating, and it’s reputed 
to help the kidneys rid the body of harmful impurities. Cardamom is also 
said to stimulate the nervous system, reduce inflammation, and to act as 
an expectorant. Early pharmacists in America would have used cardamom 
and other exotic spices extensively (if they could get them) when treating 
patients with stubborn flu symptoms—not least because cardamom is meant to aid all sorts of digestive disorders, like nausea, bloating, gas, and 
lots more. SIDENOTE

(Text)When you sit down to Thanksgiving dinner, do you lunge for the big cut-glass bowl of tart, tex-
tured, homemade cranberry sauce? If your answer is yes, then this easy-to-make shrub’s right up 
your alley. It’s a distilled version of that classic New England dish, and it’s redolent of cinnamon, 
citrus, and wintery baking spices that smell just like Christmas. 
_ 1 CUP (110 G) CRANBERRIES,  
LIGHTLY CRUSHED  
_ 1 CUP (200 G) DEMERARA SUGAR
_ 1 CINNAMON STICK_ ZEST OF 1/2 AN ORANGE  
_ 1/2 TEASPOON FRESHLY GRATED NUTMEG_ 1/2 TEASPOON GROUND CLOVES_ 1 CUP (235 ML) RED WINE VINEGAR  INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Time: 2 weeks. Combine the cranberries and spices with the sugar 
in a nonreactive bowl, and stir well to combine. Cover tightly, and let 
the mixture sit at cellar or fridge temperature for at least 2 days, mix-
ing several times per day to combine the flavors. Then, pour the vinegar 
over the cranberry mixture and let it sit for 1 week at cellar or fridge 
temperature. Now, place a sieve over another nonreactive bowl, and 
transfer the mixture to the sieve. Use a wooden spoon to press as much 
of the rich liquid through the sieve as possible. Discard the fruit pulp. 
Funnel the mixture into sterilized bottles or jars, and age the shrub 
at fridge or cellar temperature for another week or so before you use it. 
Use your shrub in my Cocktail Whisperer’s twist on the classic Rob Roy.“CRANBERRY SAUCE” SHRUB
Cranberries: a seventeenth-century superfood. There’s 
a reason pharmacists of yore would have gone to great lengths to preserve 
cranberries—also known as “bearberries” back in the day—in their medic-
inal shrubs. (And it’s not because they’re such a great match for turkey.) 
Cranberries are one of the original American superfoods, and early settlers 
knew it. Jam-packed with vitamin C, they’d have helped to prevent scurvy: 
plus, they have plenty of antioxidants, dietary fiber, and a hefty helping of 
manganese, a valuable dietary mineral. They’re also said to help boost the 
immune system, lower blood pressure, and treat urinary tract infections, 
and they may even promote dental health since they prevent plaque from adhering to teeth. And cranberries weren’t just useful in the kitchen, either: 
Thanks to their trademark scarlet hue, colonial settlers also used them to 
dye clothing.  SIDENOTE

(Text)My grandfather was very fond of Rob Roys. He’d make them with Dewar’s White Label Scotch—
and that’s how I knew he thought of them as a special treat, since the only spirit I’d ever seen in 
his house was bourbon whiskey. I’m not a big Scotch drinker myself, but even I have to admit 
that the Rob Roy is a woefully underrated cocktail. It’s very similar to a Manhattan, only it’s 
made with Scotch whisky instead of bourbon or rye—and it’s got all the stuffing to stimulate your 
appetite, which makes it both a powerful aperitif and an effective digestif. So what’s my Cocktail 
Whisperer’s twist on the classic recipe? Well, I’ve added a portion of my fragrant Cranberry Sauce 
Shrub to the mix, since Scotch and the perky, crisp shrub are a naturally delicious pair. Try one 
before Christmas dinner. 
_ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) SCOTCH WHISKY
_ 1 OUNCE (30 ML) CRANBERRY SAUCE  
SHRUB (SEE PAGE 126–127)
_ 1/4 OUNCE (7 ML) SWEET VERMOUTH,  
SUCH AS CARPANO ANTICA
_ 4 DROPS ORANGE BITTERS      INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Fill a cocktail mixing glass half full with ice. Add the Scotch, the 
Cranberry Sauce Shrub, and the Carpano Antica. Stir gently, and 
then strain the mixture into a coupe glass. Dot the orange bitters 
over the top to finish—and lift your hat to Roy as you sip.ROB’S SONNY, ROY

his house was bourbon whiskey. I’m not a big Scotch drinker myself, but even I have to admit 
that the Rob Roy is a woefully underrated cocktail. It’s very similar to a Manhattan, only it’s 
made with Scotch whisky instead of bourbon or rye—and it’s got all the stuffing to stimulate your 
appetite, which makes it both a powerful aperitif and an effective digestif. So what’s my Cocktail 
Whisperer’s twist on the classic recipe? Well, I’ve added a portion of my fragrant Cranberry Sauce 
Shrub to the mix, since Scotch and the perky, crisp shrub are a naturally delicious pair. Try one 
before Christmas dinner. 
_ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) SCOTCH WHISKY
_ 1 OUNCE (30 ML) CRANBERRY SAUCE  
SHRUB (SEE PAGE 126–127)
_ 1/4 OUNCE (7 ML) SWEET VERMOUTH,  
SUCH AS CARPANO ANTICA
_ 4 DROPS ORANGE BITTERS      INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Fill a cocktail mixing glass half full with ice. Add the Scotch, the 
Cranberry Sauce Shrub, and the Carpano Antica. Stir gently, and 
then strain the mixture into a coupe glass. Dot the orange bitters 
over the top to finish—and lift your hat to Roy as you sip.ROB’S SONNY, ROY

(Text)PACKING THE OLD PICKUP TRUCK CENTERBA AND CHOCOLATE CHAUD 
This memorable, white whiskey–laden cocktail was inspired by the quince fruit grown on my 
family’s farm. A late-season fruit that’s usually ripe by November, quince looks like the offspring 
of an apple and a pear, and it’s a bright lemon yellow. When roasted, it’s absolutely sublime: It has 
a faint citrus flavor, and it’s tinged with the restrained elegance of light stone fruits. After spending 
some time in a hot oven, the natural sugars in the quince ooze out, and it becomes a wonderful 
addition to cocktails like the Old Pickup Truck. You can find quince in specialty food shops or, 
in season, at your local farmer’s market—but feel free to use store-bought quince paste instead. 
Combined with raki (a strong Turkish aniseed liqueur), club soda, and a hint of orange flower 
water, this cocktail is sophisticated and exotic, all at once. The spicy, potent liqueur Centerba, distilled from over a hundred wild, aromatic (but top-secret) 
botanicals, hails from northern Italy, a region with a rich history of creating and enjoying herbal 
Alpine elixirs. It’s got a slightly acerbic edge, but never fear: This hot, boozy chill-chaser made with 
classic hot chocolate—chaud means “hot” in French—takes the edge off its bite.

_ 1 OUNCE (30 ML) RAKI

SLOWLY, DO NOT BOIL, AND WHISK  
CONSTANTLY UNTIL SMOOTH.)
_ SUGAR OR HONEY, TO TASTE (OPTIONAL)
_ FRESHLY MADE WHIPPED  
CREAM (SEE SIDENOTE)INGREDIENTSINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Preheat two mugs by filling them with boiling water; discard 
the water after a few seconds. Add 11/2 ounces (45 ml) Centerba 
to each mug;  pour half the hot chocolate over the Centerba in 
each mug. (Add a little sugar or honey to taste, if necessary.) 
Spoon the fresh whipped cream over the top—then relax, 
indulge, and sip until you’re thoroughly thawed. Serves 2. 
Homemade whipped cream in minutes. Put down that 
aerosol can right now. You don’t need to buy pre-made, processed, preser -
vative-laden whipped cream from the supermarket! It’s ridiculously easy to 
make your own, and it tastes so much better than the store-bought stuff. 
Just add 1 cup heavy whipping cream and 2 tablespoons sugar (or more or 
less, to taste), plus 1/2-1 teaspoon vanilla extract, if you like, to a medium 
bowl, then use an electric mixer to whip the mixture until soft peaks form 
(about 4-5 minutes). Do not overwhip, or the mixture may become lumpy. 
Use it to top your Centerba and Chocolate Chaud—or  a round of Irish 
coffees!—then store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator 
for 1-2 days. SIDENOTE

(Text)GENERAL JACK’S CRISP APPLE FIZZ 
This cocktail celebrates those late September days when the sunlight becomes syrupy and 
mellow, the air takes on that bracing, autumnal crackle, and apple trees yield their generous 
bounty. Out here in western New Jersey, we’re blessed with trees that produce gorgeous cider 
apples, and cider—and all things that smack of apple, really—is a great match for the smoky 
flavor inherent to Tennessee sipping whiskey. Here, whiskey, apple brandy, and apple cider are 
rounded out with a homemade honey simple syrup and doused with seltzer water just prior to 
serving for a drink that’s the essence of fall. Plus, when you mix Tennessee sipping whiskey with 
apple cider, magical things happen: The world takes on a lovely golden hue, and troubles seem 
just a bit further away.

that’s produced in the state of Tennessee, and was traditionally made to 
be sipped slowly (instead of thrown back as a shot or diluted with mixers). 
Jack Daniel’s is probably the best-known producer of Tennessee sipping 
whiskey. Their distinctive, black-labeled bottles appear in bars (and in 
private homes) all over the world, even in the smallest of villages. The Jack 
Daniel’s proprietary method of distillation involves deep charcoal filtration: 
Towards the end of the production process, the whiskey is filtered through 
charcoal in wooden vats. This charred-wood filtration creates JD’s trade-
mark smoky flavor, and balances the naturally sweet flavor of corn, its main 
ingredient. It’s a flavor that’s unique to Tennessee whiskeys; bourbon whis-
keys produced elsewhere in the United States don’t possess this smokiness 
because they’re not filtered through charcoal. If you enjoy Scotch whiskey, 
try a Tennessee sipping whiskey: Stylistically, they’re very similar due to their smoky flavor. That said, traditional distillation laws in the state are 
changing, and not all Tennessee whiskey is as smoky in the nose and mouth 
as Jack Daniel’s is (whose Black Label, in particular, is not for the faint of 
heart!). Craft liquor producers are now seeking new licenses that’ll permit 
them to produce their own versions of Tennessee sipping whiskey, using the 
state’s locally drawn, fragrant, mineral-packed water. SIDENOTECOOL-WEATHER COCKTAILS •

(Text)GENERAL JACK’S CRISP APPLE FIZZ 
This cocktail celebrates those late September days when the sunlight becomes syrupy and 
mellow, the air takes on that bracing, autumnal crackle, and apple trees yield their generous 
bounty. Out here in western New Jersey, we’re blessed with trees that produce gorgeous cider 
apples, and cider—and all things that smack of apple, really—is a great match for the smoky 
flavor inherent to Tennessee sipping whiskey. Here, whiskey, apple brandy, and apple cider are 
rounded out with a homemade honey simple syrup and doused with seltzer water just prior to 
serving for a drink that’s the essence of fall. Plus, when you mix Tennessee sipping whiskey with 
apple cider, magical things happen: The world takes on a lovely golden hue, and troubles seem 
just a bit further away.  
Fill a Boston shaker three-quarters full with ice. Add the 
Tennessee sipping whiskey, the apple brandy, the apple cider, 
and the Honey Simple Syrup. Shake like crazy for about 20 
seconds. Pour over hand-cut ice in a tall Collins glass. Top with 
the seltzer, garnish with the grapefruit zest twist, and serve.Tennessee sipping whiskey lives up to its name. It’s whiskey 
that’s produced in the state of Tennessee, and was traditionally made to 
be sipped slowly (instead of thrown back as a shot or diluted with mixers). 
Jack Daniel’s is probably the best-known producer of Tennessee sipping 
whiskey. Their distinctive, black-labeled bottles appear in bars (and in 
private homes) all over the world, even in the smallest of villages. The Jack 
Daniel’s proprietary method of distillation involves deep charcoal filtration: 
Towards the end of the production process, the whiskey is filtered through 
charcoal in wooden vats. This charred-wood filtration creates JD’s trade-
mark smoky flavor, and balances the naturally sweet flavor of corn, its main 
ingredient. It’s a flavor that’s unique to Tennessee whiskeys; bourbon whis-
keys produced elsewhere in the United States don’t possess this smokiness 
because they’re not filtered through charcoal. If you enjoy Scotch whiskey, 
try a Tennessee sipping whiskey: Stylistically, they’re very similar due to their smoky flavor. That said, traditional distillation laws in the state are 
changing, and not all Tennessee whiskey is as smoky in the nose and mouth 
as Jack Daniel’s is (whose Black Label, in particular, is not for the faint of 
heart!). Craft liquor producers are now seeking new licenses that’ll permit 
them to produce their own versions of Tennessee sipping whiskey, using the 
state’s locally drawn, fragrant, mineral-packed water. SIDENOTECOOL-WEATHER COCKTAILS •

(Text)Here’s another sumptuous quick shrub for those of you who crave instant gratification—and it’s a 
combination that works so well in autumnal cocktails. My Quick Balsamic-Fig Shrub calls upon 
flavors you already know and love: Who hasn’t enjoyed a salad of figs (and, perhaps, arugula) driz-
zled with good-quality balsamic? There’s a reason it’s such a good match: Fresh figs, with their 
sweet funkiness, are a great foil for tart, viscous balsamic vinegar. And capturing their essences in 
a shrub means instant success when it comes to making cocktails. This shrub would be wonderful 
in bourbon- or rye whiskey-based cocktails, but using booze is completely optional: You could 
also skip the liquor completely, and mix it with nothing more than a little soda water and a dash 
of simple syrup, as in the sublimely named Lady Frazier’s Harried Excuse (see page 136–137).
_ 4–5 PLUMP FRESH FIGS, QUARTERED
_ 1 CUP (200 G) DEMERARA SUGAR_ 1 CUP (235 ML) BALSAMIC VINEGAR
 INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Place the fig quarters in a nonreactive bowl, and cover them with the 
sugar. Add the vinegar immediately, and mix well. Cover tightly, and 
let the mixture sit on the countertop for 2–3 days. Then, uncover the 
fig mixture, and mash it up a bit with a fork. Place a strainer over 
another nonreactive bowl, and transfer the mixture to the strainer. 
Press down on the fruit mixture with a wooden spoon to squeeze out 
as much liquid as possible. Voila: a shrub is born. Store the mixture in 
a sterilized bottle or jar, and use in your mock-or cocktails immediately. QUICK BALSAMIC-FIG SHRUB

(Text)NAVY GROG A QUARTER APIECE COCKTAIL
Today, we know how important vitamin C is to a healthy immune system, especially during the 
winter months when colds and flu run rampant. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, 
sailors and ship doctors discovered that citrus fruits could combat scurvy, a disease that afflicted 
many sailors due to the lack of vitamin C in their diets. Soon afterwards, citrus juices and extracts 
were added to sailors’ daily rations of rum and water—a combination called “grog.”  If a sailor 
took ill, a hot, restorative tea might have been added to his regimen of rum, citrus juice, and 
water. Rum—or “kill-devil,” as it was called—has been used as a curative for centuries, and the 
triumvirate of tea, lemon, and rum was said to relieve fevers and stomach maladies. Easy-to-make 
and satisfying, hot grog is still delicious today—for “medicinal” uses only, of course.  Thanks to the natural astringency of the quince fruit, rye whiskey and quince is a delicious (and 
highly effective) pairing. The only way to improve upon it is to smoke fresh sage into your Boston 
shaker: It gently perfumes the Quarter Apiece with an inimitable, savory-charred scent.

_ 1/2 OUNCE (15 ML) CLUB SODA_ SEVERAL DASHES RHUBARB BITTERS  INGREDIENTSINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Pre-chill a martini glass by filling it with crushed ice and 
cold water, and then pour the ice water out. Place the sage in 
a fireproof metal or ceramic bowl. Using a match or lighter, 
carefully set the sage on fire so that it smokes and smolders. Take 
a Boston shaker and hold it upside down over the burning 
sage, so that the shaker’s interior is filled with the sweet, sticky 
smoke. Turn the shaker right-side up, and add the rye whiskey, 
the gin, and the apple juice. Then, fill the shaker three-quarters 
full with ice, add the quince puree, and shake for about 20 
seconds. Pour the mixture into the martini glass, top with the 
club soda, and finish with a few dashes of rhubarb bitters.
Smoking permitted. But only in the name of mixology, of course. 
Smoking your fresh herbs before using them—or just their smoke, as in 
the Quarter Apiece—in cocktails can add a toasty, earthy, mysterious note 
to your handmade drinks.  And you don’t need any specialized equipment to do it, either. The Quarter Apiece calls for sage, but you can smoke or 
char other woody herbs, too. Apply the same method to capture the smoke 
from, say, rosemary, thyme, or even a cinnamon stick, and use it in your 
cocktails—especially ones with spirits like rum, whiskey, tequila, or mezcal. 
Just don’t forget to use a fireproof bowl! SIDENOTE

full with ice, add the quince puree, and shake for about 20 
seconds. Pour the mixture into the martini glass, top with the 
club soda, and finish with a few dashes of rhubarb bitters.
Smoking permitted. But only in the name of mixology, of course. 
Smoking your fresh herbs before using them—or just their smoke, as in 
the Quarter Apiece—in cocktails can add a toasty, earthy, mysterious note 
to your handmade drinks.  And you don’t need any specialized equipment to do it, either. The Quarter Apiece calls for sage, but you can smoke or 
char other woody herbs, too. Apply the same method to capture the smoke 
from, say, rosemary, thyme, or even a cinnamon stick, and use it in your 
cocktails—especially ones with spirits like rum, whiskey, tequila, or mezcal. 
Just don’t forget to use a fireproof bowl! COOL-WEATHER COCKTAILS •

(Text)NAVY GROG A QUARTER APIECE COCKTAIL
Today, we know how important vitamin C is to a healthy immune system, especially during the 
winter months when colds and flu run rampant. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, 
sailors and ship doctors discovered that citrus fruits could combat scurvy, a disease that afflicted 
many sailors due to the lack of vitamin C in their diets. Soon afterwards, citrus juices and extracts 
were added to sailors’ daily rations of rum and water—a combination called “grog.”  If a sailor 
took ill, a hot, restorative tea might have been added to his regimen of rum, citrus juice, and 
water. Rum—or “kill-devil,” as it was called—has been used as a curative for centuries, and the 
triumvirate of tea, lemon, and rum was said to relieve fevers and stomach maladies. Easy-to-make 
and satisfying, hot grog is still delicious today—for “medicinal” uses only, of course.  Thanks to the natural astringency of the quince fruit, rye whiskey and quince is a delicious (and 
highly effective) pairing. The only way to improve upon it is to smoke fresh sage into your Boston 
shaker: It gently perfumes the Quarter Apiece with an inimitable, savory-charred scent.

Pre-chill a martini glass by filling it with crushed ice and 
cold water, and then pour the ice water out. Place the sage in 
a fireproof metal or ceramic bowl. Using a match or lighter, 
carefully set the sage on fire so that it smokes and smolders. Take 
a Boston shaker and hold it upside down over the burning 
sage, so that the shaker’s interior is filled with the sweet, sticky 
smoke. Turn the shaker right-side up, and add the rye whiskey, 
the gin, and the apple juice. Then, fill the shaker three-quarters

Prepare the tea in a teapot. Add 3 (90 ml) ounces each

(Text)Traditionally, an Old-Fashioned involves muddling sugar and bitters in the bottom of a glass, 
then adding a citrus twist and blended whiskey. Minimalist, delicious, and very Mad Men! But 
my Cocktail Whisperer’s take on this classic transforms it into a warming winter drink that’s 
a lovechild of the Old-Fashioned and a hot toddy. It replaces the sugar with grilled fruit, the 
citrus with grilled orange, and the regular ol’ whiskey with Tennessee sipping whiskey. And hot 
tea, steaming apple cider, and raw honey make it just the thing for kicking back by the fire. I 
recommend grilling both the apples and oranges, since it gives the drink a toastiness that can’t 
be beat. The Hot Apple Pie Old-Fashioned will warm your hands—and the cockles of your 
heart—on even the wintriest of days.

(Text)One of my favorite winter warmers hails from Scotland, where the Scots “correct” a steaming 
mug of rich lamb broth with a famous barley-based digestive called—you guessed it—Scotch 
whisky. Piping-hot Scotch broth is practically a full meal, being packed with lamb, carrots, celery, 
and onions, and interwoven with lashings of smoky Scotch whisky. (Try to make your own lamb 
stock for your Scotch broth, since it’s so much better than the store-bought stuff.) Like its distant 
cousin borscht, this fine corrective warms the body, calms the mind, and soothes the spirit—even 
on the icy winter months when the cold seems to seep into your bones. Can it cure cold-weather 
maladies? Well, as the Scottish proverb goes, “Whiskey may not cure the common cold, but it fails 
more agreeably than most things.”

(Text)This savory, root-vegetable-based shrub is the very essence of autumn. Lightly seasoned with 
fresh sage and tarragon, its flavors are subtle and delicate, and patience is one of its main ingredi-
ents. Don’t try to rush things here: The vegetables in my Parsnip, Carrot, and Fennel Shrub need 
to be chopped finely, and once in situ in their sugar-vinegar bath they do take several weeks to 
ferment—but it’s all worth it in the end. Once it’s ready to use, you can partner it with lightly 
sweetened lemonade. Or, if you feel like adding something a little stronger, know that this shrub 
is marvelous with gin, or even with a healthy hit of aquavit, the infamous Norwegian caraway 
seed–based liquor.
_ 3–4 CUPS (435–580 G) PARSNIPS,  
CARROTS, AND FENNEL BULB CUT  
INTO SMALL COINS OR CHUNKS
_ 2 CUPS (400 G) DEMERARA SUGAR
_ 2 CUPS (475 ML) RED WINE VINEGAR_ 4 LEAVES FRESH TARRAGON_ 4 LEAVES FRESH SAGE_ 1 TEASPOON FRESHLY GRATED NUTMEGINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Time: 2-3 weeks. Place the chopped vegetables in a wide glass bowl, 
cover them with the sugar, and mix well. Cover the mixture, and 
let it sit at cellar temperature for 2–3 days. Now add the red wine 
vinegar, the herbs, and the nutmeg, and mix again. Continue to let 
the mixture ferment at cellar temperature, stirring each day until the 
sugar is dissolved, and adding a little more vinegar if necessary. After 
2–3 weeks, place a strainer over a nonreactive bowl, and transfer 
the mixture to the strainer. Use a wooden spoon to press as much of 
the vegetable mixture through the strainer as possible. Funnel into 
sterilized bottles or jars and store them in the fridge for several more 
weeks, shaking the bottles daily to combine and mellow the flavors. PARSNIP, CARROT, AND FENNEL SHRUB

(Text)Named for a larger-than-life rabble-rouser, saloon owner, and criminal (Tony Soprano had 
nothing on him), this intriguing libation doesn’t include hooch—and that’s because it doesn’t need any. (Unlike Allen himself, of course, who was partial to the stuff.) There’s plenty of flavor 
in this booze-free cocktail, thanks to my Parsnip, Carrot, and Fennel Shrub: After aging for a few 
weeks, the parsnips’ sweetness becomes more pronounced, and aromatic herbs like tarragon and 
sage, combined with the licorice-tinged fennel root, imbue it with subtle layers of flavor. A little 
lemonade and a pinch of sea salt add flavor and texture—and act as a melancholy tip-of-the-hat 
to the fading summer. If you ask me, mocktails made with root-vegetable-based shrubs are espe-
cially beguiling on late fall afternoons, when dusk falls early over bare trees. Go ahead and add 
gin here if you want to kick it Theodore Allen–style—but it’s just as good sans liquor, if not better.

(Text)And now for something completely different. See, I lived in southern Maine after college, and I 
have delicious memories of the scent of maple wood smoke, which seemed to infiltrate everything 
during the long winters. Same with sticky-sweet maple syrup: No matter what I do, I just can’t 
forget the deep, caramelized aromatics of boiled sap. What if those woody, maply scents could 
be turned into a cocktail? Like the Quarter Apiece Cocktail on page 138, this drink involves 
some minor pyrotechnics: It asks you to make your own smoke by lighting up a few splinters of 
maple wood, and then to “wash” a cocktail shaker with a few wisps of that enchanting fragrance. 
(Proceed carefully.) That, plus the mysterious qualities of both absinthe and Tennessee sipping 
whiskey, makes this unique take on the classic Sazerac truly captivating.

DIRECTIONS
Pre-chill your cocktail glass by filling it with ice, cold water, and the Herbsaint or absinthe. Then pour the 
mixture out (consider drinking it—why waste fine spirits?) Using matches or a lighter, carefully light 
the pieces of maple wood so that they kindle and smolder, producing smoke. Hold a Boston shaker over the 
miniature fire, letting the sweet wood smoke gather inside. Then, fill the Boston shaker three-quarters full 
with ice. Add the Tennessee sipping whiskey, then the maple syrup. To the cocktail glass, now chilled and 
tinged by Herbsaint or absinthe, add several dashes of Peychaud’s bitters. Finally, strain the maple smoke 
Sazerac into the cocktail glass, top with the club soda, and garnish with the orange peel zest, twisting it 
slightly to release the fragrant orange oils from the skin. Sip—and start making another immediately.MAPLE SMOKE FIZZ

                       0850 - Craft Cocktail Compendium_int.indd   148 1/13/17   2:19 PMAnd now for something completely different. See, I lived in southern Maine after college, and I 
have delicious memories of the scent of maple wood smoke, which seemed to infiltrate everything 
during the long winters. Same with sticky-sweet maple syrup: No matter what I do, I just can’t 
forget the deep, caramelized aromatics of boiled sap. What if those woody, maply scents could 
be turned into a cocktail? Like the Quarter Apiece Cocktail on page 138, this drink involves 
some minor pyrotechnics: It asks you to make your own smoke by lighting up a few splinters of 
maple wood, and then to “wash” a cocktail shaker with a few wisps of that enchanting fragrance. 
(Proceed carefully.) That, plus the mysterious qualities of both absinthe and Tennessee sipping 
whiskey, makes this unique take on the classic Sazerac truly captivating.  
Pre-chill your cocktail glass by filling it with ice, cold water, and the Herbsaint or absinthe. Then pour the 
mixture out (consider drinking it—why waste fine spirits?) Using matches or a lighter, carefully light 
the pieces of maple wood so that they kindle and smolder, producing smoke. Hold a Boston shaker over the 
miniature fire, letting the sweet wood smoke gather inside. Then, fill the Boston shaker three-quarters full 
with ice. Add the Tennessee sipping whiskey, then the maple syrup. To the cocktail glass, now chilled and 
tinged by Herbsaint or absinthe, add several dashes of Peychaud’s bitters. Finally, strain the maple smoke 
Sazerac into the cocktail glass, top with the club soda, and garnish with the orange peel zest, twisting it 
slightly to release the fragrant orange oils from the skin. Sip—and start making another immediately.MAPLE SMOKE FIZZ

(Text)MOUNTAIN BODY WARMER MOORS AT NIGHT PUNCH
That world-famous herbal (or sometimes fruit-laced) German concentrate of distilled spirits called 
schnapps delivers rapid inner heating that can counteract the effects of cold and snowy weather. 
Schnapps—which has been around for centuries, and was originally only available from apothecar-
ies—can also offer much-needed relief from the winter colds and coughs that can ravage the throat 
and respiratory system. (As the Russian proverb goes, “Drink a glass of schnapps after your soup 
and you steal a ruble from the doctor.”) Germans mix it with hot tea, honey, and lemon; pour it 
into flasks; and use it to warm both body and mind when outdoors during the chilly months. Mix 
up a pot of this soothing tea before or after heading outdoors in wintertime; you’ll feel refreshed 
by the crisp peppermint aroma, and you’ll stay toasty warm from the inside out.Scotch is the essential ingredient in many hot punches, and with good reason: There’s really no 
better restorative for both body and soul. Scotch works its healing magic not only through its 
soothing-yet-stimulating smoky taste, but also through its scent; a mere sniff of a hot, Scotch-
based cocktail is enough to calm the nerves and warm the bones. If you’ve been roaming England’s 
chilly moors with a heavy tread (or if you just feel like you have), rest assured that this savory 
potion will help you beat the “brrr.” Combining steaming-hot, herb-infused beef bouillon with a 
hearty dose of Scotch and a whack of fresh lemon juice, the Moors at Night Punch was inspired by 
a couple of particularly cold winters I spent on mid-coast Maine during the 1980s.

(SUCH AS PEPPERMINT OR SPEARMINT)
_ 4 OUNCES (120 ML)  
PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS
_ 4 OUNCES (120 ML) APRICOT SCHNAPPS
_ 4 TABLESPOONS (80 G)

_ JUICE OF 3 LEMONS_ 1 CUP (235 ML) VERY HOT, STRONG  
BEEF BOUILLON (SEE BELOW)
_ ASSORTED HERBS FROM THE

_ 3 OUNCES (90 ML) SMOKY  
SCOTCH WHISKY  
_ 2 TABLESPOONS (30 ML) RAW HONEY  
SIMPLE SYRUP (SEE PAGE 312-313)
_ 1 OUNCE (30 ML) FRESHLY  
SQUEEZED LEMON JUICE (NO  
SCURVY ABOARD THIS SHIP!)INGREDIENTSINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Place the pre-made bouillon in a small saucepan. Place the 
herbs in a cheesecloth bag, and steep them in the hot bouillon 
for about five minutes. Preheat a ceramic mug by pouring 
boiling water into it, and then pour the water out. Add the 
whisky and Raw Honey Simple Syrup to the mug, and then 
pour the herb-steeped bouillon over the mixture. Finally, 
stir in the fresh lemon juice. Serves 2 frozen souls. 
Homemade beef bouillon is an all-day event, but it’s so worth the 
effort. Here’s my family’s recipe: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Sear 3 
pounds beef bones, 3 pounds oxtail, and 3 pounds shin- and “osso-buco”-
style beef cuts in the oven in a very large sautoir or Dutch Oven. After 1 hour, 
or when the meat is very brown, add 1 pound washed, peeled, and chopped 
root vegetables, like carrots, parsnips, celery, and onion, plus 5-6 halved, 
peeled shallots and 3-4 whole, unpeeled cloves garlic. Turn the heat down if 
it starts to smoke. Scrape up any browned bits, then add a pinch of star anise 
and 1 cup dry white wine. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 
30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then add 1 stalk lemongrass and 2 
gallons spring water. Cover and cook in the oven at 275 degrees (or simmer on the stovetop) for at least 4 hours. Strain out the meat, and reserve for 
another recipe. Reduce the stock to the desired thickness, then cool and use 
in recipes or freeze for up to several months. SIDENOTE

(Text)MOUNTAIN BODY WARMER MOORS AT NIGHT PUNCH
That world-famous herbal (or sometimes fruit-laced) German concentrate of distilled spirits called 
schnapps delivers rapid inner heating that can counteract the effects of cold and snowy weather. 
Schnapps—which has been around for centuries, and was originally only available from apothecar-
ies—can also offer much-needed relief from the winter colds and coughs that can ravage the throat 
and respiratory system. (As the Russian proverb goes, “Drink a glass of schnapps after your soup 
and you steal a ruble from the doctor.”) Germans mix it with hot tea, honey, and lemon; pour it 
into flasks; and use it to warm both body and mind when outdoors during the chilly months. Mix 
up a pot of this soothing tea before or after heading outdoors in wintertime; you’ll feel refreshed 
by the crisp peppermint aroma, and you’ll stay toasty warm from the inside out.Scotch is the essential ingredient in many hot punches, and with good reason: There’s really no 
better restorative for both body and soul. Scotch works its healing magic not only through its 
soothing-yet-stimulating smoky taste, but also through its scent; a mere sniff of a hot, Scotch-
based cocktail is enough to calm the nerves and warm the bones. If you’ve been roaming England’s 
chilly moors with a heavy tread (or if you just feel like you have), rest assured that this savory 
potion will help you beat the “brrr.” Combining steaming-hot, herb-infused beef bouillon with a 
hearty dose of Scotch and a whack of fresh lemon juice, the Moors at Night Punch was inspired by 
a couple of particularly cold winters I spent on mid-coast Maine during the 1980s.

Place the pre-made bouillon in a small saucepan. Place the 
herbs in a cheesecloth bag, and steep them in the hot bouillon 
for about five minutes. Preheat a ceramic mug by pouring 
boiling water into it, and then pour the water out. Add the 
whisky and Raw Honey Simple Syrup to the mug, and then 
pour the herb-steeped bouillon over the mixture. Finally, 
stir in the fresh lemon juice. Serves 2 frozen souls. 
Homemade beef bouillon is an all-day event, but it’s so worth the 
effort. Here’s my family’s recipe: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Sear 3 
pounds beef bones, 3 pounds oxtail, and 3 pounds shin- and “osso-buco”-
style beef cuts in the oven in a very large sautoir or Dutch Oven. After 1 hour, 
or when the meat is very brown, add 1 pound washed, peeled, and chopped 
root vegetables, like carrots, parsnips, celery, and onion, plus 5-6 halved, 
peeled shallots and 3-4 whole, unpeeled cloves garlic. Turn the heat down if 
it starts to smoke. Scrape up any browned bits, then add a pinch of star anise 
and 1 cup dry white wine. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 
30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then add 1 stalk lemongrass and 2 
gallons spring water. Cover and cook in the oven at 275 degrees (or simmer on the stovetop) for at least 4 hours. Strain out the meat, and reserve for 
another recipe. Reduce the stock to the desired thickness, then cool and use 
in recipes or freeze for up to several months. SIDENOTE

(Text)Caraway seeds, which were traditionally used in topical medicinal preparations such salves or 
balms, made their way into the potent Norwegian tipple aquavit, a marvelous caraway- and anise-
scented elixir made from potatoes. Taking its name from the Latin phrase aqua vitae, or “water of 
life,” aquavit is also very popular in northern European countries such as Sweden and Denmark, 
regions in which below-zero weather is status quo during the winter months. Originally invented 
in the sixteenth century as a digestive aid, in the era of the pharmacist and the apothecary, aquavit 
might have been prepared with other medicinal herbs and sweet spices in addition to caraway, in 
order to stave off other cold-weather-induced maladies. It’s especially delicious when served on 
its own alongside platters of smoked fish—or in this healing concoction of aquavit, herb-infused

(Text)HONEY HEALERGINGER-LIME SHRUBB COCKTAIL
In Germany, certain herb-based liqueurs are produced with enzyme-rich honey from the Yucatan 
Peninsula in Mexico in order to offset the liqueurs’ acerbic bitters. This rich, darkly colored 
honey is a great healer: Raw honey has been said to alleviate the symptoms of seasonal allergies 
when consumed regularly, and may be good for digestive ailments like colitis. In Ayurvedic 
medicine, too, honey is highly valued—it’s reputed to be one of the most powerful substances 
for promoting good health in general. And honey can sweeten the spirit as well as the body: Okay, so the Ginger-Lime Shrubb Cocktail isn’t a hot drink, but it’ll warm the cockles of 
your heart nonetheless. Shrubb cocktails are derived from historic maritime cocktail ingredients 
that include vinegar for the preservation of easily spoiled—and valuable—citrus fruits. Without 
preservatives, citrus fruits would have quickly rotted under the hot sun. In traditional Shrubb 
cocktails, lime and ginger supplement honey, vinegar, and cider, packing powerful health benefits. 
They take their inspiration from the concentrated citrus syrups once used to stave off tropical 
diseases that plagued seafarers, such as scurvy. The intense flavors of lime and ginger can act 
as an antidote to seasickness on their own, but they’re especially delicious alongside rum and 
hydrating, refreshing seltzer water—particularly soothing when fighting a body-ravaging cold. _ 12 OUNCES (355 ML) COOL BLACK TEA

(Text)HONEY HEALERGINGER-LIME SHRUBB COCKTAIL
In Germany, certain herb-based liqueurs are produced with enzyme-rich honey from the Yucatan 
Peninsula in Mexico in order to offset the liqueurs’ acerbic bitters. This rich, darkly colored 
honey is a great healer: Raw honey has been said to alleviate the symptoms of seasonal allergies 
when consumed regularly, and may be good for digestive ailments like colitis. In Ayurvedic 
medicine, too, honey is highly valued—it’s reputed to be one of the most powerful substances 
for promoting good health in general. And honey can sweeten the spirit as well as the body: Okay, so the Ginger-Lime Shrubb Cocktail isn’t a hot drink, but it’ll warm the cockles of 
your heart nonetheless. Shrubb cocktails are derived from historic maritime cocktail ingredients 
that include vinegar for the preservation of easily spoiled—and valuable—citrus fruits. Without 
preservatives, citrus fruits would have quickly rotted under the hot sun. In traditional Shrubb 
cocktails, lime and ginger supplement honey, vinegar, and cider, packing powerful health benefits. 
They take their inspiration from the concentrated citrus syrups once used to stave off tropical 
diseases that plagued seafarers, such as scurvy. The intense flavors of lime and ginger can act 
as an antidote to seasickness on their own, but they’re especially delicious alongside rum and 
hydrating, refreshing seltzer water—particularly soothing when fighting a body-ravaging cold. _ 12 OUNCES (355 ML) COOL BLACK TEA

DIRECTIONSPrepare the tea; stir in the honey; and let the mixture 
cool. Pack two glasses with crushed ice, and divide the rum 
and the herbal liqueur between them. Top each glass with 
the honey-sweetened tea. Stir, taste, adjust the sweetness 
if necessary, and say guten Morgen to a great mood. 
Toss a handful of ice cubes into a short rocks glass. Add the 
Rhum Agricole and stir in the ginger-lime Shrubb syrup. Top 
with the seltzer water and a dash or two of stomach-healing 
Angostura bitters, to taste. Sip slowly, letting the bracing 
ginger-lime combination nurse you back to health. Suspending it in alcohol and combining it with black or herbal tea and plenty of ice makes it a 
highly refreshing mood enhancer. The honey, rum, and German herbal spirits in this tall cocktail

Brewing up a strong hot toddy is one of my favorite ways to get rid of a headache, or to put the 
kibosh on a pesky cold. And Scotch makes a top-notch toddy: Combining Scotch with hot water 
or strong black tea enhances its peaty flavor. (I prefer tea, to be honest, since watery toddies 
aren’t up my alley; but if you’re avoiding caffeine, hot water really does work just as well. Or, you 
might try decaffeinated black tea instead.) Scotch, fresh lemon juice, hot black tea, and simple 
syrup combine in the Belle Isle Cocktail for a hot punch that really packs a punch. This gorgeous 
little glug comprises no more than four simple ingredients, but it’s certain to help you shake that 
woolly-headedness that accompanies winter colds and other bugs. Apply as needed.

syrup combine in the Belle Isle Cocktail for a hot punch that really packs a punch. This gorgeous 
little glug comprises no more than four simple ingredients, but it’s certain to help you shake that 
woolly-headedness that accompanies winter colds and other bugs. Apply as needed. 
Preheat your favorite ceramic mug by filling it with boiling 
water, and then pour the water out. Add the simple syrup and 
the Scotch to the mug, followed by the tea and the fresh lemon 
juice. Stir gently. Serve and sip, preferably under a warm quilt. Start your love affair with Scotch. Scotch whisky (note that 
missing “e”!) certainly looms large in the collective memory of drinkers 
around the world, and whether you’re an expert or a neophyte when it 
comes to Scotch, I’ll wager you’re familiar with the tipple, if only in theory. 
So, what is the stuff, anyway? Basically, “Scotch” refers to malt whisky or 
grain whisky (note the spelling: There’s no “I” in “team,” but in Scotland, 
there’s no “e” in “whisky,” either) that’s made in Scotland. (By law, whiskies 
labeled as “Scotch” must be made in Scotland, so don’t bother looking: You 
won’t find American-made Scotch.) It’s often made from barley, which has 
been malted. That is, the grains have been placed in water and allowed to 
germinate, and are then removed from the water and dried in hot air to stop 
the germination process. Scotch whisky usually clocks in at between forty 
percent and forty-six percent alcohol by volume, and it must be aged for at 
least three years (and it’s often aged for much longer than that). Part of the 
aging process often takes place in wooden casks that were formerly used to 
store port, sherry, or even bourbon. 
When it comes to the flavor, character, and aromatics of this venerable 
spirit, each version is unique: Part of the wonder inherent in experimenting 
with Scotch is that each expression of the spirit will be different to the last 
one that you tried. Some Scotch whiskies are sweet and delicate; some 
are lightly smoky and fruity; and some are dark, heavily smoky, peaty, and 
earthy. Not every variety of Scotch whisky will appeal to you, and that’s fine. 
A good rule of thumb is simply to experiment with an open mind—you’re 
sure to find at least one, if not many, that you enjoy. As in love, so in spirits: 
Just like the best relationships, knowing and loving Scotch is a quest that 
can and should become a lifelong endeavor. SIDENOTECOOL-WEATHER COCKTAILS •

YOUR BOSS IS ON VACATION AND YOU’VE BEEN SUPER-PRODUCTIVE ALL MORNING; AND

STRAIGHT BACK TO BED; OR JOINT PAIN THAT JUST WON’T QUIT. AND YOU’RE NOT SURE  
HOW YOU’RE GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE REST OF THE DAY IN ONE PIECE. OY VEY . 
ACHES AND PAINS LIKE THESE CAN BE VERY FRUSTRATING, AND EVEN DEBILITATING. SO  
WHAT’S A BODY TO DO?  A sk your ancestors. For hundreds of years, sufferers have been visiting apothecaries seeking 
solutions for pain of all sorts. Some early analgesics contained powerful concentrations of 
highly addictive, narcotic drugs, including heroin, morphine, and cocaine.  Sometimes the 
cure truly was worse than the disease: Users of drugs like these ran a significant risk of becoming 
addicted to them, replacing illness with dependence. Happily, though, there were far less risky—and, arguably, more effective—curatives at the apothecary’s disposal. Many herbs, spices, fruits, and vege-
tables contain natural properties that can easy bodily pain and calm the sufferer’s uneasy, stressed-out 
mind. But these delicate botanicals had to be preserved: Without refrigeration, many of them would 
have rotted, ruining their restorative properties—especially in warmer climates. That’s where alcohol 
comes in. Suspending fragile botanicals in alcohol prevents rotting, and can release their potential 
healing benefits. Blackberries, for example, have been used as analgesics for centuries—but how to 
preserve their painkilling power for months at a time? The answer is simple: Combine them with 
high-proof spirits into delicious infusions that’ll last well into winter.
 Of course, there are hundreds of natural remedies for easing pain. Celery juice has been used 
as an analgesic since Roman times, and today, it may be effective in reducing arthritis-related joint 
pain. Lavender, peppermint, and clary sage have offered relief from stress-induced headaches for 
centuries, while chamomile calms the entire body and, some say, quickly relieves menstrual pain. The 
herb lemon balm, a relative of peppermint, is also said to relieve stubborn body aches. Nutmeg is said 
to restore a wilting appetite, which can help ease the headaches and fatigue brought on by hunger. 
Turmeric, garlic, ginger, chiles, poppy seeds, and anise also have venerable reputations as painkillers.
 And when it comes to cocktails, there are plenty of easy-to-make drinks that are surprisingly 
effective at banishing pain, since they feature ingredients that old-time pharmacists would have had 
at their fingertips. For instance, my Lemon Balm Gin and Tonic sports a dose of lemon balm-en-
hanced simple syrup, which may ease digestive disorders and help mitigate bodily pain in general. 
Then there’s the whiskey- and coffee-laced Revenge of the Painkiller, a luscious concoction that’ll 
chill you out and get rid of that pesky caffeine-withdrawal headache. Nineteeth-century tipplers 
would have recommended the Green Fairy to fight pain, so you might want to reach for that bottle 
of absinthe and make a Soft Grey Lace, a winning combination of quinoa whiskey, absinthe, ginger 
beer, and a dusting of cayenne pepper—or an icy, mint-laden Absinthe Frappé, since cool, refreshing 
liquids never do any harm when it comes to easing pain. (Remember that it’s important to stay 
hydrated, especially when you’re drinking alcohol: in fact, sometimes simply drinking a fizzy glass of 
seltzer water can be a quick way to keep pain at bay.)
 If you haven’t got time for the pain—and who does?—whip up a couple of the craft cocktails in

(Text)SO FAR, YOUR DAY’S BEEN JUST FINE. THERE’S NO TRAFFIC ON YOUR MORNING COMMUTE;  
YOUR BOSS IS ON VACATION AND YOU’VE BEEN SUPER-PRODUCTIVE ALL MORNING; AND  
YOU GOT YOUR FAVORITE CHINESE TAKEOUT FOR LUNCH. THEN: WHAM. PAIN STRIKES.  
NOW YOU’VE GOT THE HEADACHE FROM HELL; A BACKACHE THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO GO  
STRAIGHT BACK TO BED; OR JOINT PAIN THAT JUST WON’T QUIT. AND YOU’RE NOT SURE  
HOW YOU’RE GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE REST OF THE DAY IN ONE PIECE. OY VEY . 
ACHES AND PAINS LIKE THESE CAN BE VERY FRUSTRATING, AND EVEN DEBILITATING. SO  
WHAT’S A BODY TO DO?  A sk your ancestors. For hundreds of years, sufferers have been visiting apothecaries seeking 
solutions for pain of all sorts. Some early analgesics contained powerful concentrations of 
highly addictive, narcotic drugs, including heroin, morphine, and cocaine.  Sometimes the 
cure truly was worse than the disease: Users of drugs like these ran a significant risk of becoming 
addicted to them, replacing illness with dependence. Happily, though, there were far less risky—and, arguably, more effective—curatives at the apothecary’s disposal. Many herbs, spices, fruits, and vege-
tables contain natural properties that can easy bodily pain and calm the sufferer’s uneasy, stressed-out 
mind. But these delicate botanicals had to be preserved: Without refrigeration, many of them would 
have rotted, ruining their restorative properties—especially in warmer climates. That’s where alcohol 
comes in. Suspending fragile botanicals in alcohol prevents rotting, and can release their potential 
healing benefits. Blackberries, for example, have been used as analgesics for centuries—but how to 
preserve their painkilling power for months at a time? The answer is simple: Combine them with 
high-proof spirits into delicious infusions that’ll last well into winter.
 Of course, there are hundreds of natural remedies for easing pain. Celery juice has been used 
as an analgesic since Roman times, and today, it may be effective in reducing arthritis-related joint 
pain. Lavender, peppermint, and clary sage have offered relief from stress-induced headaches for 
centuries, while chamomile calms the entire body and, some say, quickly relieves menstrual pain. The 
herb lemon balm, a relative of peppermint, is also said to relieve stubborn body aches. Nutmeg is said 
to restore a wilting appetite, which can help ease the headaches and fatigue brought on by hunger. 
Turmeric, garlic, ginger, chiles, poppy seeds, and anise also have venerable reputations as painkillers.
 And when it comes to cocktails, there are plenty of easy-to-make drinks that are surprisingly 
effective at banishing pain, since they feature ingredients that old-time pharmacists would have had 
at their fingertips. For instance, my Lemon Balm Gin and Tonic sports a dose of lemon balm-en-
hanced simple syrup, which may ease digestive disorders and help mitigate bodily pain in general. 
Then there’s the whiskey- and coffee-laced Revenge of the Painkiller, a luscious concoction that’ll 
chill you out and get rid of that pesky caffeine-withdrawal headache. Nineteeth-century tipplers 
would have recommended the Green Fairy to fight pain, so you might want to reach for that bottle

(Text)LEMON BALM GIN AND TONIC 
When headaches strike, they can be distracting and even debilitating. Instead of reaching for 
synthetic painkillers, try a restorative cocktail made with lemon balm, a popular herbal cure that 
old-time pharmacists would’ve sworn by. Its lemon-scented leaves boast a long history of treating 
tension and stress, promoting refreshing sleep, sharpening concentration, improving mental 
performance, and easing nervous conditions that may lead to headaches and even migraines. Here, 
it’s infused in simple syrup and served up on ice with a generous dose of gin for a prescriptive 
take on the classic gin and tonic.  
_ 3 OUNCES (90 ML) BOTANICAL GIN
_ 2 TABLESPOONS (30 ML) LEMON BALM  
SIMPLE SYRUP (SEE PAGE 312)
_ 1/4 FRESH LIME, CUT INTO CHUNKSINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Pack a tall glass with ice; then slowly pour the gin over the 
ice so it’s well chilled. Add the lemon balm simple syrup, 
and mix well. Top it with the tonic water and garnish 
with a lime chunk or two for an extra spritz of citrus. It’s 
sure to clear the head and chase pesky headaches away.
BLACKBERRY ELIXIR
Berries are truly one of nature’s superfoods. Today, we know that they’re high in antioxidants, jam-
packed (no pun intended!) with vitamin C, folic acid, and potassium, and may play a role in cancer 
prevention. But that wouldn’t have surprised German apothecaries of days gone by: In Germany, 
blackberries and elderberries have been prized for their painkilling properties for hundreds of years. 
Blackberries contain salicylic acid—a compound that’s also present in aspirin while elderberries 
are said to combat pain resulting from rheumatism or traumatic injuries. Blackberry brandy, which apothecaries once prescribed as an able painkiller, is at the heart of this luscious elixir.

Combine the egg white and lime juice in a Boston shaker, and 
shake without ice—a technique known as dry shaking—for one 
minute until the egg white stands up in fluffy peaks. Add 2 
tablespoons (30 ml) of the berry infusion and the gin; then fill 
the shaker three-quarters full with ice, and shake for twenty 
seconds until well-combined. Place the remaining tablespoon of 
the berry puree into a coupé glass, and pour the mixture over it.

Nutmeg has been highly prized by apothecaries, cooks, and diners alike 
since at least the early medieval period. (In fact, when Christopher Columbus 
set out in search of the East Indies, nutmeg was one of the valuable spices he 
was seeking, along with mustard seed, peppercorns, turmeric, ginger root, 
and many others.) It’s widely used in cuisines around the world, and early 
pharmacists would have known that a dash of nutmeg could act as an 
appetite stimulant and an antibacterial, and could ease certain psycho-
logical conditions, such as those which cause insomnia. And its essential 
oil has been said to alleviate joint pain. Don’t start chomping down whole 
nutmeg seeds, though: in large quantities, nutmeg can be psychoactive, 
and even toxic.

Whisperer’s riff on the classic Painkiller. A famously dangerous drink that hails from the British 
islands in the Caribbean, your average, everyday Painkiller consists of rum, pineapple juice, orange 
juice, and cream of coconut. But, if you ask me, the ingredients in my version are far more interest-
ing. Here, rye binds espresso, rum, coffee liqueur, and chocolate liqueur together in a lip-smacking 
concoction that’s very effective when sipped just before lunch in the hot sun, on the prow of a 
yacht, or beside a swimming pool. (Do pre-chill your glassware with crushed ice before serving: 
Revenge is a drink best served iced.) This lush cocktail is built for two, so share it with someone 
special. Otherwise, the Painkiller has a tendency to bite back. 
INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Add all the liquid ingredients and the crushed ice to a blender, and 
pulse until smooth. Pour the mixture into pre-chilled pint glasses, 
and scrape some fresh nutmeg over the top. (Avoid the pre-ground 
stuff—fresh nutmeg is so much better!) Garnish each drink with 
an Easy Home-Cured Cocktail Cherry, and serve with straws.  REVENGE OF THE PAINKILLER

(Text)SOFT GREY LACE
This cocktail doesn’t do what it says on the label. There’s nothing soft or grey about it—although 
it is “laced” with lime and cayenne pepper for a riff on the famous (or infamous?) Moscow Mule. 
I like to make it with quinoa whiskey, which starts off dry on the palate, and then mellows into 
sweetness and a pillow-soft finish. That said, I think quinoa whiskey benefits from a fizzy mixer, 
hence the addition of cane-sugar beer. While the traditional Moscow Mule is little more than 
vodka and ginger beer served up in a mug, using quinoa whiskey and washing the pre-chilled 
mugs with absinthe really makes this drink shine. Plus, it’s a great hangover cure: It’s cold and 
refreshing, but a judicious dash of cayenne will help you sweat out the effects of the night before. 
_ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) QUINOA WHISKEY
_ 1/2 OUNCE (15 ML) ABSINTHE_ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) CANE  
SUGAR-BASED GINGER BEER   
_ VERY LIGHT DUSTING OF CAYENNE PEPPERINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Pre-chill a mug by filling it with ice water and the absinthe, 
and then pour the icy mixture out (into your mouth, that is: 
No wasting good liquor, remember?) Pack your chilled mug 
with crushed ice, and then add the quinoa whiskey. Mix very 
gently with a long spoon. Dust the mixture with the cayenne 
pepper, then the ginger beer, and stir gently again. Sip cautiously, 
armed with cold towels for your soon-to-be sweaty brow! 
WATERMELON “MARTINI” 
Watermelon packs an especially substantial wallop of antioxidants. Cocktails that include water-
melon, like this refreshing Watermelon Martini, may help to relieve headaches and back pain. 
Inspired by apothecaries of yesteryear, who would have preserved concoctions of fruits and spices 
in preservative spirits, it combines freshly crushed watermelon with aromatic, curative vermouth 
and citrus-tinged, botanical gin. It’s a deeply delicious curative that helps assuage aches gently 
and quickly. 
_ 1/2 OUNCE (15 ML) DRY VERMOUTH
_ 3 OUNCES (90 ML) BOTANICAL GIN_ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) PUREED WATERMELON_ LEMON ZEST TWISTINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Wash a cocktail shaker with the vermouth; then pour it out (into 
your mouth, if you like!). Fill the shaker one-quarter full with 
ice; then add the gin and pureed watermelon. Stir, strain into 
a coupé glass, and garnish with a lemon zest twist. Prost!

Thyme as a tonic. Since time immemorial, the herb thyme has been 
prized for its stimulating, balancing, and purifying properties. In healing 
preparations of old, pharmacists may have used it in a number of ways: as 
an antispasmodic, an antifungal, a digestive aid, a remedy for respiratory 
infections—“It is a noble strengthener of the lungs, as notable a one as 
grows,” wrote Nicholas Culpeper in his Complete Herbal (1652)—and to 
promote healthy circulation and overall good health. Because it’s highly 
antiseptic, early pharmacists would also have used thyme in a number 
of topical preparations, including salves and liniments. And the ancient 
Greeks and Romans used it as incense, believing that it would imbue 
soldiers with courage before battle. Just another reason to mix yourself a 
bracing, stimulating Old Oak Tree! SIDENOTE

Thyme as a tonic. Since time immemorial, the herb thyme has been 
prized for its stimulating, balancing, and purifying properties. In healing 
preparations of old, pharmacists may have used it in a number of ways: as 
an antispasmodic, an antifungal, a digestive aid, a remedy for respiratory 
infections—“It is a noble strengthener of the lungs, as notable a one as 
grows,” wrote Nicholas Culpeper in his Complete Herbal (1652)—and to 
promote healthy circulation and overall good health. Because it’s highly 
antiseptic, early pharmacists would also have used thyme in a number 
of topical preparations, including salves and liniments. And the ancient 
Greeks and Romans used it as incense, believing that it would imbue 
soldiers with courage before battle. Just another reason to mix yourself a 
bracing, stimulating Old Oak Tree! SIDENOTE

bitters, but this curative libation is rum-based, and it calls for a hit of fresh lime juice, which is 
a great complement to the rum. If you ask me, this restorative, analgesic cocktail can relieve the 
pain of just about any minor injury—from the inside out.

_ CRUSHED, PEBBLE-SIZED ICE  These days, when we think of frappés, we usually imagine high-octane, sugar-laden, iced-coffee 
drinks. Traditionally, though, a frappé is simply a liqueur poured over shaved ice—and it can be 
a delicious, refreshing treat. This take on the frappé privileges absinthe, which has a reputation 
for alleviating aches of all sorts due to its high alcohol level. Known as the Green Fairy because 
of the high chlorophyll levels of the botanicals originally used in its production—and because the 
psychoactive substances that were also present in them could make heavy drinkers hallucinate—
absinthe is said to ease headaches and general malaise, and to soothe stomachs made ornery from 
exposure to spoiled food. Absinthe frappés have their roots in hot, humid New Orleans, where 
they were considered to be elegant, cooling potions that could be enjoyed all year.
INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Combine the absinthe, simple syrup, and mint leaves in a 
large martini glass. Add the ice a spoonful at a time as you 
stir the absinthe mixture gently with a bar spoon, so that the 
glass becomes frosty. When the glass is nearly full, top with 
the seltzer water and stir gently. Tear a few mint leaves and 
strew them over the top of the drink. When nothing else will 
shift that truly dogged headache, this icy concoction can help. ABSINTHE FRAPPE

NECTAR, PREFERABLY ORGANICThis thermos-friendly cocktail for two was inspired by a halcyon trip I took one summer, out the 
Two-Mile Hollow Lane on the east end of New Y ork State’s Long Island. It’s an easily trans-
portable slurp, and it’s simply made, with only a handful of healing ingredients, including white 
whiskey, absinthe, peach nectar, and cooled jasmine tea. (According to the seventeenth-century 
Culpeper’s Complete Herbal, peach-kernels were meant to “wonderfully ease the pains and wring-
ings of the belly through wind or sharp humours.”) Make a batch, then pour it into an insulated 
flask or thermos, and head for the beach: the fresh sea air will clear your head as the Two-Mile 
sweeps your ache and pains out to sea. Forget the sugar-laden, frat-boy cocktail most bars call the 
Long Island Iced Tea; this Long-Island-inspired tipple is the real deal.

Add all the ingredients to a Boston shaker filled three-quarters full with 
ice, and shake like crazy for about 15 seconds. (You may have to do this

Green around the gills? Go for green tea. There are plenty 
of reasons to sneak a little extra green tea into your diet. While moderate 
consumption of black tea has been shown to be a healthy habit, green tea, 
which has been drunk in China for thousands of years, boasts an even wider 
range of health benefits. Drinking just one cup per day can significantly 
increase the body’s antioxidant levels; lower cholesterol; may help to reduce 
the risk of liver and cardiovascular diseases; and may be able to aid in weight 
loss. Since it may help to stabilize blood sugar, it might even have positive 
effects on type 2 diabetes, and it’s said to improve cognitive function as well, 
reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. It’s an all-round winner. SIDENOTE

                       0850 - Craft Cocktail Compendium_int.indd   178 1/13/17   2:19 PMGenever, the botanical gin that hails from Holland and Belgium, has been used as a curative for 
centuries, and it’s packed with healing ingredients like nutmeg, angelica, thistle, and grains of 
paradise. This tonic unites citrus, fresh ginger, green tea, and mineral-rich Brazil nuts, which are 
meant to reduce inflammation and relieve pain, into a warming prescription that eases all sorts 
of aches. 
Combine all ingredients in a small saucepan and warm over low 
heat until the ginger releases its perfume (about 10 minutes). 
Pour into teacups and serve: Relief is just a few minutes away. GREEN TEA TONIC
Green around the gills? Go for green tea. There are plenty 
of reasons to sneak a little extra green tea into your diet. While moderate 
consumption of black tea has been shown to be a healthy habit, green tea, 
which has been drunk in China for thousands of years, boasts an even wider 
range of health benefits. Drinking just one cup per day can significantly 
increase the body’s antioxidant levels; lower cholesterol; may help to reduce 
the risk of liver and cardiovascular diseases; and may be able to aid in weight 
loss. Since it may help to stabilize blood sugar, it might even have positive 
effects on type 2 diabetes, and it’s said to improve cognitive function as well, 
reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. It’s an all-round winner.

(Text)PAIN-PROOF GARDEN ELIXIR CHAMOIS CLOTH SHAKE
If you’re suffering from joint pain due to arthritis, natural remedies may help—and one particularly 
powerful remedy comes straight from the garden. Fresh vegetables can assist in the treatment of 
arthritis, especially those with vibrant colors: think spinach, broccoli, tomatoes, and carrots. The 
antioxidants in these vegetables help reduce joint swelling and inflammation, and the more you eat 
of them, the better. Here, a variety of veggies are lightly steamed, then pureed into a concentrated 
“soup” that’s packed with pain-fighting nutrients. Adding vodka turns the healthy mixture into a 
miniature cocktail that can be served Russian-style: that is, well chilled, and doled out in shot 
glasses. (Talk about literally drinking to your health.) If you enjoy a classic Bloody Mary, you’ll 
love this savory, nutritious libation. No matter how sophisticated you might be, you’re never too cool for a milkshake. Especially when 
that milkshake is, in essence, a Creamsicle for grownups. As soft and smooth as its eponymous 
chamois cloth, this chilled-out cocktail spikes orange sorbet with white whiskey and a soupçon of 
rosemary-infused simple syrup, which lends it a woody, elegant edge. Blitz up a batch of Chamois 
Cloth Shakes to cleanse your guests’ palates after a leisurely weekend lunch. (It’s a good idea to 
serve them as quickly as possible after blending for brightness of flavour, so don’t make them ahead 
of time.) If you’re a glutton for punishment, go ahead and make your own gelato, but you really 
don’t need to—the store-bought stuff works perfectly. The result is a soothing, cooling libation that 
literally takes seconds to whip up.

CUP, FRESHLY POLISHEDI’m more than a little obsessed with the mint julep in all of its incarnations. That’s because my 
very first mint julep looms so large in my memory: it was made with care in an antique silver 
cup in Charleston, South Carolina. The sensation of that drink’s icy, refreshing chill against the 
steamy Charleston night has stayed with me to this day—and it’s what’s inspired the Sleepy Time 
Down South of Broad cocktail. This tipple reads like your traditional mint julep—but it takes a 
sharp right turn off Tradd Street and heads down South of Broad, since it calls for white whiskey 
instead of the traditional bourbon. And if you haven’t slapped your fresh mint before, you should 
start now: Remove mint leaves from their bitter stem, place them in one hand, and slap your other 
hand against it. This releases mint’s aromatic oils, without chopping or tearing it. Get slapping, 
and start mixing! 
INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Muddle 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the slapped mint with half of the 
sugar in the bottom of the silver cup to release the mint’s fragrant 
oils (with a non-metal utensil, preferably; never use stainless 
metal against sterling silver, ever!). Add about half of the white 
whiskey and some crushed ice to the cup, and mix. Then add more 
ice, the rest of the sugar, the rest of the white whiskey, and the rest 
of the mint; stir gently until your cup is frosty and glistening. True

(Text)ABRUZZO-STYLE CAFFÈ CORRETTO SWEET SHERRY ELIXIR
When I travel abroad, I pay close attention to what the locals are drinking. On a recent trip to Italy, 
I saw lots of people take small cups of caffè corretto at coffee bars in the mornings. And the actions 
of the barman who was preparing them were so simple and precise: He just pulled an espresso into 
a preheated ceramic cup, added about half an ounce of Jack Daniels from a bottle he grabbed from 
behind the coffee bar, and served it up. There was a perfect, measured cadence to his movements: 
Take order, preheat cup, pull espresso, correct, serve, and drink (well, it was the customer who was 
doing the drinking, actually, but still). The whole process was so elegant that I just had to include 
it here—not least because a prudent amount of liquor combined with a buzz of caffeine can wipe 
away even the most pernicious pain: There’s nothing better for banishing jetlag!The essential oil of the herb oregano is another powerful ally when it comes to fighting pain. It’s 
said to alleviate arthritis pain as well as headaches of all sorts and descriptions, and in some cultures, 
is even used to relieve sore throats. But you don’t need to use very much of this intensely flavored 
herb to heal deeply: Just a drop or two will do the trick. And, curiously, oregano’s flavor is a good 
complement to sweet sherry. Happily, sherry isn’t just for medicinal purposes: It’s an important 
ingredient in cocktails, and, of course, it’s delicious on its own. When the two are combined, the 
result is a sweet earthiness that’s intensely relaxing. (In the past, the pharmacist might even have 
prepared a batch of oregano-based bitters especially for this curative tipple.) Today, this simple 
cocktail is still a winner.

_ 1 DROP (AND NO MORE THAN 1  
DROP!) OIL OF OREGANOINGREDIENTS INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Pour the sherry into a brandy snifter (or small juice glass). Then, 
using a medicine dropper (or just extreme care), add a single drop 
of oil of oregano to the sherry. Sniff deeply, inhaling the potent, 
earthy aroma. Then pick up your glass and put the aspirin away!
Sherry’s delicious history. Does the word “sherry” conjure up black-
and-white images of men in stiff suits circa 1950 clutching tiny glasses? Well, 
far from being passé, sherry is very much back in fashion these days, and it’s 
turning up in craft cocktail bars all over the place: It’s now gracing Bloody Marys, 
martinis, and lots more. But what is sherry, and where does it come from? Here’s 
a quick rundown. The resin-colored tipple is a fortified wine with its origins in the

(Text)ABRUZZO-STYLE CAFFÈ CORRETTO SWEET SHERRY ELIXIR
When I travel abroad, I pay close attention to what the locals are drinking. On a recent trip to Italy, 
I saw lots of people take small cups of caffè corretto at coffee bars in the mornings. And the actions 
of the barman who was preparing them were so simple and precise: He just pulled an espresso into 
a preheated ceramic cup, added about half an ounce of Jack Daniels from a bottle he grabbed from 
behind the coffee bar, and served it up. There was a perfect, measured cadence to his movements: 
Take order, preheat cup, pull espresso, correct, serve, and drink (well, it was the customer who was 
doing the drinking, actually, but still). The whole process was so elegant that I just had to include 
it here—not least because a prudent amount of liquor combined with a buzz of caffeine can wipe 
away even the most pernicious pain: There’s nothing better for banishing jetlag!The essential oil of the herb oregano is another powerful ally when it comes to fighting pain. It’s 
said to alleviate arthritis pain as well as headaches of all sorts and descriptions, and in some cultures, 
is even used to relieve sore throats. But you don’t need to use very much of this intensely flavored 
herb to heal deeply: Just a drop or two will do the trick. And, curiously, oregano’s flavor is a good 
complement to sweet sherry. Happily, sherry isn’t just for medicinal purposes: It’s an important 
ingredient in cocktails, and, of course, it’s delicious on its own. When the two are combined, the 
result is a sweet earthiness that’s intensely relaxing. (In the past, the pharmacist might even have 
prepared a batch of oregano-based bitters especially for this curative tipple.) Today, this simple 
cocktail is still a winner.

Preheat your espresso cup by filling it with boiling water, 
and then pour out the boiling water. Pull a single espresso into the cup (it should be no more than one ounce [30 ml]). Now, add the medicine: “Correct” it by adding the Tennessee sipping whiskey, and stir in a bit of sugar. Sip down in one gulp, look around, and have another. It’s the Italian way!  Pour the sherry into a brandy snifter (or small juice glass). Then, 
using a medicine dropper (or just extreme care), add a single drop 
of oil of oregano to the sherry. Sniff deeply, inhaling the potent, 
earthy aroma. Then pick up your glass and put the aspirin away!
Sherry’s delicious history. Does the word “sherry” conjure up black-
and-white images of men in stiff suits circa 1950 clutching tiny glasses? Well, 
far from being passé, sherry is very much back in fashion these days, and it’s 
turning up in craft cocktail bars all over the place: It’s now gracing Bloody Marys, 
martinis, and lots more. But what is sherry, and where does it come from? Here’s 
a quick rundown. The resin-colored tipple is a fortified wine with its origins in the 
town of Jerez in the Andalusia region of Spain, where wines and fortified wines 
have been produced for centuries, but these days it’s made all over the world.

(Text)THE HARTLEY DODGE COCKTAIL COFFEE SOYMILK SHAKE
Vegans, rejoice! Although there have been a lot of mixed messages about the health benefits of soy, it’s 
been a staple of Asian diets for thousands of years, and today, soy milk is still a great source of protein: 
It may help restore and repair damaged muscle tissue and contains pain-alleviating compounds. Thus 
there’s no reason why you shouldn’t enjoy a soymilk shake after a long workout, or if you’re simply 
feeling achy. A soymilk shake like this one, made with coffee liqueur and overproof rum, can help 
fight pain, especially pain in the extremities, such as fingers and toes. (Is that due to the healing 
powers of soy, or to the rum? Try one and find out.)
_ 3 SLICES FRESH PEACH, PLUS  
EXTRA SLICES FOR GARNISH
_ 3 OUNCES (90 ML) BONDED  
100-PROOF BOURBON WHISKEY
_ 1 OUNCE (25 ML) SWEET VERMOUTH
_ 4 DASHES BITTERS_ ICE CUBES_ 6 OUNCES (175 ML) SOY MILK
_ 1 OUNCE (25 ML) COFFEE LIQUEUR  
_ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) OVERPROOF RUM
_ ICEINGREDIENTSINGREDIENTS
DIRECTIONS
Place the peach slices in a Boston shaker, and muddle them. Add the 
bourbon and vermouth, continue to muddle so that the flavors are well 
combined. Add the bitters and a handful of ice cubes, and stir well. 
Strain into a Collins glass over a large chunk of ice (larger pieces of ice 
are less likely to dilute the drink). Garnish with an extra slice or two 
of fresh peach. It’s an analgesic that can’t help but take the edge off 
what ails you. Bourbon or rye whiskey combined with sweet vermouth laced with healing bitters can act as a pow-
erful painkiller. Although this prescriptive resembles the classic Manhattan, adding muddled peach 
slices to the mix adds a sweet, fresh, seasonal flavor thanks to the summery stone fruit. And it’s a fine 
balance: The key to this healing cocktail lies in the right proportions of sweet, savory, and blatantly 
powerful. When combined with the bottled-in-bond bourbon whiskey, the flavor of the peaches 
becomes even more intense. “Bottled in bond,” means the bourbon has been produced according to 
strict regulations, and it makes for a tastier—and more effective—cocktail. Give it a try: The Hartley 
Dodge has been known to conquer even the most tenacious aches and pains.

fight pain, especially pain in the extremities, such as fingers and toes. (Is that due to the healing 
powers of soy, or to the rum? Try one and find out.)

Place the peach slices in a Boston shaker, and muddle them. Add the 
bourbon and vermouth, continue to muddle so that the flavors are well 
combined. Add the bitters and a handful of ice cubes, and stir well. 
Strain into a Collins glass over a large chunk of ice (larger pieces of ice 
are less likely to dilute the drink). Garnish with an extra slice or two 
of fresh peach. It’s an analgesic that can’t help but take the edge off 
what ails you. Combine the soy milk, coffee liqueur, rum, and ice in a blender. 
Process until smooth; pour into a tall glass; and serve with a straw 
or two. Remember to sip slowly, or you’ll bring on another kind of 
pain: the dreaded ice-cream headache.Bourbon or rye whiskey combined with sweet vermouth laced with healing bitters can act as a pow -
erful painkiller. Although this prescriptive resembles the classic Manhattan, adding muddled peach 
slices to the mix adds a sweet, fresh, seasonal flavor thanks to the summery stone fruit. And it’s a fine 
balance: The key to this healing cocktail lies in the right proportions of sweet, savory, and blatantly 
powerful. When combined with the bottled-in-bond bourbon whiskey, the flavor of the peaches 
becomes even more intense. “Bottled in bond,” means the bourbon has been produced according to 
strict regulations, and it makes for a tastier—and more effective—cocktail. Give it a try: The Hartley 
Dodge has been known to conquer even the most tenacious aches and pains. POTENT PAINKILLERS •

Vegans, rejoice! Although there have been a lot of mixed messages about the health benefits of soy, it’s 
been a staple of Asian diets for thousands of years, and today, soy milk is still a great source of protein: 
It may help restore and repair damaged muscle tissue and contains pain-alleviating compounds. Thus 
there’s no reason why you shouldn’t enjoy a soymilk shake after a long workout, or if you’re simply

(Text)CAMPARI AND SODA WATER QUICK FIX 
THE PAINKILLER PRESCRIPTIVECampari, that ultra-powerful Italian digestive, has an incredible red hue due to its unique mixture 
of citrus, herbs, and spices. The medicinal tipple is often mixed with a dose of freshly squeezed 
lemon juice to ward off the scourge of vitamin C deficiencies and other nutrition-related maladies. 
It’s often taken neat, but with the addition of a few ounces of carbonated water, Campari becomes 
more than just an after-dinner treat: It’s transformed into a prescriptive that can affect the spirit 
as well as the body. Sparkling water delivers the scent of the aromatic, therapeutic herbs straight 
into the patient’s nose, relieving his stomachache, headache, and grumpy mood all at once. Aperol, 
another bright-red, Italian-made herbal liqueur, can be substituted for the Campari in this easy 
recipe: It’s used to liven up diners’ moods and whet their appetites before big meals. 
The Painkiller Prescriptive has its origins at a beach bar known as the Soggy Dollar, on the island 
of Jost Van Dyke in the British Virgin Islands. Medicinal preparations were available at this 
apothecary-cum-bar nearly every day during the winter and spring sailing seasons. If a sailor had 
spent the night in the grip of that demon, the “old black rum,” a dose of this fruity prescriptive 
would be sure to cure him of the affliction—and fast. A distant cousin of the pina colada, the 
Painkiller both refreshes and heals: The citrus juices offer a wallop of immunity-boosting vitamin 
C, while the coconut provides potassium and adds creaminess and heft. Nutmeg, which has long 
been used to rouse the appetite, tops off the Painkiller—and, of course, the rum warms and 
soothes the sufferer’s mind and body. _ 4 OUNCES (120 ML) CAMPARI

(Text)SYMPATHIZE, FOR A MOMENT, WITH THE HUMBLE STOMACH. A MULTI-COURSE MEAL CAN  
FLIP IT OUT; A DOSE OF THE FLU CAN THROW IT INTO SERIOUS DISTRESS; AND A CASE OF  
JITTERY NERVES SENDS IT STRAIGHT INTO SOS MODE. AND IF YOU THINK THAT’S ROUGH  
ENOUGH, GET THIS: OUR FOREFATHERS HAD IT EVEN WORSE.  H ere’s why: Before the twentieth century, home refrigerators were futuristic dreams, so it was 
tough to prevent food from spoiling. Plus, kitchen hygiene wasn’t what it is nowadays, and 
antibiotics and flu shots had yet to be discovered. This means indigestion, bellyaches, and food 
poisoning ran rampant, and apothecaries had to be well-versed in remedies to soothe the tumultuous 
tummy. With the help of local botanicals, pharmacists would mix herbal tinctures and tonics that could 
alleviate nausea and stomach pain, and suspend the mixtures in doses of alcohol to keep them fresh. 
These curatives were available only at the apothecary’s shop. Their recipes were usually closely guarded, 
and they’re the ancestors of digestifs that are still enjoyed around the world today, such as Chartreuse, 
Fernet Branca, amaro, and Bénédictine. Usually taken after dinner to ease bellies that might be suffering 
from too much good food and drink, these liqueurs often have a bracingly bitter flavor from the wide 
variety of herbs used to produce them. 
 Other liquors, too, were created to relieve digestive disorders and make massive meals go down a bit 
more smoothly. Brandy, for example, was thought to be a powerful laxative and purgative. Apothecaries 
prescribed it in the hopes that it would quickly eliminate harmful toxins in cases of poisoning. (It 
was even used to treat recovering opium addicts after an initial purge using vinegar and water. Yikes.) 
Aromatic bitters, which are related to herbal liquors like Italian amari, would have been used liberally in 
curatives, or taken on their own with a dash of fizzy water in order to calm edgy stomachs. 
 Potent liquors and bitter herbs weren’t the only belly-friendly ingredients an apothecary would 
have had on hand, either. Garden vegetables like rhubarb and fennel could also help relieve stomach 
ailments. Rhubarb is an effective laxative, and has been used to promote good digestion for centuries. 
And crunchy, anise-flavored fennel, too, is good for the belly: eaten raw or taken as an herbal tea, 
apothecaries would’ve recommended it to folks who had overindulged in their victuals (and their cups!).
 Pharmacists of yesteryear would also have worked household staples into their curatives. Sparkling 
waters such as club soda, seltzer water, and quinine-rich tonic water, for example, often top off stom-
ach-soothing libations, and can even bring relief on their own. Like ginger beer, their effervescence can 
refresh tired palates, and seems to make all the difference when it comes to indigestion. (Bubbles make 
everything better, don’t they?) This chapter shows you how to craft bellyache-banishing concoctions, 
like digestives, fizzes, liquor-laced coffees, and gastriques. Where to start? For a speedy cure, go for a 
Habsburg Stomach Healer, which combines the Hungarian liqueur Zwack with tonic water and curried 
bitters—or, to prevent tummy upsets at a morning-after brunch, make my Blackberry-Fennel Shrub, 
then use it in a round of As We Approached St-Denis (here, the bubbles come from champagne!). You 
can take curative shrubs to the table, too: my Red Berry Gastrique is, in essence, a digestive-shrub-
turned-sauce, and it’s a great accompaniment to just about any dessert. And that’s just the beginning.

variety of herbs used to produce them. 
 Other liquors, too, were created to relieve digestive disorders and make massive meals go down a bit 
more smoothly. Brandy, for example, was thought to be a powerful laxative and purgative. Apothecaries 
prescribed it in the hopes that it would quickly eliminate harmful toxins in cases of poisoning. (It 
was even used to treat recovering opium addicts after an initial purge using vinegar and water. Yikes.) 
Aromatic bitters, which are related to herbal liquors like Italian amari, would have been used liberally in 
curatives, or taken on their own with a dash of fizzy water in order to calm edgy stomachs. 
 Potent liquors and bitter herbs weren’t the only belly-friendly ingredients an apothecary would 
have had on hand, either. Garden vegetables like rhubarb and fennel could also help relieve stomach 
ailments. Rhubarb is an effective laxative, and has been used to promote good digestion for centuries. 
And crunchy, anise-flavored fennel, too, is good for the belly: eaten raw or taken as an herbal tea, 
apothecaries would’ve recommended it to folks who had overindulged in their victuals (and their cups!).
 Pharmacists of yesteryear would also have worked household staples into their curatives. Sparkling 
waters such as club soda, seltzer water, and quinine-rich tonic water, for example, often top off stom-
ach-soothing libations, and can even bring relief on their own. Like ginger beer, their effervescence can 
refresh tired palates, and seems to make all the difference when it comes to indigestion. (Bubbles make 
everything better, don’t they?) This chapter shows you how to craft bellyache-banishing concoctions, 
like digestives, fizzes, liquor-laced coffees, and gastriques. Where to start? For a speedy cure, go for a 
Habsburg Stomach Healer, which combines the Hungarian liqueur Zwack with tonic water and curried 
bitters—or, to prevent tummy upsets at a morning-after brunch, make my Blackberry-Fennel Shrub, 
then use it in a round of As We Approached St-Denis (here, the bubbles come from champagne!). You 
can take curative shrubs to the table, too: my Red Berry Gastrique is, in essence, a digestive-shrub-
turned-sauce, and it’s a great accompaniment to just about any dessert. And that’s just the beginning.

(Text)BLACKBERRY-FENNEL SHRUB HABSBURG STOMACH HEALER
Made from produce that would have grown wild in America’s early days, this very special classic 
shrub is delicious during the summer, when plump blackberries are at their ripest. The boldly 
flavored, fragile fruits favor fennel, which has a lightly licoricey scent and taste—and grilling 
fennel really brings out that subtle aniseed flavor. And both fennel and blackberries can boast 
health-boosting properties: The former is great for digestion, while the latter is packed with vita-
mins C and K. A bonus: this shrub is relatively quick to make and is ready to use in just two weeks, 
so you won’t have to wait long to enjoy it.  In 1790, Dr. József Zwack, the royal physician to the Habsburg Court, developed a medicinal 
blend of forty herbs and spices intended to soothe the stomach and prevent illnesses of all sorts. 
This tonic-based apothecary liqueur is still produced today according to the same recipe. It calls for 
macerated and distilled herbs to be aged in specially sourced oak casks, which add color, flavor, and 
depth to this bitter Hungarian health tonic. Said to be a powerful detoxifier, Zwack is enjoyed both 
as an aperitif and a digestif, and it’s usually administered straight up and well chilled (according to 
some, adding ice would only dilute and weaken the effects of the potent liqueur). For the faint of 
heart, though, it can be mixed with ice and seltzer or tonic water: hence, the Habsburg Stomach 
Healer. Try to find a tonic water made with cane sugar; it’s far superior to the run-of-the-mill stuff.

Time: 2 weeks. Place the blackberries in a nonreactive bowl, 
and add the sugar. Mash the fruit and sugar together, then stir well and cover tightly. Leave to sit for 24 hours at room temperature. Then add the vinegar, fennel, and pink peppercorns. Stir well, cover tightly, and leave the mixture either in the fridge or at cellar temperature for 3–4 days. Then, place a strainer over another nonreactive bowl and transfer the mixture to the strainer. Press down on the fruit-vinegar mixture with the back of a wooden spoon to release as much liquid from the blackberries as possible. Discard the fruit pulp. Funnel the liquid into a sterilized bottle or jar. Store in the refrigerator for another week or two, shaking the jar daily to combine the flavors and mellow the vinegar.

INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Place the brown sugar cube into a champagne flute. Moisten with a 
few drops of my Raw Honey Aromatic Bitters. Then add the gin, the 
blackberry-fennel shrub, and top with some darned good champagne. 
Garnish with a single blackberry and a sprig of mint. Avoid having 
more than four of these little darlings at one go. You’ll thank me later.AS WE APPROACHED SAINT-DENIS
The classic French 75. As We Approached Saint-Denis is a delicious, 
elegant cocktail—try serving a round of them to a bunch of thirsty (and slightly 
bleary-eyed?) folks right before a leisurely warm-weather lunch—but even I 
have to confess that it’s pretty hard to improve upon the traditional version. To highlight the drink’s powerful kick, it’s named for the 75-millimeter M1897, a 
French gun used in the First World War. Like its namesake, the original French 
75 is hardly light fare: It involves combining gin or brandy, simple syrup, lemon 
juice, and champagne over a whack of cracked ice. If you have more than 
two—well, don’t say that I didn’t warn you. Enough said. SIDENOTE

Shrub instead. As We Approached Saint-Denis tips its hat to the bushes full of sumptuous fruit 
that line the roadways near the French town of the same name. 
Place the brown sugar cube into a champagne flute. Moisten with a 
few drops of my Raw Honey Aromatic Bitters. Then add the gin, the 
blackberry-fennel shrub, and top with some darned good champagne. 
Garnish with a single blackberry and a sprig of mint. Avoid having 
more than four of these little darlings at one go. You’ll thank me later.AS WE APPROACHED SAINT-DENIS
The classic French 75. As We Approached Saint-Denis is a delicious, 
elegant cocktail—try serving a round of them to a bunch of thirsty (and slightly 
bleary-eyed?) folks right before a leisurely warm-weather lunch—but even I 
have to confess that it’s pretty hard to improve upon the traditional version. To highlight the drink’s powerful kick, it’s named for the 75-millimeter M1897, a 
French gun used in the First World War. Like its namesake, the original French 
75 is hardly light fare: It involves combining gin or brandy, simple syrup, lemon 
juice, and champagne over a whack of cracked ice. If you have more than 
two—well, don’t say that I didn’t warn you. Enough said.

TEA LIQUEUR
_ CRUSHED ICE
_ 2 TABLESPOONS (30 ML) ROSE-INFUSED  
SIMPLE SYRUP (SEE PAGE 313)
_ FOUR DROPS THAI BITTERSRhubarb has been used in folk medicine for thousands of years, and, legend has it, first arrived 
in the United States when Benjamin Franklin brought rhubarb seeds from Europe in the late 
eighteenth century. Famed for its powerful purgative qualities, rhubarb has been known to ease 
blockages of the digestive tract that may stem from poor diet. (And it’s rich in vitamin C and 
potassium, too.) In its incarnation as a liqueur, it’s a delicious way to relax stomachs on the fritz. 
Sure to summon up memories of late summers long past, this grown-up slushy puts rhubarb 
liqueur into the limelight, combining it with a delicately fragrant simple syrup infused with rose. 
A dash of bitters tops off this restorative cocktail. 
INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Pack a Collins glass with the crushed ice. Pour the rhubarb 
tea liqueur and rose-infused simple syrup over it. Mix well 
with a bar spoon until combined. Add the Thai bitters. The 
result will be a fantastically icy, slushy concoction—hence 
the name—that’s best served with a spoon and a straw.  RHUBARB SLUSHY

(Text)_ 3 OUNCES (90 ML) CHARTREUSE VEP  
_ 1 OUNCE (25 ML) DRY VERMOUTH_ 1 EGG WHITE_ 2 TO 3 SAFFRON THREADSThis mood-lifting prescriptive combines top-quality chartreuse with vermouth and egg white for 
a colorful, frothy little cocktail that’ll brighten up even the greyest day. Try one after lunch, and 
top it off with a thread or two of saffron as a nod to Chartreuse’s luscious color. 
INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Add the chartreuse, vermouth, and egg white to a Boston 
Shaker; then fill the shaker three-quarters full with ice. 
Shake vigorously for twenty seconds until frothy. Strain 
the mixture into a coupé glass, and garnish with the 
saffron. Then sit back and watch sinking spirits rise.   CHARTREUSE CURATIVE 
Saffron’s strengths. Chartreuse has saffron to thank for its trademark 
bright-yellow hue. Derived from the crocus flower, this precious spice has long 
been praised for its healing qualities: It’s reputed to be an antiseptic, antide-
pressant, antioxidant, a digestive aid, and an anti-convulsion restorative. It was probably used in Ayurvedic medicine and Asian and Mediterranean cooking for 
thousands of years before it made its way to France, where it’s showcased in the production of herbal liqueurs like Chartreuse, which French imbibers enjoy 
as an after-dinner drink. (If you’d like to use saffron in your cooking, don’t be 
put off by the price. Yes, it’s astronomically expensive, but never fear: As with most good things, a little goes a very long way.) SIDENOTE

(OR ORGANIC ROOT BEER)
_ ICE CUBES (OPTIONAL)Underberg is a powerfully healing herbal tonic that hails from Germany. Buy a bottle and you’ll 
see that the slogan on the label reads, “After a good meal.”  True to its word, Underberg is a 
highly effective cure after overindulging in both food and drink. Serious imbibers keep a bottle 
or three handy for medicinal purposes—you never know when you might need it. Underberg 
can be enjoyed neat or mixed with tomato juice for a German take on the Bloody Mary. The 
Underberg Settler, created by world-famous Seattle mixologist Rocky Yeh, also features aromatic 
bitters, which were as commonplace on the shelves of early apothecaries as aspirin is today. Like 
Underberg itself, aromatic bitters add a punch to the dark rum that helps settle the belly and perk 
up the brain. 
INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Combine all liquid ingredients in a mixing glass and stir. Add ice 
if desired, and strain into highball glasses. Rinse and repeat if 
necessary until that hangover disappears. UNDERBERG SETTLER

necessary until that hangover disappears. UNDERBERG SETTLER

(Text)SMALL WHITE BLOSSOM 
The Small White Blossom is my Cocktail Whisperer’s take on the classic New Orleans–style 
Kentucky Whiskey cocktail, which calls for only two ingredients: bourbon and pineapple juice. 
As usual, I take things a bit further. My version uses craft whiskey made from millet, not bourbon. 
Its toasted-almond and caramel flavors are a great match for fresh fruit juices. Here, grilled 
pineapple juice combined with freshly squeezed orange juice gives the Blossom an extra layer of 
flavor, while a splash of club soda and the tiniest pinch of sea salt add a refreshing, palate-tickling 
lift. If you can find it, make your simple syrup with gum arabic (also spelled “gomme arabic”), 
which yields a lush, creamy mouth feel. The result: A cocktail that’s small, but perfectly formed.

Add the pinch of sea salt over the top to finish. Alternative-grain whiskeys. Thanks to the rising popularity 
of distilling with alternative, artisan grains, whiskeymakers have more 
raw materials to work with than ever before. (And, even more importantly, 
the arcane laws forbidding any kind of distilling at all have been changed 
in many states, so that distillers can actually get on with the job.) Sure, 
producers both large and small are still creating excellent spirits from corn, 
wheat, or barley—those venerable whiskey-friendly grains. But alternative 
grains offer craft distillers new ways to shine. This is great news for the 
discerning drinker, for it means that she has a whole new world of whiskeys 
at her fingertips, including millet whiskey, quinoa whiskey, oat whiskey, 
hopped whiskey, and spelt whiskey. 
Gluten- and wheat-free foods like these grains are all the rage these days: 
They’re not just for celiacs anymore. Quinoa, for example, has enjoyed a 
huge spike in popularity. It’s a good source of complete protein, and it’s 
super-versatile (try replacing couscous with quinoa in just about any 
recipe—it’s delicious). Indigenous to South America, it has a toasty, deeply 
earthy flavor when distilled. And oats aren’t just for breakfast: They’re being 
transformed into whiskeys that are full of rich, creamy, caramel-vanilla fla-
vors. Then there’s spelt: In the kitchen, it’s often made into celiac-friendly 
baked goods, but in the distillery, it becomes a whiskey that can be redolent 
of yummy things like apples, warm brown sugar, or shortbread. But some 
craft distillers think millet makes the best whiskey of all, producing a spirit 
with a sweet, nutty taste. While whiskeys made from alternative grains 
don’t come cheap due to the expense of using artisan ingredients, they’re 
worth the extra money, since they make truly memorable cocktails.SIDENOTEDIGESTIVES & AFTER-DINNER DRINKS •

laced with the Turkish liqueur raki, and it’s a great way to calm cranky bellies. Rose-infused 
simple syrup adds a hint of sweetness to take the bitter edge off the raki, and a splash of soda 
water makes the Bosphorus Cocktail remarkably refreshing and stimulating. Sherry has been suspected of curative powers for centuries. In days of yore, pharmacists often 
prescribed it as a nerve tonic, or as an antidote to insomnia. Sherry was also used as a suspension 
for herbal tinctures, powders, and fresh herbs and fruits. Sherry “punches” made with stone fruits 
are a delicious way to nip that bad mood in the bud, especially if it was brought on by a touch 
of indigestion. And here’s another reason to treat yourself to a Sherry–Cherry Cobbler: Stone

if you like!) Serve, sip, and float away on a cherry-flavored cloud.  DIGESTIVES & AFTER-DINNER DRINKS •

_ 4 OUNCES (120 ML) GINGER  
BEER (NON-ALCOHOLIC)
_ LIME WEDGE FOR GARNISHIn the heyday of apothecaries, medicines usually tasted terrible, and weren’t often prettied up 
through the addition of sweeteners or coloring, as they are today. So, as the song goes, a spoonful 
of ginger could truly help the medicine go down. Alternatively, ginger itself could be used as 
medicine, since it’s said to be an effective cure for a variety of ailments, including headaches, 
motion sickness, fatigue, and pregnancy-related nausea. Ginger, a close relative of turmeric and 
cardamom, appears in many forms, including powders, syrups, suspensions, tonics, salves, and 
infusions, and traditional Chinese medicine is rife with the healing root. Combining ginger with 
hot punches or beer is a classic way to use the root as a curative, as sailors of yesteryear would have 
known. Named after the honorable doctor in Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic, Treasure Island, 
this cocktail matches ginger beer with its natural partner, rum, into a tipple that rouses the mood 
and washes the doldrums away. 
INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Fill a Collins glass with ice cubes. Pour the ginger beer over the ice; 
then float the dark rum on top. Garnish with a lime wedge to keep 
scurvy at bay. DOCTOR LIVESEY’S COCKTAIL

(Text)COLONIAL SOUR CHERRY SHRUB
George Washington himself would have agreed that cherries are treasured ingredients when it 
comes to shrubs. Alas, the growing season is quite short, so if you miss the all-too-brief sour 
cherry season at your local farm market, never fear: all is not lost. It’s easy to make a sour cherry 
shrub in a hurry if you have a jar of sour cherry preserves on hand. (And you don’t have to tell a soul that you cut corners.) Using preserves means you won’t have to reduce the fruits over heat; 
that’s already been done for you. This shrub is ready to use in just 36 hours. Or, you can continue to age it in the fridge for up to a month.
_ 1 8 OUNCE (235-ML) JAR OF  
SOUR CHERRY PRESERVES
_ 1 CUP (200 G) DEMERARA SUGAR
_ 1 CUP (235 ML) APPLE CIDER VINEGARINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Time: 36 hours. Place the sour cherry preserves in a nonreactive 
bowl, and cover with the sugar. Let them steep together for at least 
overnight (or for a few days) at room temperature. Then strain the 
cherry mixture through a nonreactive sieve, crushing the tender 
fruits with a wooden spoon to extract as much flavor and sweet 
juice as possible. Combine with the vinegar; let the mixture sit for 
a few hours, and then strain and bottle in sterilized bottles. Use the 
shrub right away, or let it sit in the fridge for three weeks to a month.   THE BENJAMIN GUNN MYSTERY COCKTAIL
Named for a former crewman of pirate captain J. Flint in Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic novel 
Treasure Island, this cocktail is an homage to Ben Gunn, a sailor who finds himself marooned on 
Treasure Island for several years. In the end, though, he discovers Captain Flint’s treasure—and 
you’ll feel as lucky as Gunn did when you treat yourself to one of these ambrosial tipples. Rich, 
jammy Colonial Sour Cherry Shrub marries well with oak-aged dark rum: then, a splash of maple 
syrup sweetens the deal. Finish with a little seltzer water plus a few dabs of medicinal bitters for a 
cocktail that’s sure to soothe even the touchiest of tummies.

(Text)THE JIMMY GILLESPIE FIZZ
A CIGAR DIVAN ON RUPERT STREETIt’s easy to showcase the depth of flavor inherent in bitters. The key? Simplicity. When you add 
a dash of your favorite bitters to a glass of spirits mixed with seltzer water, you’ll find that all the 
heavy lifting has been done for you. Take, for example, the Jimmy Gillespie Fizz, named after 
a dear friend of mine from Swan’s Island, Maine. He was one-of-a kind: an old codger from 
another generation. Jimmy loved his Scotch, and he inducted me into the pleasures of drinking 
fine, single-malt Scotch whisky with as few embellishments as possible: except, perhaps, a tiny bit 
of his brackish-tasting well water alongside the whisky, or maybe a few dashes of bitters. Bitters, 
he claimed, healed the belly, although I suspect he was more partial to their astringent taste—and 
their alcohol content.  That was Jimmy for you.
Back in the day, New York City’s far Upper West Side was elegance itself. This cocktail takes 
its name from an imaginary shop that could have made its home there, since the cigar divan 
itself was a symbol of moneyed leisure. Drinkers would have whiled the hours away in such an 
establishment on a low chair (or divan), cigar and cocktail in hand and the world at their feet. 
These days, mixing yourself a Cigar Divan on Rupert Street is an artful, refreshing way to pep 
up the appetite and prep your belly for a leisurely evening meal. It combines Tennessee whiskey’s 
inimitable smokiness with a dash of fresh citrus juice, handcrafted bitters, and cane-sugar cola 
for a tipple that’s for grown-ups only. (Try not to resort to big-name colas made with corn 
syrup—the quality of the ingredients makes all the difference.) _ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) SCOTCH WHISKY

(Text)THE JIMMY GILLESPIE FIZZ
A CIGAR DIVAN ON RUPERT STREETIt’s easy to showcase the depth of flavor inherent in bitters. The key? Simplicity. When you add 
a dash of your favorite bitters to a glass of spirits mixed with seltzer water, you’ll find that all the 
heavy lifting has been done for you. Take, for example, the Jimmy Gillespie Fizz, named after 
a dear friend of mine from Swan’s Island, Maine. He was one-of-a kind: an old codger from 
another generation. Jimmy loved his Scotch, and he inducted me into the pleasures of drinking 
fine, single-malt Scotch whisky with as few embellishments as possible: except, perhaps, a tiny bit 
of his brackish-tasting well water alongside the whisky, or maybe a few dashes of bitters. Bitters, 
he claimed, healed the belly, although I suspect he was more partial to their astringent taste—and 
their alcohol content.  That was Jimmy for you.
Back in the day, New York City’s far Upper West Side was elegance itself. This cocktail takes 
its name from an imaginary shop that could have made its home there, since the cigar divan 
itself was a symbol of moneyed leisure. Drinkers would have whiled the hours away in such an 
establishment on a low chair (or divan), cigar and cocktail in hand and the world at their feet. 
These days, mixing yourself a Cigar Divan on Rupert Street is an artful, refreshing way to pep 
up the appetite and prep your belly for a leisurely evening meal. It combines Tennessee whiskey’s 
inimitable smokiness with a dash of fresh citrus juice, handcrafted bitters, and cane-sugar cola 
for a tipple that’s for grown-ups only. (Try not to resort to big-name colas made with corn

they knew what to do with. That’s where shrub-making would have come in: A farmer’s wife 
would have “put up” plenty of a cherry-based shrub to preserve the essence of summery cher-
ries for the long winter months ahead. A speedily-made cherry shrub is great in cocktails. It

an elegant riff on the Irish coffee, and since it’s served chilled, it’s perfect for summer evenings 
when you’re dying for a digestif, but can’t stand the thought of hot liquids. In it, French whisky 
meets chilled espresso, black walnut bitters, a dash of club soda, and a dollop of easy-to-make, 
cognac-spiked whipped cream—along with a little freshly grated nutmeg for good measure. (Feel 
free to prepare the espresso well in advance—even the day before is fine.) Serve it alongside (or 
after) a simple, light dessert, like fresh berries over cognac-laced vanilla ice cream—or, with a few 
good shortbread cookies. 
INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Brew your espresso and let it cool either in an ice bath or overnight 
in the fridge.
Add several large cubes of ice to each of two Collins glasses. Top 
each with 1 ounce (30 ml) of the chilled espresso in each glass, 
followed by the French whisky. Splash a bit of club soda on top of 
each drink, then spoon the sweetened, thick cream over the mixture. 
Scrape a little fresh nutmeg over the top of each glass, and finish 
each with 4 drops of bitters. Serves 2 thirsty heads. In the immortal

(Text)RED BERRY DESSERT GASTRIQUE
This fruit-laden gastrique is so simple to make that you can hardly call it a recipe—but I just had 
to include it here, since it’s one of my favorite ways to pull dessert together in an instant. My Red 
Berry Dessert Gastrique is a foolproof way to gussy up just about anything sweet, from flourless 
chocolate cake to fresh fruit to plain old vanilla ice cream. Even though it’s made from pureed 
red berries, I like to drizzle it over more fresh, whole red berries—strawberries, raspberries, 
whatever’s in season—for a healthy finish to a warm-weather meal, like sautéed salmon filets 
with a simple green salad. And, in case you’re having trouble finding it, pomegranate vinegar is 
available in most Middle Eastern or Asian markets.
_ 1 CUP (200 G) RAW CANE SUGAR
_ 1/2 CUP (120 ML)  
POMEGRANATE VINEGAR
_ 1 CUP (150 G) PUREED RED  
FRUITS, SUCH AS STRAWBERRIES,  
RASPBERRIES, AND/OR CHERRIESINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, 
then reduce the heat and simmer for 10–20 minutes, or until the 
mixture has reached the desired thickness. Strain the fruit mixture, 
and let cool. To serve, place a couple handfuls of fresh, assorted 
red berries into a small glass bowl or martini glass. Drizzle the 
gastrique over the berries, and serve to your very, very happy 
guests. If you’re a chocoholic—and who isn’t? —you can serve it 
alongside homemade brownies. Or, melt a couple tablespoons of 
good-quality dark chocolate, and spoon it over the berries. Simple!

it’s time to bring them into the kitchen. Allow me to introduce to you to 
the classic French sauce known as a gastrique. Its very name may sound 
ultra-elegant and sophisticated, but at the end of the day, a gastrique is 
simply a shrub that’s produced in the kitchen over heat, and the process isn’t 
a difficult one. Like shrubs, gastriques are combinations of vinegar, sugar, 
fruit, vegetables (or other flavorings), and they’re usually combined in a 
saucepan and slowly reduced over heat until they become thick, concentrated, 
intensely flavored, sweet-tart syrups. (Unlike shrubs, you won’t have to wait 
days or weeks for them to mature: about an hour is all it takes.) Then, the 
luscious syrup that comprises a gastrique is added to a dish as a finishing 
sauce—often to complement the simple, delicate, understated flavors of 
fresh food. It adds texture, fragrance, acidity, and intensity to everything from 
pan-sautéed chicken or pork to grilled fish to fresh berries, French toast, and 
vanilla ice cream. Adding a few drops of a well-made gastrique to just about 
any dish can excite your palate in a big way. 
Over the years, I’ve experimented with all sorts of ingredients when I’m 
making gastriques—including peaches, apples, espresso coffee, curry 
powder, baking spices, plums, leeks, fresh peas, and tomatoes. But they all 
have one thing in common: their simplicity. Gastriques, like my Red Berry 
Dessert Gastrique and my Coffee Gastrique for Vanilla Gelato, really are a 
snap to make, and you don’t have to be a culinary genius to put them together. 
Honestly, if you can boil water, you can make a gastrique. The main ingre-
dient? A little patience, since it takes about an hour for the sauce to reduce down to a nice, viscous thickness. Welcome to your new favorite condiment! SIDENOTEDIGESTIVES & AFTER-DINNER DRINKS •

(Text)COFFEE GASTRIQUE FOR VANILLA GELATOTHE VENDETTA COCKTAIL 
Good news for the sweet-toothed: Gastriques can take the form of a luscious, dessert-friendly 
sauce that’ll have your guests coming back for second—and even third, or, heaven help us, 
fourth!—helpings. Given the chance, gelato is a most welcome recipient for the concentrated fla-
vors inherent in a gastrique, and for its trademark sweet-and-tangy finish. My Coffee Gastrique 
combines strong, cold coffee with a dose of maple sugar and a hint of apple cider vinegar. After 
letting the mixture reduce slowly, you’ll have an intensely flavored finishing sauce that’ll charm 
the socks off coffee-lovers everywhere. Serve it over the best-quality vanilla ice cream or gelato 
you can get your hands on for a simple but stunning finale to just about any meal.The inspiration for the Vendetta Cocktail comes from a walk I took through Brooklyn recently. 
So many of Brooklyn’s turn-of-the-century buildings have been demolished, and so many visible 
memories of the borough’s past have been erased during its transformation into the hipster 
paradise it is today. And it’s a huge loss. In order to honor Brooklyn’s past, I wanted to combine 
ingredients from the old neighborhood delis such as Manhattan Special Espresso Coffee Soda 
and vanilla gelato  to create this boozy take on the traditional Italian dessert affogato, which 
involves pouring freshly pulled espresso over vanilla ice cream. I like to muddle a few home-
cured cocktail cherries into my Vendetta; they help to smooth the smoked whiskey’s bold taste.

_ 12 OUNCES (355 ML) CLUB SODA  _ ICE CUBESStrawberry and rhubarb, that classic combination of sweet and tart, are winners when it comes to 
summery desserts—and what’s more, rhubarb has been prescribed as a curative for hundreds of 
years thanks to its purgative, diuretic effects. That’s why this cocktail makes an especially luscious 
digestif. Try it after a long, lazy summer lunch. 
INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Add the strawberry and rhubarb mixture, rum, and ice to a glass 
beaker, and mix well with the swizzle stick. (The faster you 
swizzle, the better! Moving the swizzle stick quickly ensures that 
the liquids and solids in the drink are thoroughly combined.) Strain 
the mixture into two coupé glasses, top with club soda, and use the 
swizzle stick as garnish, if desired. Then kick back and let the tart, 
refreshing fizz chill you out. Serves 2.  RHUBARB AND STRAWBERRY SWIZZLE 
The story of the swizzle. It’s hardly used in common parlance these 
days, but back in the day, a “swizzle” could refer to any drink made with rum, 
topped up with water or other mixers and flavored with a range of botanicals, 
and served over ice. According to legend, such drinks were mixed or stirred 
with roots or twigs—history’s very first “swizzle sticks.” (If you ask me, though, 
the rock candy swizzle stick in my recipe tastes just a little bit nicer, and adds 
the perfect amount of sweetness to the mix!) Some say that the ancestral 
home of swizzles is the Caribbean islands, so to keep things authentic, see if 
you can search out Rhum Agricole, a type of rum distilled from sugar cane in 
the West Indian island of Martinique. There, “kill-devil” was used in traditional 
curatives—but don’t worry, if you can’t find Rhum Agricole, any good quality 
spiced rum will do.  SIDENOTE

_ 3 OUNCES (90 ML) IRISH WHISKEY_ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) HOME MADE  
WHIPPED CREAM (SEE PAGE 312)
_ 1/4 OUNCE (7 ML) ABSINTHEThis exotic hot drink is a layered cocktail, based on the pousse-café, a cocktail in which several 
different kinds of liquor are carefully layered on top of one another. Where the pousse-café is 
served cold, however, the Café Irlandés is served piping hot. It’s a combination of strong, hot 
coffee; sweet, thick whipped cream; and perky, spicy Irish whiskey. And it’s impossible to make 
without softly made, hand-whipped cream. (Whatever you do, never use that stuff that comes in a 
can. See page 312 for an easy recipe for whipped cream.) The kind of whipped cream that makes 
this drink sing is more like a thickly textured emulsion that sticks to the sides of the glass when 
poured. The result is a magical concoction that’s digestif and dessert all in one. Try not to have 
more than two: Otherwise, you’ll be caught in a tug-of-war between the caffeine and the alcohol.  
INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Preheat a strong wineglass or latte-style coffee glass by filling 
it with boiling water, and then pour the water out. Add the 
sugar and about a third of the coffee, and stir with a bar 
spoon. Then add about a third of the whiskey, by pouring it 
over the back of a dessert spoon into the glass. Then spoon 
some cream into the glass, followed by a bit more sugar, and 
a bit more whiskey. Repeat the process until you’ve used up all whiskey, sugar, and coffee. (Work slowly; it’s an art form, 
not a race!) Finally, using a medicine dropper (or extreme 
care), drip the absinthe over the top of the cocktail. Sláinte! CAFÉ IRLANDÉS

(Text)LAST NIGHT, YOU WENT OUT FOR A COUPLE OF DRINKS. YOU STARTED ON THE EARLY SIDE,  
KICKING THINGS OFF WITH A FEW G&TS CIRCA FIVE P .M.—THEN MOVED ON TO DINNER,  COMPLETE WITH WINE (RED AND  WHITE). OF COURSE, DESSERT WAS COMPULSORY, NOT  
TO MENTION THE IRISH COFFEE YOU ORDERED IN A MOMENT OF OPTIMISM, PLUS THE  
COMPLIMENTARY COGNAC DELIVERED WITH A FLOURISH BY A SMILING WAITER AT THE END  OF THE MEAL. AND AFTER THAT, THE WHOLE GANG DECIDED THAT THE EVENING WOULDN’T  BE COMPLETE UNTIL YOU ALL WENT TO THE PUB ACROSS THE STREET FOR A NIGHTCAP .O y vey. What you’re afflicted with this morning can’t really be called a hangover: that’s too 
kind a word. It’s more like you’ve been trampled by a herd of oxen, and spat on by a crowd 
of angry goats. Your head hurts so badly it’s practically hopping off your shoulders; your 
stomach’s a mess; and you’re filled with an exhaustion so profound that you’re certain you’ll Never 
Ever Drink Again. 
 That’s okay. If you needed a little help lifting your head from your pillow this morning, you’ve 
come to the right place. Hangovers are as old as time, which is why a lot of the best cures have their 
roots in the past. Apothecaries and pharmacists of previous centuries would have been called upon 
to provide quick, effective remedies for client who were, ahem, feeling poorly after an evening’s 
entertainment—and relief often came in the form of restorative herbs, spices, and citrus fruits that 
could be combined with a little hair of the dog (or not) in order to perk up the senses and lighten 
the heart after a late night. These curative cocktails would have taken many forms: fizzes, which 
cool and refresh the palate as they calm the belly; short, strong drinks that could be sipped quickly, 
for rapid healing; citrusy concoctions for much-needed rehydration (not to mention a blast of 
vitamin C); and effervescent cola-based beverages, which offer doses of caffeine, sugar, and spirits 
all at once, to name but a few. And of course all of the above would be topped off by liberal dashes 
of medicinal bitters, which have been used to mitigate all manner of maladies for hundreds of 
years. Most importantly, though, any cocktail meant to lift the spirit after a difficult night out on 
the town should be enticing both to the nose and the eyes—and it never hurts to serve restorative 
cocktails in a tall glass with plenty of ice.
 So what’s your poison? There’s a lot to choose from in this chapter. Pharmacists of old often 
prescribed tonics including lighter spirits such as gin, white rum, or vodka to heal debilitating 
hangovers, as in my Askew Bloody Mary—or, they may have suggested the simple combination of homemade, healing bitters and soda water, served over ice in a tall glass: Witness my Angostura and 
Seltzer Restorative, which is still delicious—and effective—today. Then there are herbal liqueurs 
like Fernet Branca and Branca Menta, which comprise nothing less than divine intervention for 
hangovers when they’re mixed with cane-sugar cola. Extract of milk thistle has been used to heal vehement hangovers for centuries, due to its natural liver-healing qualities, so a Milk Thistle 
Spritz is a great way to start your detox stat. But if you truly feel like the undead after an evening 
of debauchery, reach for a cognac-heavy Corpse Reviver: it’s sure to bring you back to the land of 
the living. So read on, and start mixing: Even the most stubborn hangover is no match for these 
rejuvenating craft cocktails.RESTORATIVE DRINKS FOR THE

(Text)LAST NIGHT, YOU WENT OUT FOR A COUPLE OF DRINKS. YOU STARTED ON THE EARLY SIDE,  
KICKING THINGS OFF WITH A FEW G&TS CIRCA FIVE P .M.—THEN MOVED ON TO DINNER,  COMPLETE WITH WINE (RED AND  WHITE). OF COURSE, DESSERT WAS COMPULSORY, NOT  
TO MENTION THE IRISH COFFEE YOU ORDERED IN A MOMENT OF OPTIMISM, PLUS THE  
COMPLIMENTARY COGNAC DELIVERED WITH A FLOURISH BY A SMILING WAITER AT THE END  OF THE MEAL. AND AFTER THAT, THE WHOLE GANG DECIDED THAT THE EVENING WOULDN’T  BE COMPLETE UNTIL YOU ALL WENT TO THE PUB ACROSS THE STREET FOR A NIGHTCAP .O y vey. What you’re afflicted with this morning can’t really be called a hangover: that’s too 
kind a word. It’s more like you’ve been trampled by a herd of oxen, and spat on by a crowd 
of angry goats. Your head hurts so badly it’s practically hopping off your shoulders; your 
stomach’s a mess; and you’re filled with an exhaustion so profound that you’re certain you’ll Never 
Ever Drink Again. 
 That’s okay. If you needed a little help lifting your head from your pillow this morning, you’ve 
come to the right place. Hangovers are as old as time, which is why a lot of the best cures have their 
roots in the past. Apothecaries and pharmacists of previous centuries would have been called upon 
to provide quick, effective remedies for client who were, ahem, feeling poorly after an evening’s 
entertainment—and relief often came in the form of restorative herbs, spices, and citrus fruits that 
could be combined with a little hair of the dog (or not) in order to perk up the senses and lighten 
the heart after a late night. These curative cocktails would have taken many forms: fizzes, which 
cool and refresh the palate as they calm the belly; short, strong drinks that could be sipped quickly, 
for rapid healing; citrusy concoctions for much-needed rehydration (not to mention a blast of 
vitamin C); and effervescent cola-based beverages, which offer doses of caffeine, sugar, and spirits 
all at once, to name but a few. And of course all of the above would be topped off by liberal dashes 
of medicinal bitters, which have been used to mitigate all manner of maladies for hundreds of 
years. Most importantly, though, any cocktail meant to lift the spirit after a difficult night out on 
the town should be enticing both to the nose and the eyes—and it never hurts to serve restorative 
cocktails in a tall glass with plenty of ice.
 So what’s your poison? There’s a lot to choose from in this chapter. Pharmacists of old often 
prescribed tonics including lighter spirits such as gin, white rum, or vodka to heal debilitating 
hangovers, as in my Askew Bloody Mary—or, they may have suggested the simple combination of homemade, healing bitters and soda water, served over ice in a tall glass: Witness my Angostura and 
Seltzer Restorative, which is still delicious—and effective—today. Then there are herbal liqueurs 
like Fernet Branca and Branca Menta, which comprise nothing less than divine intervention for 
hangovers when they’re mixed with cane-sugar cola. Extract of milk thistle has been used to heal vehement hangovers for centuries, due to its natural liver-healing qualities, so a Milk Thistle 
Spritz is a great way to start your detox stat. But if you truly feel like the undead after an evening 
of debauchery, reach for a cognac-heavy Corpse Reviver: it’s sure to bring you back to the land of 
the living. So read on, and start mixing: Even the most stubborn hangover is no match for these 
rejuvenating craft cocktails.RESTORATIVE DRINKS FOR THE

(Text)FERNET BRANCA AND COLA
APEROL FIZZWhen it comes to mangia e beve, few cultures can surpass the delights of Italy. And there’s little 
better for healing a truly headbanging hangover than a nip of the Italian herbal liqueur Fernet 
Branca, which sports an assertive, even bitter flavor that’s truly inimitable. This historic cocktail 
actually hails from Argentina, where Fernet Branca remains popular with the families of Italian 
immigrants who left their homeland during World War II. I know you’re feeling delicate, but don’t 
be afraid of Fernet’s bitter edge: When served in a cocktail alongside cane-sugar cola, this deeply 
engaging elixir goes down remarkably smoothly. The body-warming alcohol levels of the liqueur 
also play a role in the intense flavor of the naturally sourced herbs and spices. Fernet Branca is 
delicious when taken ice cold, as is the custom in Argentina and San Francisco—and cool liquids 
can’t help but soothe self-induced aches and pains, like throbbing noggins and parched tongues. 
Historically, the citrusy Italian aperitif Aperol has been enjoyed before, during and after lengthy 
meals to perk up appetites and ease digestion. Aperol gently raises the spirits as well as the 
appetite, especially when combined with aromatic bitters and fizzy water. It’s just the thing if 
your spirits need a lift the day after a marathon meal—or a liquid lunch!—with good friends. 
This historic cocktail was created to get tired bellies back on track, and it’s so easy to make. Plus, 
since it’s relatively low in alcohol, the Aperol Fizz is a sensible drink, so you’ll be less likely to 
overindulge (again). It’s the quick fix your digestive system needs!_ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) FERNET BRANCA
_ ICE CUBES
_ 4 OUNCES (120 ML) CANE-SUGAR

Pour the measure of Fernet Branca over a handful of ice 
cubes in a tall Collins glass. Top with the cane-sugar 
cola, and add a chunk or two of lime to give the immune 
system a boost (it rarely hurts to add citrus to curative 
cocktails). Your stomach—and head—will thank you.

(Text)PEPPERY FENNEL FIZZ ANGOSTURA AND SELTZER WATER RESTORATIVE
All right. The fact is, you’re not feeling so well this morning. You had a few drinks with the guys 
from work last night, usually a tame affair that has you home by nine at the latest. Last night, 
however, your first drink was a shot of Sambuca—at the shockingly early hour of six-thirty—and 
things went straight downhill after that. Well, sufferer, meet my simple Angostura and Seltzer 
Water Restorative, which is the way to mitigate the gruesome effects of a night out on the tiles. 
It’s so easy it can hardly be called a recipe—but I had to include it here for its sheer effectiveness. 
Both seltzer water and bitters are famous for their ability to subdue unruly bellies. Consuming 
them both at once is, to use the technical term, a double whammy of a cure. Take two, and call 
me in the morning. 
There’s nothing better than a multi-course meal with friends, complete with coffee, dessert, and 
nightcaps. (Lots of nightcaps.) Of course, your stomach won’t always thank you the next day. 
That’s where our friend fennel comes in. It’s often used as a diuretic, and is said to remedy 
digestive malaises of all kinds—plus, it’s a powerfully purifying, detoxifying vegetable. Happily, 
it’s simple to whip up a cleansing, refreshing cocktail featuring fennel that peps up your palate 
as well as your belly. Here, fennel syrup is combined with raki, the anise-based Turkish spirit, 
along with chile flakes, which jolt taste buds back to life (and if the chile makes you sweat a bit, 
so much the better.)  And the effervescence in a dose of seltzer water helps to settle overworked stomachs, too. _ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) FERNET BRANCA

(Text)PEPPERY FENNEL FIZZ ANGOSTURA AND SELTZER WATER RESTORATIVE
All right. The fact is, you’re not feeling so well this morning. You had a few drinks with the guys 
from work last night, usually a tame affair that has you home by nine at the latest. Last night, 
however, your first drink was a shot of Sambuca—at the shockingly early hour of six-thirty—and 
things went straight downhill after that. Well, sufferer, meet my simple Angostura and Seltzer 
Water Restorative, which is the way to mitigate the gruesome effects of a night out on the tiles. 
It’s so easy it can hardly be called a recipe—but I had to include it here for its sheer effectiveness. 
Both seltzer water and bitters are famous for their ability to subdue unruly bellies. Consuming 
them both at once is, to use the technical term, a double whammy of a cure. Take two, and call 
me in the morning. 
There’s nothing better than a multi-course meal with friends, complete with coffee, dessert, and 
nightcaps. (Lots of nightcaps.) Of course, your stomach won’t always thank you the next day. 
That’s where our friend fennel comes in. It’s often used as a diuretic, and is said to remedy 
digestive malaises of all kinds—plus, it’s a powerfully purifying, detoxifying vegetable. Happily, 
it’s simple to whip up a cleansing, refreshing cocktail featuring fennel that peps up your palate 
as well as your belly. Here, fennel syrup is combined with raki, the anise-based Turkish spirit, 
along with chile flakes, which jolt taste buds back to life (and if the chile makes you sweat a bit, 
so much the better.)  And the effervescence in a dose of seltzer water helps to settle overworked stomachs, too. _ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) FERNET BRANCA
_ 6 OUNCES (175 ML) COOL  
SELTZER WATER
_ 1 TEASPOON OF ANGOSTURA  
BITTERS (THINK TWICE  
BEFORE SUBSTITUTING MY  
COCKTAIL WHISPERER’S RAW  
HONEY AROMATIC BITTERS:  
THEY HAVE QUITE A KICK!)  
_ 1 PINCH SEA SALT
_ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) RAKI OR ABSINTHE  
_ 1 OUNCE (25 ML) FENNEL SIMPLE  
SYRUP (SEE PAGE 311)  
_ 1/4 TEASPOON DRIED CHILE FLAKES  
_ 1 TEASPOON ORANGE BITTERS
_ 4 OUNCES (120 ML) SELTZER WATERINGREDIENTS

Place a spear of hand-cut ice in a Collins glass. Top with the seltzer 
water, add the bitters, and finish with a quick sprinkle of sea salt.

SQUEEZED GRAPEFRUIT JUICE  
_ 1/2 OUNCE (15 ML) ABSINTHE_ LARGE PIECE OF LEMON PEEL
_ 1 ORANGE ZEST TWISTThe Iberville Cocktail, a tasty variation on the Sazerac theme, is equally as effective as dispersing 
disorders of the belly—especially ones that are self-induced. (Thank goodness for those healing 
Peychaud’s bitters, which, in days gone by, were even meant to ease the symptoms of more serious 
diseases such as dysentery and ulcers.) Mix yourself an Iberville, and sip it with the lights off.  
INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Add a couple handfuls of ice to a Boston shaker; then add the Lillet 
Blanc, brandy, bitters, and grapefruit juice, and shake well for 
twenty seconds. 
W ash a short rocks glass with the absinthe by pouring the 
absinthe into the glass, swirling it around, and pouring it out. 
Rub the inside of the washed glass thoroughly with the lemon 
peel. Strain the stomach-healing mixture into the glass, and 
garnish with a flamed orange zest twist (hold the orange twist 
firmly behind a lit match, and pinch it to release its natural 
citrus oils). Sip slowly for quick relief of uneasy stomachs.THE IBERVILLE STREET COCKTAIL 
Lillet Blanc is an aromatized wine—that is, a fortified wine featuring 
added herbs, spices, or other botanicals—that hails from Pondesac, a 
small village in the famous French wine region of Bordeaux. It’s com-
prised mostly of white Bordeaux wine with a small amount of added citrus 
liqueurs—and once upon a time it was also made with quinine (the same 
stuff that gives tonic water its bitter, refreshing edge), which can be used 
to treat malaria and fevers. Thanks to strategic advertising, Lillet Blanc 
became immensely popular in the 1920s and 1930s, especially with upper-
class Americans who sampled it on transatlantic liners on their way to 
and from Europe. These days quinine has disappeared from the recipe, 
and Lillet has a lighter, fresher taste, but it’s still delicious in cocktails 
like the Iberville Street, or in a Vesper Martini, a potent but terribly tasty 
combination of gin, vodka, and Lillet. SIDENOTE

(Text)THE FLEMING JENKINS FIZZ
The Fleming Jenkins Fizz is a variation on the ti’punch theme. Ferocious ti’punch has its origins 
in the Caribbean islands like Martinique, Guadeloupe, and Haiti, where rhum agricole was tra-
ditionally mixed with sugar-cane syrup and fresh lime juice for an aperitif that’s so potent, it’d 
knock more than just your socks off. I think Indian whisky, with its denser mouth feel, is really 
intriguing when it’s mixed with homemade simple syrup, absinthe, and club soda. It makes a 
smashing aperitif—and, equally, is a gentle way to take the edge off that hot-weather hangover.. 
It’s also a great accompaniment to a light, summery lunch like a salad of baby spinach, fresh 
mango, grilled chicken, sweet potato crisps, and cashew nuts. Don’t wait for warm weather to 
treat yourself to a Fleming Jenkins, though: All you need on hand is a good bottle of Indian 
whisky. The rest is easy.

glass. Add a splash of club soda and three drops of curried bitters, 
and serve immediately. Then start preparing round two!The rise of Indian whiskey. Since the 1980s, India, like Japan, has 
been giving Scotland a run for its money when it comes to the whisky making 
game. And that’s a bit of a surprise. Why? First of all, India is part of an equa-
torial climate zone, and its off-the-chart temperatures can be overwhelming 
to both humans and the production of distilled spirits. After all, whisky’s 
ancestral homes are Scotland and Ireland, where early producers distilled 
their liquor in climates far cooler than India’s—and for longer periods of time. 
In India (except, perhaps, in the far northern Himalayan Mountains where 
logistics make it impossible to distill whisky anyway), the temperature is hot 
for most of the year. That, coupled with the high humidity, makes the aging of 
whisky a far faster process than it would be in Europe. 
However, the final results are incredibly delicious. Indian distillers are begin-
ning to experiment with whiskies bottled at cask strength—a potent reminder 
that great whisky certainly doesn’t have to come from Scotland. A word of 
warning, though: Most Indian whisky isn’t actually made from grain. Instead, 
it’s often distilled from sugar cane or molasses, and is more of a flavored 
whisky substitute. The label on its bottle may hint at a fine Scottish heritage, 
but don’t be fooled: Be sure you’re buying grain-based Indian whisky when you 
invest in some. (Rum-based “whisky” of the lesser sort possesses all the stuff-ing to give you one of the most memorable hangovers of your life. Keep a large 
bottle of Fernet Branca handy for any such experiments into foolhardiness.)  SIDENOTEHANGOVER HELPERS •

smashing aperitif—and, equally, is a gentle way to take the edge off that hot-weather hangover.. 
It’s also a great accompaniment to a light, summery lunch like a salad of baby spinach, fresh 
mango, grilled chicken, sweet potato crisps, and cashew nuts. Don’t wait for warm weather to 
treat yourself to a Fleming Jenkins, though: All you need on hand is a good bottle of Indian 
whisky. The rest is easy.
Fill a cocktail shaker three-quarters full with ice. Add the 
absinthe and the Indian whisky. Shake well for about 20 
seconds, and strain over one cube of hand-cut ice into a rocks 
glass. Add a splash of club soda and three drops of curried bitters, 
and serve immediately. Then start preparing round two!The rise of Indian whiskey. Since the 1980s, India, like Japan, has 
been giving Scotland a run for its money when it comes to the whisky making 
game. And that’s a bit of a surprise. Why? First of all, India is part of an equa-
torial climate zone, and its off-the-chart temperatures can be overwhelming 
to both humans and the production of distilled spirits. After all, whisky’s 
ancestral homes are Scotland and Ireland, where early producers distilled 
their liquor in climates far cooler than India’s—and for longer periods of time. 
In India (except, perhaps, in the far northern Himalayan Mountains where 
logistics make it impossible to distill whisky anyway), the temperature is hot 
for most of the year. That, coupled with the high humidity, makes the aging of 
whisky a far faster process than it would be in Europe. 
However, the final results are incredibly delicious. Indian distillers are begin-
ning to experiment with whiskies bottled at cask strength—a potent reminder 
that great whisky certainly doesn’t have to come from Scotland. A word of 
warning, though: Most Indian whisky isn’t actually made from grain. Instead, 
it’s often distilled from sugar cane or molasses, and is more of a flavored 
whisky substitute. The label on its bottle may hint at a fine Scottish heritage, 
but don’t be fooled: Be sure you’re buying grain-based Indian whisky when you 
invest in some. (Rum-based “whisky” of the lesser sort possesses all the stuff-ing to give you one of the most memorable hangovers of your life. Keep a large 
bottle of Fernet Branca handy for any such experiments into foolhardiness.)  SIDENOTEHANGOVER HELPERS •

_ GRAPEFRUIT ZEST TWIST  One of my favorite restorative cocktails, this easy-to-make tipple features Sambuca, which can act 
as a powerful “wake-me-up” for a stressed-out stomach. The freshly squeezed grapefruit juice adds 
a much-needed dose of vitamin C, while the citrusy, singed orange peel and the licorice-flavored 
Sambuca—not to mention the bitters—combine to reanimate the spirits of even the most zealous 
drinker. Do try my Sambuca Twist even if you’re not usually a fan of the liqueur’s distinctive 
aniseed scent and taste: Y ou’ll be amazed at how healing and refreshing it is after you’ve spent a 
long night propping up the bar.

Shake vigorously for fifteen seconds. Add a handful of ice cubes to 
a Collins glass, and strain the mixture over the ice. Singe a slice 
of fresh orange peel, pinching it firmly just behind the match to 
release its natural citrus oils, and then add it to the glass. Finally, 
shake the bitters into the drink, and garnish with the grapefruit

(Text)ASKEW BLOODY MARY
A twentieth-century classic, the Bloody Mary is everyone’s favorite hangover cure. Originally created 
as a bracing, hair-raising combination of vodka, tomato juice, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, salt, 
and pepper, it’s got the power to revive even the most debauched drinker after a serious session. 
My Askew Bloody Mary is just as powerful as its predecessor, but it’s far more nuanced: lightly 
spiced, astringent, and terribly healing. It also involves a make-in-the-shaker shrub: Combine a 
tomato-celery puree with a little white wine vinegar and agave syrup, add to the other ingredients in 
your cocktail shaker, and bang!—all the flavor of an aged shrub, whipped up in seconds. What’s more, 
my Bloody calls for tequila instead of vodka, as well as a few drops of my Sherry Pepper Infusion 
for a little palate-cleansing heat. Serve with a protein-rich breakfast, like an omelet stuffed with feta, 
spinach, and bacon.   _ 4 OUNCES (120 ML) QUICK ROASTED

of cognac, gin, apple brandy, vermouth, and falernum soothes the pain of the night before and 
rejuvenates all five aching senses at once.

Fill a Boston shaker three-quarters full with ice. Gently pour the 
cognac, calvados, gin, vermouth, and falernum over the ice, and 
shake briskly for thirty seconds. Toss a few ice cubes into a short 
rocks glass. Strain the mixture into the glass, sit back, and slowly 
sip that hangover away. 
Falernum fables. Made in the West Indies, falernum is a liqueur that 
sports a heady mixture of Caribbean flavors such as almond, ginger, cloves, 
vanilla, and lime—a fragrant combination that, if you ask me, takes the 
sting out of even the most heinous of hangovers. Its origins are obscure, but 
it was probably first made in Barbados sometime in the nineteenth century. 
These days, “falernum” is a nonalcoholic syrup, but it takes its name from 
an different source—an ancient Roman wine called falernian, which was 
made from late-harvested grapes, and which, according to legend, was so 
high in alcohol it could be set on fire. (Modern falernum isn’t flammable, so 
don’t try this at home!) You can make a homemade version of it, if you like, 
but it’s also widely available in liquor stores. Use it in your Corpse Revivier, 
and in tiki-style drinks of all sorts. SIDENOTE

stomachs, it combines fragrant orange flower water with gin, frothed egg white, half-and-half, 
sugar, milk, lemon juice, and lots of fizzy soda water. Then it’s shaken for several minutes in 
order to “cook” the egg whites and make for a softly fizzy cocktail that is a powerful emulsifier

headaches and calm jazzy nerves). The creamy quality of the egg whites and the half-and-half 
soothe the belly in ways totally unappreciated until a hangover actually hits. If you’re really feeling rough, get someone else to shake the cocktail for you; remember, no sudden movements.

Fill a Boston shaker three-quarters full of ice. One at a time, add 
all the ingredients to it, and mix well. Shake well for at least two 
minutes. (Legend has it that real connoisseurs shake their Ramos

(Text)THE AIL AND CURE SWIZZLE
The Ail & Cure, a cousin of Doctor Livesey’s Cocktail, was created by cocktail connoisseur 
Christopher James, head bartender at the four-star Ryland Inn in Whitehouse, New Jersey. Chris 
says, “I can envision this cocktail being sipped during a beautiful day, on an island, by someone 
who might have a bit of a bellyache. Ginger beer was used medicinally in the Caribbean in the 
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, since ginger was especially good for relieving stomach pain. 
Angostura bitters were developed by a German army doctor, Dr. Ben Siegert, in Venezuela in 
order to aid his troops in the digestion of their food. And we all know Caribbean rum can very 
well cure all the imagined ills that ail you! With the first sip of this drink, as you inhale the 
soothing scent of the aromatic mint garnish, I'm sure you will be transported to this special place 
I've imagined—and I'm positive your bellyache or bad mood will subside.”

legend has it, José Gaspar went rogue and attacked the city of Tampa. He came to no good end. 
This fruity, liquor-laden libation, the José Gaspar Cocktail, is an unlikely combination of two 
rogue spirits: Irish whiskey and rum, and this combination of the two best-known sea-going 
liquors has been known to transform the living into the living dead—and vice versa. If you fall 
into the latter category after last night’s antics,  now’s the time to mix up a batch of Gaspars and 
lift a glass to old José. (Oh, and do consider making your own grenadine: It’s so easy, and the 
store-bought stuff hasn’t got a patch on it.)

(Text)THE AIL AND CURE SWIZZLE
The Ail & Cure, a cousin of Doctor Livesey’s Cocktail, was created by cocktail connoisseur 
Christopher James, head bartender at the four-star Ryland Inn in Whitehouse, New Jersey. Chris 
says, “I can envision this cocktail being sipped during a beautiful day, on an island, by someone 
who might have a bit of a bellyache. Ginger beer was used medicinally in the Caribbean in the 
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, since ginger was especially good for relieving stomach pain. 
Angostura bitters were developed by a German army doctor, Dr. Ben Siegert, in Venezuela in 
order to aid his troops in the digestion of their food. And we all know Caribbean rum can very 
well cure all the imagined ills that ail you! With the first sip of this drink, as you inhale the 
soothing scent of the aromatic mint garnish, I'm sure you will be transported to this special place 
I've imagined—and I'm positive your bellyache or bad mood will subside.”

into a parfait glass half-filled with crushed ice. To finish, drip the 
curried bitters over the top of each drink. Serves two heavy heads.JOSÉ GASPAR COCKTAILHANGOVER HELPERS •

(Text)THAI BASIL FIZZ
Just like snowflakes, no two hangovers are alike. Did you get yours by indulging in spicy food, 
washed down by one (or four) too many cocktails? If that rings a bell, try a Thai Basil Fizz. Each 
of its ingredients are curatives, right down to the absinthe wash and lemon zest twist, and it’s 
constructed to be heavenly balm to both belly and head.  
_ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) BOTANICAL GIN
_ 1/4 OUNCE (7 ML) ABSINTHE_ 1 SPRIG HOLY BASIL (OR REGULAR  
BASIL), FINELY CHOPPED
_ 3 TO 4 SHAKES OF PEYCHAUD’S BITTERS  _ 2 TO 3 OUNCES (60 TO 90 M L ) 
 GINGER BEER
_ LEMON ZEST TWISTINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Toss the chopped basil into a Boston shaker. (Be sure to lean over 
the shaker for a restorative whiff of its crisp, spicy scent!) Add 
the gin and absinthe, and fill the shaker three-quarters full 
of ice. Sprinkle the bitters into the mix, then shake for twenty 
seconds, strain into a coupé glass, and top with the ginger beer. 
Garnish with the lemon zest twist. The heady combination of 
basil, ginger, and lemon is sure to brush the cobwebs away. 
Basil isn’t just for pesto anymore. With its bracing, peppery taste, the “royal 
herb,” as the ancient Greeks called it, has often been used in curatives in a 
number of ways. It was said to mitigate the symptoms of malaria; was made 
into a liniment to soothe sunburns, and a nerve tonic against stress and anx -
iety; and it is even said to promote longevity. One variety of the herb, called 
holy basil or Thai basil, is used as an ingredient alongside other green herbs 
in both absinthe and green chartreuse, due to its antiseptic and antibacterial 
qualities. (In fact, the striking green color of absinthe and chartreuse may 
pay homage to basil’s brilliant green hue.) And if you’re feeling poorly thanks 
to a night on the tiles, you’ll be delighted to learn that Thai basil can be very 
effective when it comes to healing a sour stomach. You’re welcome. SIDENOTE

(Text)ROAMING HOUND DOG COCKTAILSCRIVENER’S CAMP
Featuring a final flourish of luscious, dark chocolate bitters, this bracing cocktail is named for the 
men (and they usually were men) who, unlike many of their peers, could read and write. These 
gentlemen could be hired to perform secretarial duties for the population at large—most of whom 
were illiterate. Beware: After a couple rounds of Scrivener’s Camps, you may well need a scrivener 
to sign your name in your stead. That’s because three types of liquor work their potent magic in 
this cocktail: bourbon, absinthe, and, not least, vermouth, which was originally used as a hair tonic 
and scalp invigorator because of the exotic herbs, flower essences, and spices contained in each 
bottle. (My thoughts? Avoid this. Stick to applying vermouth to your mouth only.) But then again, 
if you were celebrating a little too avidly last night, that may be just what you need.
White whiskey—also known as “white dog”—is a versatile spirit indeed, and it’s especially delicious 
when paired with that toothsome Asian concoction known as bubble tea. Traditionally meant 
to accompany Vietnamese cuisine, bubble tea is a blend of coconut milk, ice, tapioca pearls, 
and sweet fruit or tea, and it’s wonderfully refreshing. While you can buy it at most Asian 
supermarkets, it’s easy to make at home. My version calls for pureed tropical fruits, like starfruit, 
Asian pears, jackfruits, and oranges, plus a dose of white whiskey and a little good-quality dark 
rum. If you can, use rhum agricole: Its intense sugar-cane flavor is delicious against the icy 
creaminess of coconut milk and coconut cream. The Roaming Hound Dog has the bite to match 
its bark, which means it’s just the ticket if you’re looking for a little hair of the dog.  _ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) BOURBON,

Fill a cocktail mixing glass half full with ice. Add the bourbon, the

to combine. Then pour the absinthe into a coupe glass: You can 
either drink it immediately and leave its residue in the glass as a 
glass wash, or you can leave the full portion of absinthe in the glass 
(I prefer the latter). Strain the bourbon mixture over the absinthe 
into the coupe glass; dot the top of the cocktail with the chocolate 
bitters, and garnish with an Easy Home-Cured Cocktail Cherry.

Fill a cocktail mixing glass half full with ice. Add the bourbon, the 
Carpano Antica, and the grapefruit juice, and stir about 20 times 
to combine. Then pour the absinthe into a coupe glass: You can 
either drink it immediately and leave its residue in the glass as a 
glass wash, or you can leave the full portion of absinthe in the glass 
(I prefer the latter). Strain the bourbon mixture over the absinthe 
into the coupe glass; dot the top of the cocktail with the chocolate 
bitters, and garnish with an Easy Home-Cured Cocktail Cherry.

(Text)SCRIVENER’S CAMP
Featuring a final flourish of luscious, dark chocolate bitters, this bracing cocktail is named for the 
men (and they usually were men) who, unlike many of their peers, could read and write. These 
gentlemen could be hired to perform secretarial duties for the population at large—most of whom 
were illiterate. Beware: After a couple rounds of Scrivener’s Camps, you may well need a scrivener 
to sign your name in your stead. That’s because three types of liquor work their potent magic in 
this cocktail: bourbon, absinthe, and, not least, vermouth, which was originally used as a hair tonic 
and scalp invigorator because of the exotic herbs, flower essences, and spices contained in each 
bottle. (My thoughts? Avoid this. Stick to applying vermouth to your mouth only.) But then again, 
if you were celebrating a little too avidly last night, that may be just what you need.
White whiskey—also known as “white dog”—is a versatile spirit indeed, and it’s especially delicious 
when paired with that toothsome Asian concoction known as bubble tea. Traditionally meant 
to accompany Vietnamese cuisine, bubble tea is a blend of coconut milk, ice, tapioca pearls, 
and sweet fruit or tea, and it’s wonderfully refreshing. While you can buy it at most Asian 
supermarkets, it’s easy to make at home. My version calls for pureed tropical fruits, like starfruit, 
Asian pears, jackfruits, and oranges, plus a dose of white whiskey and a little good-quality dark 
rum. If you can, use rhum agricole: Its intense sugar-cane flavor is delicious against the icy 
creaminess of coconut milk and coconut cream. The Roaming Hound Dog has the bite to match 
its bark, which means it’s just the ticket if you’re looking for a little hair of the dog.  _ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) WHITE WHISKEY

Pour the white whiskey and dark rum into a blender. Then add 
the fruit puree, coconut milk, and coconut cream, along with 
a few handfuls of crushed ice and the jasmine tea. Blend until 
smooth. Toss the tapioca pearls into a tall glass, and pour a large 
measure of the Roaming Hound Dog mixture over them. Use a 
colorful, wide-mouthed straw to suck up each succulent pearl.   HANGOVER HELPERS •

out in a sweat with their fiery heat, but after eating them, you feel cleansed 
and purified, in both body and soul. And the same went for your ancestors.

peppers with magnesium. When these ingredients were combined with grain 
alcohol and used either as an external salve or an internal elixir, they’d have 
offered sufferers relief from a whole score of painful ailments, such as lower 
back pain, muscle cramps, and fibromyalgia. And chiles are also rich in vita-

(Text)CLEVER LEMONADE FIZZ  WRINGING OUT HIS FISHERMAN’S CAP
I’m a huge fan of Vietnamese salty lemonade, an ultra-refreshing drink that uses chanh mu ối, or 
lemons preserved in salt, as its base. It’s not as weird as it sounds. An Asian home remedy that’s as 
old as the hills, chanh mu ối has been credited with curing everything from head colds to nausea—and 
it’s a surprisingly versatile and delicious creature. (Don’t worry about preserving lemons yourself: 
They’re easily found in most Asian supermarkets.) This simple cocktail spikes Vietnamese lem-
onade with Tennessee sipping whiskey, and the result is more than clever—it’s enchanting. The 
whiskey’s tangy, smoky aroma is illuminated by deep citrus flavors enrobed in salt spray, and it’s 
just the ticket when you’re craving something salty, citrusy, thirst-quenching, and belly-friendly 
all at once. Not every hangover calls for the hair of the dog. Soothe yours with this cool mocktail instead, 
which features what’s probably the best lemonade you’ll ever try. It takes a little extra time to 
prepare, but it’s so worth it: Before juicing, you submerge your lemons in a bath of spring water, 
raw honey, and sea salt—and then you grill them over wood charcoal for a new, unexpected flavor. 
Lemon and mint, of course, are a time-honored duo, and they taste even better when you slap your 
mint before using it as a garnish. (Never slapped your herbs before? Start now. Simply wash a piece 
of spearmint well, then place it into the palm of one hand and slap your other hand against it. This 
releases the mint’s oils and makes it cocktail-glass-ready without bruising the leaves too much.) 
Named for the salt-drenched headgear of hardy fishermen, this invigorating drink is especially 
lovely before or after lunch.

prepare, but it’s so worth it: Before juicing, you submerge your lemons in a bath of spring water, 
raw honey, and sea salt—and then you grill them over wood charcoal for a new, unexpected flavor. 
Lemon and mint, of course, are a time-honored duo, and they taste even better when you slap your 
mint before using it as a garnish. (Never slapped your herbs before? Start now. Simply wash a piece 
of spearmint well, then place it into the palm of one hand and slap your other hand against it. This 
releases the mint’s oils and makes it cocktail-glass-ready without bruising the leaves too much.) 
Named for the salt-drenched headgear of hardy fishermen, this invigorating drink is especially 
lovely before or after lunch.

(Text)CLEVER LEMONADE FIZZ  WRINGING OUT HIS FISHERMAN’S CAP
I’m a huge fan of Vietnamese salty lemonade, an ultra-refreshing drink that uses chanh mu ối, or 
lemons preserved in salt, as its base. It’s not as weird as it sounds. An Asian home remedy that’s as 
old as the hills, chanh mu ối has been credited with curing everything from head colds to nausea—and 
it’s a surprisingly versatile and delicious creature. (Don’t worry about preserving lemons yourself: 
They’re easily found in most Asian supermarkets.) This simple cocktail spikes Vietnamese lem-
onade with Tennessee sipping whiskey, and the result is more than clever—it’s enchanting. The 
whiskey’s tangy, smoky aroma is illuminated by deep citrus flavors enrobed in salt spray, and it’s 
just the ticket when you’re craving something salty, citrusy, thirst-quenching, and belly-friendly 
all at once. Not every hangover calls for the hair of the dog. Soothe yours with this cool mocktail instead,

(Text)MILK THISTLE SPRITZ BRANCA MENTA AND COLA 
Since time immemorial, potent herbal digestifs such as Branca Menta have been mixed with cool 
water, ice, and sugar to relieve tired, overheated bodies and to calm and cheer testy moods. Like its 
Italian cousin Fernet Branca, it’s an aromatic, herbal liqueur that contains over forty (top-secret!) 
herbs, plus an extra dose of menthol and peppermint, both of which cool down the body and 
mellow out the mind. It also contains anise, which as any apothecary worth his salt would tell you, 
adds a crisp licorice flavor to the mix, and encourages relaxation. (And after all that wine you had 
last night, relaxation is just what you need.) This simple, bracing cocktail rounds out the Menta 
with a hit of cola, which takes the bitter edge off the liqueur’s remedial botanicals. 
Set firmly in the early ages of the apothecary, this healing spritz derives its benefits from the 
curative herb milk thistle, and the herbs inherent in the bracing taste of the Italian digestif 
aperol. Since milk thistle is said to promote liver health, there’s nothing better than this fizzy, 
rejuvenating tipple for cleansing the body and lightening the mind.   _ 3 OUNCES (90 ML) BRANCA MENTA

tonic for hundreds of years, milk thistle promotes digestive health and helps 
the liver eliminate toxins. (It may be helpful for kidney and gallbladder health, too.) Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine prescribe it to help reduce 
inflammation and facilitate the growth of new cells: In fact, it may both prevent 
and repair liver damage, which is, of course, great for whole-body health. After all, when the liver is doing its job well, the entire body feels better. Just another 
reason to mix up a Milk Thistle Spritz next time a hangover rears its ugly head. SIDENOTEHANGOVER HELPERS •

(Text)BRANCA MENTA AND COLA 
Since time immemorial, potent herbal digestifs such as Branca Menta have been mixed with cool 
water, ice, and sugar to relieve tired, overheated bodies and to calm and cheer testy moods. Like its 
Italian cousin Fernet Branca, it’s an aromatic, herbal liqueur that contains over forty (top-secret!) 
herbs, plus an extra dose of menthol and peppermint, both of which cool down the body and 
mellow out the mind. It also contains anise, which as any apothecary worth his salt would tell you, 
adds a crisp licorice flavor to the mix, and encourages relaxation. (And after all that wine you had 
last night, relaxation is just what you need.) This simple, bracing cocktail rounds out the Menta 
with a hit of cola, which takes the bitter edge off the liqueur’s remedial botanicals. 
Set firmly in the early ages of the apothecary, this healing spritz derives its benefits from the 
curative herb milk thistle, and the herbs inherent in the bracing taste of the Italian digestif 
aperol. Since milk thistle is said to promote liver health, there’s nothing better than this fizzy, 
rejuvenating tipple for cleansing the body and lightening the mind.   Pack a tall glass with ice cubes. Pour the Branca Menta over 
the ice—you’ll feel revitalized after just a whiff of its bracing 
scent. Add the cola slowly, and sip your way to relief. 
Combine all the ingredients except the seltzer water and bitters over 
a few handfuls of ice in a Boston shaker. Shake for a few seconds until 
well combined. Divide the mixture between two Collins glasses; then 
top each with the seltzer water, and add two dashes of bitters per glass. 
Serve, imbibe, and prepare to feel refreshed and renewed. Serves 2.  Thwart that hangover with milk thistle. Renowned as a liver 
tonic for hundreds of years, milk thistle promotes digestive health and helps 
the liver eliminate toxins. (It may be helpful for kidney and gallbladder health, too.) Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine prescribe it to help reduce 
inflammation and facilitate the growth of new cells: In fact, it may both prevent 
and repair liver damage, which is, of course, great for whole-body health. After all, when the liver is doing its job well, the entire body feels better. Just another 
reason to mix up a Milk Thistle Spritz next time a hangover rears its ugly head. SIDENOTEHANGOVER HELPERS •

_ ICEThis long drink will add a touch of class to just about any casual meal. It’s simple: Just ditch the 
boring corn syrup-based sodas in favor of this kicked-up cousin of the rum ‘n’ cola. The Captain 
Swank is definitely on the sweet side—which is no bad thing if you like a little sugar the morning

Place one long spear of hand-cut ice, or 2 ice cubes, in a Collins glass. 
Pour the white whiskey over the ice, and then add the sarsaparilla soda

(Text)A SENSIBLE THING
With its notes of salt and smoke, Japanese whisky is reminiscent of its namesake, Scotch whisky. 
And, like Scotch, it can be used with impunity in all sorts of hot toddies. A Sensible Thing, 
with its whisky and freshly squeezed lemon juice for snap and acidity, is a bit of an oxymoron: a 
chilled toddy. Like a hot toddy, though, it’s still a wonderful way to revive body and soul—and 
besides, some say cooling drinks are more soothing if you’re nursing a bit of a banger. I like to 
twist my toddy up a bit by adding yuzu syrup (yuzu is a Japanese citrus fruit), and a final float 
of plum wine. I finish it off with a bit of fizzy water for lift, and I always serve it over a hand-
cut-and-polished ice round. A Sensible Thing is fabulously refreshing, but observe the name and 
sip ’em sensibly—more than a couple, and you might find your faculties seriously compromised.

Using a muddler or the end of a wooden spoon, muddle the

three-quarters full with ice. Add the whisky, and mix carefully 
with a bar spoon. Using a Hawthorne strainer, strain the mixture 
over a single hand-cut ice cube into a coupé glass. Float the plum 
wine over the top of the drink, and sip—sensibly, of course.

sound like a terribly traditional Japanese drink, but whisky (no “e” again, in 
this case) is hugely popular in Japan. Today, the country’s whisky distillers 
are practically beating the Scots at their own game—the game of distillation, 
that is. The Japanese are crafting super-premium, luxury whiskys that are 
being enjoyed all over the world. As with Scotch whisky, every sip of Japanese 
whisky features that unmistakable scent of peat smoke, then widens into 
the sweetness and long finish provided by the slowly-cooked grains that 
lend liquid sophistication to the sup and simply shimmer across the palate. 
Enjoying Japanese whisky can be every bit as elegant and pricy—if not more 
so—as some Scottish single-malt whiskys. Plus, it doesn’t have to be drunk 
neat: It’s just marvelous with a splash of seltzer water and a teaspoon of one 
of Japan’s other great exports, sake, swirled with green tea. It’s also highly 
expressive in a head-cold-busting hot toddy that combines freshly squeezed 
yuzu juice, hot cider, and raw honey. And that’s just the beginning. Invest in 
a bottle of Japanese whisky stat, and experiment by using it in your craft 
cocktails in place of Scotch. SIDENOTEHANGOVER HELPERS •

(Text)YOU’VE BEEN LYING IN BED WATCHING THE CLOCK FOR—WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE FOREVER.  
MINUTES CREEP INTO HOURS: IF ONLY YOU COULD TURN OFF YOUR BRAIN AS EASILY AS  
YOU TURN OFF THE TELEVISION. SINCE YOU CAN’T, YOUR MIND IS AT ITS OWN MERCY,  
AND THOUGHTS RATTLE AND CREAK THROUGH YOUR HEAD LIKE RUSTY WHEELS. YOU LOOK  
AT THE CLOCK AGAIN, AND DO THE MATH: IF I FALL ASLEEP RIGHT NOW, I’LL STILL GET  
FIVE—NO, FOUR, HOURS IN BEFORE I HAVE TO GET UP . BUT THE SANDMAN IS NOWHERE IN  
SIGHT. YOU’RE STILL WIDE AWAKE. WHAT’S A BODY TO DO?We’ve all been there. Sleeplessness seems to strike just when you most need the rest. 
Terribly unfair, isn’t it? But taking some downtime before bed can help ease you into 
the serene mood that’ll help you fall asleep, and stay asleep till morning. And you 
can rest assured (no pun intended!) that old-time pharmacists and apothecaries would have been 
plagued by customers complaining of the very same problem. Luckily, they’d have had a few pow-
erful remedies in their alleviative arsenal. For instance, teas made from valerian root or chamomile 
could (and can still) relieve anxiety and irritation, and could help the patient fall into a restorative 
sleep that would ease peevishness and help heal illnesses. And the natural oils in herbs like sage 
and rosemary can promote a sense of calm and content, which might have taken the nervous edge 
off the stressed, the sick, and the restless. They probably used other botanicals, too, like St. John’s 
wort, which is still used today in supplement form to balance negative moods, thereby promoting 
healthy sleep patterns.
 And, of course, alcohol was recommended as an antidote to insomnia (and besides, it was 
essential in preserving the healing plant material in apothecary preparations). Today, we know that 
too much alcohol, especially right before bed, can actually harm restful sleep, but a well-chosen 
nightcap (one, now, not six) can still be part of the process of relaxing before turning in for the night. And that’s where the craft cocktails in this chapter really shine. Traditionally, warm drinks, 
like toddies, hot milk, or spiked tea, are recommended when it comes to welcoming sleep, and there 
are some delicious, easy-to-make examples in the pages that follow. Try, for instance, the Sailor’s 
Friend: it’s nothing more than a well-crafted combination of hot tea, rum, and a little honey and 
lemon, but I challenge you to find a better before-bed beverage. Then there’s the Mexican Sleep 
Cure, which is luxuriously rich hot chocolate that’s been warmed with a little cayenne pepper and 
a dose of smoky mezcal: it’s dessert and a nightcap all in one. 
 But what do you do if the weather’s warm and sticky, and hot drinks are the last thing you’re 
craving? The good news is that there are plenty of cool, soothing cocktails than can have a soporific effect. My Les Heretiers Curative is a prime example: it’s a combination of rum, coconut water, 
sugar syrup, and aromatic bitters suspended in fizzy water, which is just what you want if the 
temperature’s soared and sleep is elusive. And my Herbal Sleep Punch combines herbal infusions 
with a little botanical gin for an evening sedative that’s as tasty as is relaxing. Or, if you want a more 
traditional (read: short, whiskey-based) nightcap, make yourself a Thomas Riley Marshall Cocktail: 
it’s nothing more than Scotch, peach brandy, and curried bitters over ice. Then simply sip it slowly

(Text)YOU’VE BEEN LYING IN BED WATCHING THE CLOCK FOR—WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE FOREVER.  
MINUTES CREEP INTO HOURS: IF ONLY YOU COULD TURN OFF YOUR BRAIN AS EASILY AS  
YOU TURN OFF THE TELEVISION. SINCE YOU CAN’T, YOUR MIND IS AT ITS OWN MERCY,  
AND THOUGHTS RATTLE AND CREAK THROUGH YOUR HEAD LIKE RUSTY WHEELS. YOU LOOK  AT THE CLOCK AGAIN, AND DO THE MATH: IF I FALL ASLEEP RIGHT NOW, I’LL STILL GET  
FIVE—NO, FOUR, HOURS IN BEFORE I HAVE TO GET UP . BUT THE SANDMAN IS NOWHERE IN  
SIGHT. YOU’RE STILL WIDE AWAKE. WHAT’S A BODY TO DO?We’ve all been there. Sleeplessness seems to strike just when you most need the rest. 
Terribly unfair, isn’t it? But taking some downtime before bed can help ease you into 
the serene mood that’ll help you fall asleep, and stay asleep till morning. And you 
can rest assured (no pun intended!) that old-time pharmacists and apothecaries would have been 
plagued by customers complaining of the very same problem. Luckily, they’d have had a few pow-
erful remedies in their alleviative arsenal. For instance, teas made from valerian root or chamomile 
could (and can still) relieve anxiety and irritation, and could help the patient fall into a restorative 
sleep that would ease peevishness and help heal illnesses. And the natural oils in herbs like sage 
and rosemary can promote a sense of calm and content, which might have taken the nervous edge 
off the stressed, the sick, and the restless. They probably used other botanicals, too, like St. John’s 
wort, which is still used today in supplement form to balance negative moods, thereby promoting 
healthy sleep patterns.
 And, of course, alcohol was recommended as an antidote to insomnia (and besides, it was 
essential in preserving the healing plant material in apothecary preparations). Today, we know that 
too much alcohol, especially right before bed, can actually harm restful sleep, but a well-chosen 
nightcap (one, now, not six) can still be part of the process of relaxing before turning in for the 
night. And that’s where the craft cocktails in this chapter really shine. Traditionally, warm drinks, 
like toddies, hot milk, or spiked tea, are recommended when it comes to welcoming sleep, and there 
are some delicious, easy-to-make examples in the pages that follow. Try, for instance, the Sailor’s 
Friend: it’s nothing more than a well-crafted combination of hot tea, rum, and a little honey and 
lemon, but I challenge you to find a better before-bed beverage. Then there’s the Mexican Sleep 
Cure, which is luxuriously rich hot chocolate that’s been warmed with a little cayenne pepper and 
a dose of smoky mezcal: it’s dessert and a nightcap all in one. 
 But what do you do if the weather’s warm and sticky, and hot drinks are the last thing you’re 
craving? The good news is that there are plenty of cool, soothing cocktails than can have a soporific 
effect. My Les Heretiers Curative is a prime example: it’s a combination of rum, coconut water, 
sugar syrup, and aromatic bitters suspended in fizzy water, which is just what you want if the 
temperature’s soared and sleep is elusive. And my Herbal Sleep Punch combines herbal infusions 
with a little botanical gin for an evening sedative that’s as tasty as is relaxing. Or, if you want a more 
traditional (read: short, whiskey-based) nightcap, make yourself a Thomas Riley Marshall Cocktail: 
it’s nothing more than Scotch, peach brandy, and curried bitters over ice. Then simply sip it slowly 
and meditatively, and let sleep steal over you.  
 There’s plenty more where those came from. The handmade cocktails in this chapter are sure to

This toddy is built with simple, honest materials that haven’t changed much over the years: 
hot water, a large dose of spiced rum, and lemon—a trinity that can’t help but hasten the old 
closed-eye relaxation. And we have the seamen of yore to thank for its popularity: Sailors whose 
watch was scheduled for the middle of the night would have to force themselves to sleep during 
the day, whether they liked it or not. This historically accurate toddy would have been a sailor’s 
best friend when cold, misty weather made it difficult to get some shut-eye. Plus, honey has been 
used as an expectorant since Roman times. Today, it’s still a powerful ally against scratchy sore 
throats and those pesky, chesty coughs that can keep you tossing and turning at night. Enjoy one 
an hour before bedtime. 
_ BOILING WATER
_ 3 OUNCES (90 ML) DARK SPICED RUM
_ HONEY, TO TASTE
_ LEMON WHEELINGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Preheat a mug by filling it with boiling water; discard the water 
after a few seconds. Add the rum to the mug and top with boiling 
water. Stir in honey to taste, and sip until sleep approaches off the 
ship’s starboard side. Oh, and don’t forget to float the lemon wheel 
on top of the toddy to stave off your chances of contracting scurvy.

on top of the toddy to stave off your chances of contracting scurvy. A rum deal? The Sailor’s Friend calls for dark spiced rum, since it’s 
especially lovely in a toddy. But wait a minute: What’s the difference between 
light rum and dark rum? The answer is more complex than you’d think. It 
might sound counterintuitive, but light rum isn’t necessarily young, and dark 
rum isn’t necessarily old. 
Here’s why. All rum is made from fermented sugar cane extract, and most is 
distilled from fermented sugarcane molasses (except Rhum Agricole, which 
is made from sugar cane juice, not molasses). Light rum is aged in stain-
less-steel or uncharred oak barrels, which means it’s pretty much colorless. 
Medium-bodied or “golden” rums are darker and more deeply-flavored, but 
don’t be fooled: Unfortunately, most golden and dark rums have artificial 
flavoring and coloring added to them in order to trick the buyer into thinking 
they’ve been resting in oak barrels for years. (The truth is that rum, like 
whiskey, can actually get lighter in color over time. Some of the finest rum 
I’ve ever enjoyed was twenty-three years old and light in color—not stained 
the color of Admiral Nelson’s blood!) Because of this, color is by no means an 
indication of age or quality. (Regardless of color, rums that have been aged 
for longer earn the designation anejo, which means “old” in Spanish.) 
That said, there are rums on the market that do not use caramel coloring 
or artificial flavouring. So do your research before you buy. Visit distillers’ 
websites (or the actual premises, if you can!) and don’t be afraid to contact 
them with any questions. Alternatively, you can ask an expert at your local 
wine and spirits store for guidance. Respect your craft cocktails by using the 
best-quality rum you can afford!SIDENOTENOTABLE NIGHTCAPS •

ML) OF WHOLE MILK WITH A 1/4 CUP  
(60 ML) OF HEAVY CREAM. ADD 1/4  
POUND (115 G) GRATED BITTERSWEET  
CHOCOLATE. HEAT SLOWLY, DO NOT BOIL,

_ 1/2 TEASPOON VANILLA EXTRACT
_ DARK BROWN SUGAR, TO TASTEHot, bittersweet, chile-laden concoctions hailing from Mexico are said to enhance repose and 
restfulness. Here, mezcal tops up a cup of spicy Mexican hot chocolate; it’s not only delicious, it’s 
also very effective when it comes to chasing the sandman. Skip the sleeping pills, and indulge in 
a cupful this evening.
INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Prepare the hot chocolate. Preheat a mug by pouring boiling water 
into it; discard the water after a few seconds. Add the mezcal to 
the mug, followed by the hot chocolate, and then doctor it with 
the vanilla extract and sugar. Sip, and sleep is sure to follow. MEXICAN SLEEP CURE
Meet mezcal. Let me introduce you to the Mexican spirit mescal, which 
sure is a potent beast. It’s made from the agave plant, which grows in many 
parts of Mexico, and is said to be sacred in Mexican culture; it’s certainly 
played a large part in the country’s history and mythology since well before 
the Spanish conquest in the sixteenth century. Mezcal is a pale-yellow color, 
sports a distinctively smoky aroma, and is usually served neat. These days it 
graces the shelves of cocktail bars around the world, but apothecaries of old 
might have suggested a slug of this aguardiente, or firewater, to those whose 
love lives were drooping, since it’s reputed to lift the libido—and the spirits. SIDENOTE

a cupful this evening.
Prepare the hot chocolate. Preheat a mug by pouring boiling water 
into it; discard the water after a few seconds. Add the mezcal to 
the mug, followed by the hot chocolate, and then doctor it with 
the vanilla extract and sugar. Sip, and sleep is sure to follow. 
Meet mezcal. Let me introduce you to the Mexican spirit mescal, which 
sure is a potent beast. It’s made from the agave plant, which grows in many 
parts of Mexico, and is said to be sacred in Mexican culture; it’s certainly 
played a large part in the country’s history and mythology since well before 
the Spanish conquest in the sixteenth century. Mezcal is a pale-yellow color, 
sports a distinctively smoky aroma, and is usually served neat. These days it 
graces the shelves of cocktail bars around the world, but apothecaries of old 
might have suggested a slug of this aguardiente, or firewater, to those whose 
love lives were drooping, since it’s reputed to lift the libido—and the spirits.

_ 6 OUNCES (175 ML) BOILING WATER
_ 1 OUNCE (25 ML) RAW HONEY SIMPLE  
SYRUP (SEE PAGE 312-313)  We all know that restful sleep doesn’t come easy, especially when you really need it. So it’s no 
surprise that nearly every country in the world has developed its own remedies for wakefulness. 
In Germany, a teaspoon of distilled Alpine herbs suspended in a tonic made with wildflower 
honey and then added to a cup of hot water or tea is known to ease stress and to set tired eyelids 
fluttering. Made with dozens of herbs and spices— don’t bother asking which ones, since the 
recipes for these tonics are usually guarded like state secrets—it’s likely that these tonics were 
originally designed as cough remedies or digestives. Today, many of these liqueurs are widely 
available outside of Deutschland, so they should be relatively easy to find. This simple recipe is just 
the ticket when it comes to combating restlessness and inducing relaxation.
INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Preheat a mug by filling it with boiling water; discard the water after a 
few seconds. Add the Alpine herbal elixir to the mug, and top with more 
boiling water. Sweeten with the honey simple syrup and you’ll drift off 
to sleep dreaming of little goats frolicking on Alpine mountaintops. GERMAN RELAXATION

_ 3 TO 4 OUNCES (90 TO 120

_ 10 DROPS JAMAICAN BITTERSColds can strike year-round, and when they do, they can keep you up at night—all night. It’d take 
magical powers beyond even the Cocktail Whisperer’s understanding to actually cure a cold—but 
it’s certainly possible to relieve its symptoms. For starters, peppermint has analgesic qualities, 
which means it’s known to ease cold-related pain like headaches, and peppermint infusions can 
also relieve ailments of the stomach, such as nausea, indigestion, and seasickness. It’s also used 
in Bénédictine, one of the main ingredients in this insomnia-banishing drink. Be sure to crown 
your Cold Cure #1001 with Jamaican bitters, which are said to contain ingredients widely used in 
folk healing, such as allspice, ginger, and black pepper. Breathe deeply before taking a sip of this 
curative: If that stubborn cold makes breathing feel like snorkeling with a drinking straw, a few 
whiffs of these aromas will alleviate congestion and speed snoozing.
INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Prepare the pot of peppermint tea; then remove the teabags. Preheat 
two large mugs by filling them with boiling water; discard the water 
after a few seconds. Add the Bénédictine, followed by the vermouth, to

(Text)SCOTCHMAN’S SLUMBER LES HÉRITIERS CURATIVE 
Warm drinks made with Scotch whisky are tried-and-true ways for courting that elusive gnome 
named Sleep. That’s because Scotch is such a versatile healer: It’s said to be effective against 
tension, restlessness, and even sleepwalking. Back in the heyday of apothecaries, high levels of 
stress probably contributed to insomnia: If the pharmacist could treat the stress, his patient would 
be more likely to get some shut-eye. And some things never change: Unfortunately, anxiety can 
still make bedtime an ordeal, but it’ll ebb away after a few sips of this robust curative. Of course, 
Scotch is delicious—and remedial—when taken neat or on the rocks, but its unique, smoky flavor 
is also a great complement to savory beef broth. And this toddy is naturally caffeine-free, making 
it especially good at dimming the internal lights.Back in the day, apothecaries in the Caribbean knew just what to do if a patient complained of 
feeling heavyhearted, glum, or irritable. They’d prescribe a hearty dose of their favorite curative, 
Rhum Agricole. Made from cane sugar, this overproof rum would’ve acted as a preservative for 
delicate herbs and spices, and it might have given the patient something to look forward to at the 
end of an interminable (and possibly expensive) curative session. Rum takes pride of place in the 
Les Héritiers Cocktail, alongside healing bitters and fizzy water: a wonderfully simple combination 
that’s sure to help you unwind—especially in warm weather, when you need a soothing nightcap 
but can’t stand the thought of hot liquids. Les héretiers means “the princes” in French, and you’re 
sure to feel like one after a dose of this delicious prescriptive.

like. Strain the mixture into a coupé glass, and serve. Relax, 
sip, and repeat, and let that cranky mood drift away.

_ JUICE OF 1 LIME

_ 3 OUNCES (90 ML) BOTANICAL GINHot drinks aren’t the only answer when it comes to curatives that enhance restful sleep. In fact, 
I’m especially fond of cool liquids when sleep seems miles away. That’s where this recipe comes in: 
A punch made from herbal teas and botanical gin can relieve sleeplessness, even when it feels as if 
nothing could possibly bring you a single step closer to the land of Nod. This cocktail combines 
infusions of herbs known to relax the sleep-deprived, and traditional apothecaries would have 
been well versed in their benefits. Chamomile, an anti-inflammatory, has been used as an antidote 
to anxiety for centuries; lavender is said to gently ease irritating sleep disturbances; and fennel 
helps to keep digestion on track. A dose of botanical gin and lime juice bind the infusions together 
into a gentle tipple that will help turn off the lights for even the most dedicated insomniac. 
INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Infuse the teabags in hot water for at least an hour. When 
cool, pack a tall glass with ice. Pour the tea over the ice; add 
the lime juice, and sweeten to taste with the honey simple 
syrup. Finally, add the gin, and mix gently. Sleep tight!HERBAL SLEEP PUNCH

(Text)SAKE RACER CABIN IN THE PINES COCKTAIL
Here’s another cooling cocktail that’s great for relaxing both body and mind. If you need more 
than a little help winding down in the evenings, stage a retreat from the real world, and mix 
yourself a Cabin in the Pines. Here, stone fruits like peaches and plums become extra-luscious 
when slow-roasted in the oven:  They assume otherworldly shapes and colors, their sweet, sum-
mery flavors become concentrated and intensified, and viscous juices flow from deep within their 
shriveled flesh. (Roast and cool your fruit well before bedtime; you won’t want to wait that long 
for your Cabin.) When muddled and mixed with white whiskey, they become magical stuff. Add a 
bit of club soda and a splash of Fernet Branca for health—just in case overindulgence is the cause 
of your insomnia!—and you’ve got a chilled-out restorative of the highest order.  
Suffering from wakeful nights? Enjoying sake—that is, Japanese rice wine —may encourage 
sleep to come knocking. Sake has a higher alcohol content than table wine, typically around 18 
to 20 percent, but it’s said to be gentler on the stomach than other forms of alcohol—and that’s 
good to know if typical table wine doesn’t agree with you. Since it’s packed with amino acids, 
it’s even said to promote healthy skin when applied topically. (In creams and cosmetics, that is. 
Don’t wash your face with it.) In addition to the warm sake—which shouldn’t be heated over 
140 degrees, by the way—the Sake Racer includes an infusion of healing, soothing herbs, along 
with a bit of botanical gin and a final touch of rich plum wine for sweetness. Combined, these 
ingredients can offer asylum even from the most obstinate insomnia. Sayonara, sleeplessness!   _ 2 HEAPING TABLESPOONS (30 G)

(Text)CABIN IN THE PINES COCKTAIL
Here’s another cooling cocktail that’s great for relaxing both body and mind. If you need more 
than a little help winding down in the evenings, stage a retreat from the real world, and mix 
yourself a Cabin in the Pines. Here, stone fruits like peaches and plums become extra-luscious 
when slow-roasted in the oven:  They assume otherworldly shapes and colors, their sweet, sum -
mery flavors become concentrated and intensified, and viscous juices flow from deep within their 
shriveled flesh. (Roast and cool your fruit well before bedtime; you won’t want to wait that long 
for your Cabin.) When muddled and mixed with white whiskey, they become magical stuff. Add a 
bit of club soda and a splash of Fernet Branca for health—just in case overindulgence is the cause 
of your insomnia!—and you’ve got a chilled-out restorative of the highest order.  
Suffering from wakeful nights? Enjoying sake—that is, Japanese rice wine —may encourage 
sleep to come knocking. Sake has a higher alcohol content than table wine, typically around 18 
to 20 percent, but it’s said to be gentler on the stomach than other forms of alcohol—and that’s 
good to know if typical table wine doesn’t agree with you. Since it’s packed with amino acids, 
it’s even said to promote healthy skin when applied topically. (In creams and cosmetics, that is. 
Don’t wash your face with it.) In addition to the warm sake—which shouldn’t be heated over 
140 degrees, by the way—the Sake Racer includes an infusion of healing, soothing herbs, along 
with a bit of botanical gin and a final touch of rich plum wine for sweetness. Combined, these 
ingredients can offer asylum even from the most obstinate insomnia. Sayonara, sleeplessness!   _ 6 OUNCES (175 ML) WARM SAKE

Strain into a coupe glass, and top with a splash of the club soda. 
Finish with a couple drops of aromatic bitters of your choice. 
Preheat a mug by filling it with boiling water; discard the 
water after a few seconds. Pour the sake, plum wine, and gin 
in a large mug and stir gently; then let the tea ball steep in 
the mixture for at least five minutes. Remove the tea bag, and 
sip until sleep arrives like the moon over Mount Fuji.  NOTABLE NIGHTCAPS •

(Text)THOREAU COCKTAIL WITH WARM CRANBERRY, BLUEBERRY, AND SCOTCH
The original Thoreau Cocktail calls for botanical gin, but I find that Scotch, due to its depth 
of flavor, is an even better pairing for cranberries and blueberries. If at all possible, use wild 
Maine blueberries to mix up my Cocktail Whisperer’s twisted take on the Thoreau, a fruity, 
caffeine-free libation that’s so warming and soothing. Wild Maine blueberries are tiny—about 
the size of your fingernail, or even smaller—with an intense taste and great acidity, and I think 
they’re an excellent match for tart New England cranberries. Go ahead and use an inexpensive 
Scotch here: The crushed fruit and fresh citrus juice would mask the advantages of a pricey 
one. (Not that you need another excuse to use blueberries in your cocktails, but just in case: 
Blueberries are reputed to be “superfoods,” packed with disease-fighting antioxidants.) 
_ 1/4 CUP (35 G) EACH CRUSHED

combine. In a small saucepan, bring the water to the boil, and then 
add the cranberry and lime juices. Pour this heated cranberry juice 
over the muddled cranberry-blueberry mixture, and stir together. 
Divide between 2 preheated ceramic mugs, straining the cooked

straight whiskeys blended with neutral grain spirits plus flavorings and col-
orings. It’s much cheaper than single-malt or straight whiskeys, and is often 
used in cocktails where mixers tend to mask its taste. Single malt whiskeys are 
simply malt whiskeys made by a single distillery, while straight whiskey may 
be made from different barrels in different distilleries (although, in order to be 
called “straight whiskey” in the United States, the distilleries must all be located 
within the same state). Ultimately, single malt and straight whiskies are best if you’re planning on enjoying them neat or on the rocks, but it’s fine to use blended whiskey in cocktails with strong flavors, like the Thoreau. SIDENOTENOTABLE NIGHTCAPS •

(Text)HELP ME, MR. KENTISH! RUM TODDY FOR RESTLESS NIGHTS 
Comfort food is one of the best ways to nourish both body and soul after a long day. Well, here’s 
the mixological equivalent of mashed potatoes: whiskey-spiked bubble tea. Named for a brisk, 
efficient ship’s officer of the same name in a short story by Robert Louis Stevenson, it’s mightily 
effective when it comes to calming edgy minds and jittery bodies. Curiously, Tennessee sipping 
whiskey is a beguiling match for Chinese bubble tea, which is a combination of milk or coconut 
milk and slowly cooked tapioca, which has a sort of soft-to-the-tooth, gummy-bear consistency 
(minus the tooth-injuring texture, of course). I suggest using coconut-flavored bubble tea here, 
but feel free to use your own favorite flavor instead. Help yourself to a Help Me, Mr. Kentish! before bed: there’s nothing better when it comes to winding down and chilling out.  Hot rum cocktails aren’t just cold-weather cures. Sure, they’re warming and restorative, but 
they’re also well-known curatives for sleeplessness. Rum toddies like this one are simple to make, 
and deliver powerful healing to body and mind alike. This version calls for liberal dashes of 
highly alcoholic, aromatic bitters, which are said to relieve anxiety and insomnia by themselves. 
Here, they’re added to a base of tannic black tea that’s been topped up with a hearty dose of rum 
and lemon—a marriage made in heaven—and then sweetened with honey. (If the caffeine in tea 
keeps you up at night, just substitute with the decaf variety.) Like a warm blanket, the gentle 
heat and fragrance from this toddy will envelope you slowly, and sleep is sure to catch up with 
you fast._ 8 OUNCES (235 ML) COCONUT BUBBLE

(Text)THE THOMAS RILEY MARSHALL COCKTAILKRUPNIKAS AND HOT TEA 
Krupnikas, the unique herbal elixir indigenous to Lithuania, can be found in regions of the United 
States in which Lithuanian immigrants made their homes, such as Cleveland, Ohio, where winters 
tend to be long and frigid. Combat chills and restlessness with this simple, age-old remedy: Make 
yourself some steaming-hot black tea, then top with Krupnikas. Instant relaxation.
Depending on its terroir, Scotch whisky can taste richly earthy and spicy, followed by a long, 
vanilla-flavored finish. And it makes a smashing nightcap when it’s paired with peach brandy: 
its flavors of juicy, freshly crushed peaches bring out Scotch’s spicy sweetness. A final touch of 
curried bitters adds depth and more spice to this short, fragrant curative. Named for the U.S. 
vice president who said, infamously (and, one hopes, with his tongue firmly in his cheek), “What 
this country needs is a really good five-cent cigar,” The Thomas Riley Marshall features only a 
few ingredients, but its simplicity belies its depth—you’ll be enchanted by its spicy, sweet heat. _ 3 OUNCES (90 ML) KRUPNIKAS

Preheat a large mug by filling it with boiling water; discard the

Europe boasts a long tradition of using raw honey and potent, distilled alcohol

ordered when it comes to curing what ails you. Comprised of herbs, spices, 
and raw honey combined with alcoholic spirits of nearly 140-proof, Krupnikas 
can be sipped straight (although I don’t recommend it, unless you have an 
extremely stout constitution!) or enjoyed over ice with soda water and lemon in 
the summer. But it’s particularly conducive to cold weather, since you can use 
it to “correct” just about any hot liquid—like your favorite teas or infusions, a 
cup of coffee, or even a hot bowl of thick cabbage soup. SIDENOTE

(Text)LEAVES STRAINING AGAINST WINDFLEMINGTON COCKTAIL 
There’s little better than the delicious trinity of honey, stone fruits, and Scotch whisky when it 
comes to banishing the blues, and the sweet-tart, sage-strewn Flemington Cocktail puts this 
luscious preparation to good use. Make yourself one as an after-dinner treat, then kick back and 
relax until bedtime: You’ll slip off to sleep in a flash.
Picture this: it’s late autumn. The trees are nearly barren of leaves, and a single leaf hangs onto 
its branch by sheer willpower, despite the chill winds. You gaze up at the tenacious leaf, and 
meditate upon the past, the possibilities the future holds, and the truth inherent in the present

(Text)FLEMINGTON COCKTAIL 
There’s little better than the delicious trinity of honey, stone fruits, and Scotch whisky when it 
comes to banishing the blues, and the sweet-tart, sage-strewn Flemington Cocktail puts this 
luscious preparation to good use. Make yourself one as an after-dinner treat, then kick back and 
relax until bedtime: You’ll slip off to sleep in a flash.
Picture this: it’s late autumn. The trees are nearly barren of leaves, and a single leaf hangs onto 
its branch by sheer willpower, despite the chill winds. You gaze up at the tenacious leaf, and 
meditate upon the past, the possibilities the future holds, and the truth inherent in the present 
moment. Then you take a sip of this exquisite slurp—and while you might not reach immediate 
enlightenment, the stuff in your glass sure tastes good. A drink to be enjoyed oh-so-slowly,

(Text)ASSEMBLY BALL SHRUBB COCKTAILFERNET BRANCA SHOTS
Since its invention in nineteenth-century Italy, Fernet’s qualities as a soothing digestif after a 
large meal have spread far and wide—but it’s also one of the best hangover cures on the books. 
Made with dozens of herbs from all over the world, the recipe for Fernet Branca is top-secret, 
but we do know it has a great history as a fixer-upper for flagging spirits: A few ice-cold shots 
of Fernet are known to vanquish pesky hangovers nearly immediately. (Then again, the 80-proof 
spirits may also have something to do with it.) Either way, if you’ve got a gang of suffering 
houseguests on your hands, pour them a round of these neat treats on the morning (or afternoon) 
after: They’re nothing more than Fernet plus a ginger-beer crown, but they’ll leave your entourage 
wide-awake and ready to take on a new day—hangover-free.
As elegant as eveningwear, this simple citrusy cocktail is a celebration in a glass. It takes its name 
from the Assembly Ball, a debutante ball first held in Philadelphia in 1748. (Assembly Balls are 
still held in lots of communities around the country today.) I like to imagine our eighteenth-
century ancestors drinking a version of this effervescent cocktail at the event of the season—only,

(Text)FERNET BRANCA SHOTS
Since its invention in nineteenth-century Italy, Fernet’s qualities as a soothing digestif after a 
large meal have spread far and wide—but it’s also one of the best hangover cures on the books. 
Made with dozens of herbs from all over the world, the recipe for Fernet Branca is top-secret, 
but we do know it has a great history as a fixer-upper for flagging spirits: A few ice-cold shots 
of Fernet are known to vanquish pesky hangovers nearly immediately. (Then again, the 80-proof 
spirits may also have something to do with it.) Either way, if you’ve got a gang of suffering 
houseguests on your hands, pour them a round of these neat treats on the morning (or afternoon) 
after: They’re nothing more than Fernet plus a ginger-beer crown, but they’ll leave your entourage 
wide-awake and ready to take on a new day—hangover-free.
As elegant as eveningwear, this simple citrusy cocktail is a celebration in a glass. It takes its name 
from the Assembly Ball, a debutante ball first held in Philadelphia in 1748. (Assembly Balls are 
still held in lots of communities around the country today.) I like to imagine our eighteenth-
century ancestors drinking a version of this effervescent cocktail at the event of the season—only,

preserves in the absence of easily available fresh oranges. Luckily, you have a batch of my Italian

Tea is an essential ingredient in traditional punches, and my version is built upon a base of 
strong Chinese tea: I like lapsang souchong’s aromatic smokiness, and it’s such a good match 
both for Scotch and for Drambuie (which has a sort of honeyed, smoky flavor itself ). Then, 
equal measures of fresh citrus juices and my Blood Orange Shrub balance things out for a tangy, 
spirit-lifting elixir that’s sure to pep you up before your next game of croquet. A thoroughly 
modern examination of this quintessentially English beverage, my English Afternoon Punch 
will make a dozen or so of your closest friends very, very happy on a wet Saturday afternoon.

booze—is, relatively speaking, a newcomer to Western European and American 
traditions. (And, happily, it bears little to no resemblance to those corn-syrup- 
and additive-laden potions of the same name, which are usually preceded by 
the appellation “Hawaiian.”) A seventeenth-century import from India, punch in 
its original form was actually a cooling concoction that consisted of five simple 
ingredients: Alcohol, sugar, water, lemon, and tea. (In fact, the word “punch” is 
derived from the Sanskrit word for the number five.) In pre-seventeenth-century 
Britain, most punch-style drinks were wassails—that is, warmed, sweetened 
wine or ale, sometimes mixed with spices and fruit. But after Jamaican rum 
arrived on the scene around 1650, punches became the rum-driven crowd-pleas-
ers we know and love today. 
If you haven’t had a glass of punch since that particularly raucous party in your 
freshman year of college, now’s the time to reacquaint yourself with it. (In fact, 
since there are tapas bars in just about every major city these days, you’ve prob-
ably already enjoyed a glass or two of punch’s close cousin—sangria.) Punches 
have a couple special advantages: they tend to be slightly lower in alcohol than 
traditional cocktails, which means they’re lovely aperitifs—and plus, if you’re 
hosting a large group, it’s much easier to made a single bowl of punch than it 
is to make individual cocktails for each guest. So, check out the punch recipes in this chapter next time you’re planning a shindig; your guests are sure to love 
them all.SIDENOTETIPPLES FOR TOASTING •

(Text)ROASTED BEET BORSCHT WITH SOUR CREAM AND VODKABÉNÉDICTINE TWIST ELIXIR 
This elixir is just the thing when it comes to rousing the digestion after an especially rich meal. 
With its haunting notes of exotic spices and deeply aromatic Bénédictine, it tastes just medicinal 
enough to convince you that the liqueur is doing its healing work—and doing it well. Serve a round 
as a last course at your next dinner party: Your guests are sure to head home with happy bellies.
_ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) BÉNÉDICTINE
_ 2 TO 3 LEMON  
ZEST TWISTS 
_ ICE CUBE
_ 1 TO 2 OUNCES SELTZER WATER_ 3 POUNDS (1.4 KG) OF BEETS,  
ROASTED AND PUREED (CUT THE  
BEETS INTO CHUNKS, AND ROAST IN  
A 350°F (175°C) OVEN FOR 1 HOUR  
OR UNTIL COOKED THROUGH. THEN  
PUREE THEM IN A BLENDER OR FOOD  PROCESSOR UNTIL SMOOTH.)
_ 6 CUPS (1.5 L) STRONG BEEF  
BROTH (OR MORE TO TASTE, IF  
YOU PREFER A THINNER SOUP)
_ FRESHLY GRATED  
HORSERADISH, TO TASTE
_ VODKA
_ SOUR CREAMINGREDIENTSINGREDIENTS
DIRECTIONS
Add the Bénédictine and the lemon zest twists to a snifter glass. 
Pop one large ice cube into the glass, and top with the seltzer water. 
Angelica’s alimentary assets. The herb angelica, which is used 
in the production of spirits such as Bénédictine, chartreuse, gin, and vermouth, 
has been used as a natural stimulant for hundreds of years. In traditional 
Chinese medicine, it’s used to improve circulation and moderate blood pres-
sure, while Culpeper’s Herbal (1652) claims that it can “warm and comfort a cold 
stomach”—that is, stimulate digestion either before or after a meal. And it has 
been said to relieve illnesses of the respiratory system like colds, congestion, 
and coughs, too. All of this means that the Bénédictine Twist Elixir is just 
what the doctor ordered when it comes to restoring healthy digestion after an 
especially rich meal. SIDENOTE
In some of Europe’s colder regions, such as eastern Europe and Russia, home cooks add shots 
of vodka to the roasted-beet-based soup, borscht, then serve it up steaming hot in mugs to help 
defrost icy fingers. But no matter where in the world you are, borscht makes a sturdy, curative 
meal that’s the perfect remedy for damp, frigid weather. (Plus, borscht is a versatile devil: This 
soup can also be chilled, making for a healthy, refreshing meal in the hot summer months.) Here, 
it’s served up hot in shot glasses with just a nip of vodka for a diminutive yet restorative winter 
warmer. Serve to your chilly crowd après-ski.

With its haunting notes of exotic spices and deeply aromatic Bénédictine, it tastes just medicinal 
enough to convince you that the liqueur is doing its healing work—and doing it well. Serve a round

Add the Bénédictine and the lemon zest twists to a snifter glass. 
Pop one large ice cube into the glass, and top with the seltzer water. Add the beef broth to the pureed beets, using a bit more or less 
broth depending on how you prefer the soup’s consistency. Then 
mix in the horseradish, a little at a time, to taste. Carefully 
spoon the mixture into individual shot glasses (be careful: the 
bright-red beet puree stains fabrics). Add 1 medicine-dropperful 
of vodka to each shot glass. Top each with a small dollop of sour 
cream. Dig in, and let this Russian elixir perform its healing 
work upon body and soul. Makes 10 servings, plus leftovers. 
Angelica’s alimentary assets. The herb angelica, which is used 
in the production of spirits such as Bénédictine, chartreuse, gin, and vermouth, 
has been used as a natural stimulant for hundreds of years. In traditional 
Chinese medicine, it’s used to improve circulation and moderate blood pres -
sure, while Culpeper’s Herbal (1652) claims that it can “warm and comfort a cold 
stomach”—that is, stimulate digestion either before or after a meal. And it has 
been said to relieve illnesses of the respiratory system like colds, congestion, 
and coughs, too. All of this means that the Bénédictine Twist Elixir is just 
what the doctor ordered when it comes to restoring healthy digestion after an 
especially rich meal. 
In some of Europe’s colder regions, such as eastern Europe and Russia, home cooks add shots 
of vodka to the roasted-beet-based soup, borscht, then serve it up steaming hot in mugs to help 
defrost icy fingers. But no matter where in the world you are, borscht makes a sturdy, curative 
meal that’s the perfect remedy for damp, frigid weather. (Plus, borscht is a versatile devil: This 
soup can also be chilled, making for a healthy, refreshing meal in the hot summer months.) Here, 
it’s served up hot in shot glasses with just a nip of vodka for a diminutive yet restorative winter 
warmer. Serve to your chilly crowd après-ski. Vodka, one of the world’s most famous clear spirits, takes its name from 
the Russian phrase zhiznennaia voda, or “water of life.” It can be made from 
beets, potatoes, or grain (and connoisseurs consider the grain-based versions 
to be the best). And, like other spirits, it was often used medicinally in northern 
and eastern European countries: It was considered to be a powerful curative 
in its own right, and was also a valuable preservative for dozens of fragile, 
healing herbs that would otherwise lose their potency during the long winters. 
Traditionally, it’s served neat—for purists, mixers are unthinkable—and ice-
cold, too. But it’s so delicious when warmed in my Roasted Beet Borscht that I 
think even the most staunch traditionalists would forgive me! So lift your glass 
Russian-style and drink to your health. Ura!  SIDENOTETIPPLES FOR TOASTING •

_ ICE CUBESCitrus-laden rum punch was an early—and effective—curative for the evils of heat waves. In 
Caribbean areas such as Martinique or Haiti, both of which bear influences of French culture and 
its healing techniques, an apothecary would traditionally prescribe rum-based potions containing 
locally gathered herbs and spices, plus lashings of aromatic bitters. These healing potions would 
help soothe anyone who was suffering from the weather—even in the midst of the most oppressive heat and humidity. These medicinal “cocktails” evolved into rum punches, which are still made 
and enjoyed today. Combining fresh citrus juices with a healthy dose of light rum over ice and a 
whack of seltzer water, a bowl of punch is a delightful way to refresh and relax a crowd of thirsty 
revellers. (And it looks darned impressive, too.) 
INGREDIENTS DIRECTIONS
Fill a large punch bowl half full with ice. Pour the rum over the 
ice, adding the fruit juices one at a time, and mix well with a

(Text)TO THE DISFAVOR OF SOME GENTLEMEN PUNCH POPPA’S GOT A BRAND NEW BAG 
If they consider themselves to be purists, some whiskey-drinking gentlemen and gentlewomen 
might turn up their noses at the very idea of a whiskey-based punch. Are you one of them? 
Well, think again: this liquid pleasure trip is elegant, sophisticated, and subtly smoky. Grill your 
pineapple and citrus fruit before you juice it—the fruit becomes intensely, beguilingly sweet, and 
complements the smokiness that’s the hallmark of Tennessee sipping whiskey. Also, I recom-
mend saving yourself the headache the next morning: Use sparkling mineral water here instead 
of sparkling wine. You won’t miss the wine, since the grilled fruit/whiskey combo gives this 
Carribeanesque punch all the lift it needs. The grilling and juicing does require a couple extra steps, 
but it’s worth it. Take your time with this recipe, and build each layer of flavor into the punch. Your 
guests will thank you. Not every celebration involves a big crowd of rowdy revellers. Sometimes the best parties are 
the most intimate ones, so if you and a chum or two are in the mood to lift a glass to something 
special, you’re in the market for a round of Poppa’s Got A Brand New Bags. Get out your absinthe 
atomizer—you’ve got one, right?—and start by spraying two chilled coupe glasses with a sheen 
of absinthe. Then, you’ll want to reach for the best rum you can get your mitts on: I’m a huge 
fan of Mezan XO Jamaican Rum, which never, ever uses additives like caramel color, glycerin, or 
extra sugar. Showcase it here with a little maraschino liqueur, broiled citrus juices, and a dash of 
chocolate bitters: it’s luxury in a glass.

(Text)TO THE DISFAVOR OF SOME GENTLEMEN PUNCH POPPA’S GOT A BRAND NEW BAG 
If they consider themselves to be purists, some whiskey-drinking gentlemen and gentlewomen 
might turn up their noses at the very idea of a whiskey-based punch. Are you one of them? 
Well, think again: this liquid pleasure trip is elegant, sophisticated, and subtly smoky. Grill your 
pineapple and citrus fruit before you juice it—the fruit becomes intensely, beguilingly sweet, and 
complements the smokiness that’s the hallmark of Tennessee sipping whiskey. Also, I recom-
mend saving yourself the headache the next morning: Use sparkling mineral water here instead 
of sparkling wine. You won’t miss the wine, since the grilled fruit/whiskey combo gives this 
Carribeanesque punch all the lift it needs. The grilling and juicing does require a couple extra steps, 
but it’s worth it. Take your time with this recipe, and build each layer of flavor into the punch. Your 
guests will thank you. Not every celebration involves a big crowd of rowdy revellers. Sometimes the best parties are 
the most intimate ones, so if you and a chum or two are in the mood to lift a glass to something 
special, you’re in the market for a round of Poppa’s Got A Brand New Bags. Get out your absinthe 
atomizer—you’ve got one, right?—and start by spraying two chilled coupe glasses with a sheen 
of absinthe. Then, you’ll want to reach for the best rum you can get your mitts on: I’m a huge 
fan of Mezan XO Jamaican Rum, which never, ever uses additives like caramel color, glycerin, or 
extra sugar. Showcase it here with a little maraschino liqueur, broiled citrus juices, and a dash of 
chocolate bitters: it’s luxury in a glass.

(Text)THE JENKS FARM RESTORATIVE THE BROAD REACH 
Some of the best parties are the ones you didn’t plan on having in the first place. Everyone should  
have gone straight home after happy hour, but all of a sudden—and you’re not quite sure how 
it happened—there are thirteen thirsty people in your kitchen, and you’ve got to do something 
about it. But don’t panic. If you’ve got a good bottle of rum on hand, your problem’s pretty much 
solved. Shake up a few batches of The Broad Reach, a simple, rum-based cocktail that’s a fabulous 
crowd-pleaser. It’s nothing more than Mezan rum and a good-quality tangerine-flavored mixer, 
plus a secret ingredient: a dash of white balsamic vinegar. The vinegar acts as a sort of “instant 
shrub,” adding a bracing acidity that makes the Reach incredibly drinkable. This recipe serves two, 
but go ahead and double—or triple!—it, depending on the size of your crowd. 
_ 2 OUNCES (60 ML) MEZAN

INGREDIENTSINGREDIENTS
DIRECTIONS
Combine the first three ingredients in a Boston shaker 
three-quarters full of ice. Cap and shake hard for 15 seconds. 
Divide between two ice-filled Collins glasses. Squeeze a 
tangerine segment over the top of each, then plop it into the 
glass. Dot with the bitters, and serve immediately. Serves 2. 
We’ve all had those mornings: You had one too many cocktails the night before, you finally hit 
the sack at some unknown but ungodly hour, and now your stressed-out belly can’t stomach 
your usual cup of coffee—or, heaven help us, food. That’s where The Jenks Farm Restorative, 
a powerful breakfast-time cocktail, comes in. It’s a healing concoction of white whiskey and 
iced coffee laced with heavy cream and sweet vanilla syrup, served over crushed ice—and it’s 
best made by the pitcherful, because it goes down so very quickly and easily. The moonshine 
provides a little hair of the proverbial dog to calm shattered nerves, while the chilled coffee gets 
much-needed caffeine into your system, fast. Don’t skip the freshly grated nutmeg—inhaling 
nutmeg’s warm, heady scent is like aromatherapy for hangover sufferers.

of friends both near and far. Serves 4 aching heads.

it’s a mistake we’ve all made before. Picture this, and tell me if it doesn’t sound 
familiar: You’re in the kitchen or at the bar, and the recipe you’re making—like 
the Jenks Farm Restorative—calls for fresh cream. Happily, you’ve got a carton 
to hand, so you toss in the required amount—blissfully unaware that the cream 
has gone sour on you. Devastated, you have to chuck out the whole drink or 
dish—and there’s nothing more aggravating than waste. There’s only one 
solution: Always, always, always taste your cream before you use it, even if it’s 
within its sell-by date. (Simply smelling it isn’t enough: use a clean spoon to 
place a drop or two on your tongue.)  It’s such a simple thing, but it’s sure to 
save you time, money, and stress. (You can thank me later.) SIDENOTETIPPLES FOR TOASTING •

DIRECTIONS
Combine the first three ingredients in a Boston shaker 
three-quarters full of ice. Cap and shake hard for 15 seconds. 
Divide between two ice-filled Collins glasses. Squeeze a 
tangerine segment over the top of each, then plop it into the 
glass. Dot with the bitters, and serve immediately. Serves 2. 
We’ve all had those mornings: You had one too many cocktails the night before, you finally hit 
the sack at some unknown but ungodly hour, and now your stressed-out belly can’t stomach 
your usual cup of coffee—or, heaven help us, food. That’s where The Jenks Farm Restorative, 
a powerful breakfast-time cocktail, comes in. It’s a healing concoction of white whiskey and 
iced coffee laced with heavy cream and sweet vanilla syrup, served over crushed ice—and it’s 
best made by the pitcherful, because it goes down so very quickly and easily. The moonshine 
provides a little hair of the proverbial dog to calm shattered nerves, while the chilled coffee gets 
much-needed caffeine into your system, fast. Don’t skip the freshly grated nutmeg—inhaling 
nutmeg’s warm, heady scent is like aromatherapy for hangover sufferers.

Some of the best parties are the ones you didn’t plan on having in the first place. Everyone should  
have gone straight home after happy hour, but all of a sudden—and you’re not quite sure how 
it happened—there are thirteen thirsty people in your kitchen, and you’ve got to do something 
about it. But don’t panic. If you’ve got a good bottle of rum on hand, your problem’s pretty much 
solved. Shake up a few batches of The Broad Reach, a simple, rum-based cocktail that’s a fabulous 
crowd-pleaser. It’s nothing more than Mezan rum and a good-quality tangerine-flavored mixer, 
plus a secret ingredient: a dash of white balsamic vinegar. The vinegar acts as a sort of “instant 
shrub,” adding a bracing acidity that makes the Reach incredibly drinkable. This recipe serves two, 
but go ahead and double—or triple!—it, depending on the size of your crowd. _ 6 OUNCES (175 ML) WHITE WHISKEY

it’s a mistake we’ve all made before. Picture this, and tell me if it doesn’t sound 
familiar: You’re in the kitchen or at the bar, and the recipe you’re making—like 
the Jenks Farm Restorative—calls for fresh cream. Happily, you’ve got a carton 
to hand, so you toss in the required amount—blissfully unaware that the cream 
has gone sour on you. Devastated, you have to chuck out the whole drink or 
dish—and there’s nothing more aggravating than waste. There’s only one 
solution: Always, always, always taste your cream before you use it, even if it’s 
within its sell-by date. (Simply smelling it isn’t enough: use a clean spoon to 
place a drop or two on your tongue.)  It’s such a simple thing, but it’s sure to 
save you time, money, and stress. (You can thank me later.) SIDENOTETIPPLES FOR TOASTING •

(Text)DAVID BALFOUR COCKTAILDR. SOMERSET’S CURE
Named for the resourceful protagonist of Robert Louis Stevenson’s novel, Kidnapped, this 
refreshing tipple is just as enterprising. Its simple ingredients make it easy to prepare in a flash, 
and they also travel well in a go-cup, if you want to save your portion of David Balfour for later 
on. Make your own lemonade with freshly squeezed lemon juice, some cool spring water, simple 
syrup, and some torn fresh mint—then zest it up with orange bitters and a healthy pour of Irish 
whiskey. (I recommend trying a few different varieties of orange bitters before you settle on one 
that really resonates with you: There’re lots of versions available on the market.) Mix up a jug of 
David B. to take with you on your next picnic, barbeque, or trip to the beach: It goes wonderfully 
with just about all lunchtime noshes.  In Robert Louis Stevenson’s short story, “The Superfluous Mansion,” one character inquires 
of another, “‘Have you a drop of Brandy… I am sick.’” It’s not an unreasonable request. After 
all, back in the day, brandy was thought to be medicinal and a restorative—so if you needed an 
excuse to treat yourself to a brandy-laced cocktail, look no further. Dr. Somerset’s Cure features 
both brandy and French whisky, which is often aged in casks that once held cognac. The result 
is a softly oaked spirit that’s truly the stuff of dreams. Here, it’s buttressed by a melange of 
flavors, including calvados, a bit of inexpensive pomace or marc brandy, roasted apricots, orange 
segments, and fresh lemon juice. Do mix up a few Cures next time you’re hosting a couple close

(Text)THE SQUIRE’S STRAWBERRY-RHUBARB SHRUBSCURVY KNAVE SHRUB PUNCH 
Back in the age of sail, vitamin C–laden fruits, like lemons and limes, were precious cargo: 
They could keep seagoing men from contracting scurvy, a painful and often fatal disease. Ship 
cooks would boil lime juice, ginger root, sugar, and vinegar until they formed a thick syrup that, 
coincidentally, was delicious when mixed with rum. That way, sailors could get a dose of much-
needed vitamin C—with a bit of a kick. Use the best rum you can afford: if you use poor-quality 
industrial-grade rum, you’ll feel more than a little seasick the next morning yourself. (And your 
guests will be wont to give you a bath in the warm bilge water inside the keel of your ship.) A 
“Scurvy Knave” is a less-than-sympathetic term for someone in the throes of the disease, but don’t 
worry: a cup or two of this potent punch is a sure cure.
It’s true, the Squire’s Shrub does require a couple of extra steps, but I promise it’s worth your 
while: Y our patience will be rewarded with a lush, crimson-colored syrup that’s straight out 
of the eighteenth century, when America was in its infancy and early pharmacists would have 
relied on their gardens to supply the basis for their healing tonics. (Rhubarb has been used as a 
digestive aid for thousands of years.) There’s nothing difficult to it, though, beyond a little extra 
mixing, and roasting your fruit before making the shrub. The vinegar’s high acidity cuts through 
the sumptuous, charred, caramelized flavor of the roasted strawberries and rhubarb, making it 
a terribly seductive addition to gin, vodka, and rum-based libations. Use it to make up a couple 
rounds of the Squire’s Shrub Cocktail (see page 310) at your next warm-weather soiree._ 4 OUNCES (120 ML) DARK RUM

bowl, pour the fruit-sugar mixture into the strainer, and use a wooden 
spoon to mash the mixture in order to release as much liquid as possible. 
(Reserve the mashed fruit to use in cooking or baking, if you like.) Add 
the balsamic vinegar to the liquid, stir, and let the mixture sit for a few 
hours. Funnel into sterilized bottles or jars, and age for 3–4 weeks in the 
refrigerator. This shrub will last nearly indefinitely, but if it begins to 
quiver, dance, or speak in foreign languages, throw it out immediately.TIPPLES FOR TOASTING •

(Text)THE SQUIRE’S STRAWBERRY-RHUBARB SHRUBSCURVY KNAVE SHRUB PUNCH 
Back in the age of sail, vitamin C–laden fruits, like lemons and limes, were precious cargo: 
They could keep seagoing men from contracting scurvy, a painful and often fatal disease. Ship 
cooks would boil lime juice, ginger root, sugar, and vinegar until they formed a thick syrup that, 
coincidentally, was delicious when mixed with rum. That way, sailors could get a dose of much-
needed vitamin C—with a bit of a kick. Use the best rum you can afford: if you use poor-quality 
industrial-grade rum, you’ll feel more than a little seasick the next morning yourself. (And your 
guests will be wont to give you a bath in the warm bilge water inside the keel of your ship.) A 
“Scurvy Knave” is a less-than-sympathetic term for someone in the throes of the disease, but don’t 
worry: a cup or two of this potent punch is a sure cure.
It’s true, the Squire’s Shrub does require a couple of extra steps, but I promise it’s worth your 
while: Y our patience will be rewarded with a lush, crimson-colored syrup that’s straight out 
of the eighteenth century, when America was in its infancy and early pharmacists would have 
relied on their gardens to supply the basis for their healing tonics. (Rhubarb has been used as a 
digestive aid for thousands of years.) There’s nothing difficult to it, though, beyond a little extra 
mixing, and roasting your fruit before making the shrub. The vinegar’s high acidity cuts through 
the sumptuous, charred, caramelized flavor of the roasted strawberries and rhubarb, making it 
a terribly seductive addition to gin, vodka, and rum-based libations. Use it to make up a couple 
rounds of the Squire’s Shrub Cocktail (see page 310) at your next warm-weather soiree._ 4 OUNCES (120 ML) DARK RUM

(Text)THE SQUIRE’S SHRUB COCKTAIL
Get ready to try another twisted take on the French 75, that timeless combination of gin, cham-
pagne, lemon juice, and simple syrup. This version is actually a hybrid of the French 75 and 
the traditional champagne cocktail, which calls for a bitters-moistened sugar cube, brandy, and 
a heady top of champagne. Fuse the two together, add a healthy whack of tart, fruity Squire’s 
Shrub, and you’ve got a cocktail that’ll make your guests’ knees tremble. In the same way that 
alchemists of old strove to turn base metals into gold, champagne can turn a plain old Tuesday 
into a full-on, hat-waving celebration: Be sure to keep a bottle on hand so you can whip these 
up the next time you find yourself hosting an impromptu shindig. When that happens, make a 
few batches of the Squire’s, if you dare—just keep that bottle of Fernet Branca on hand for the 
morning after. Basic Simple Syrup Add 1 cup (235 ml) of boiling water 
to 1 cup (200 g) of bar sugar or caster sugar and mix until sugar 
has dissolved. Let the mixture cool. Keep refrigerated in an 
airtight container for up to a month. 
Berry Vodka Infusion  Place 1 cup (145 g) of elderberries 
in 1/2 cup (120 ml) of blackberry brandy. Add 6 ounces (175 ml) 
of vodka and combine well. Cover with plastic wrap. Keep the 
mixture in the refrigerator for 2 days, then puree the mixture in 
a blender or food processor, and strain it through cheesecloth. 
Keep refrigerated in an airtight container: It’ll last for months.
Blueberry Simple Syrup  Simply puree 1 pint (300 g) of 
blueberries (preferably Maine wild blueberries, if you can get 
them), then sweeten to taste with Raw Honey Simple Syrup (see 
above). Let cool. Store in the refrigerator for 1 month.  
Bosc Pear “Shrub” Simple Syrup  Finely dice 2 Bosc 
pears, and combine them with 1 cup (235 ml) Basic Simple 
Syrup (see above), 1/2 cup (120 ml) Japanese rice wine vinegar 
and 1/2 cup (120 ml) mirin. Add to a small saucepan, and bring 
to a simmer, then remove from heat, let cool, cover, and let the 
mixture sit overnight at cellar temperature. Strain, then use in 
your shrub.
Captain John Silver’s Quick Celery Pickle  Wash 
a package of organic celery well, and change the water several 
times to eliminate any clinging grit. Trim the celery and cut 
it into small coins. Combine 1/2 cup (120 ml) mirin, 1/2 cup 
(120 ml) rice wine vinegar, and 1 cup (200 g) of Vietnamese 
palm sugar: this should be enough to cover the celery. (Add 
a few slivers of Thai chilies for extra flavor, if you like.) Add 1 
teaspoon of black peppercorns, smashed with the side of a 
chef’s knife, and 2–3 lemon zest twists. Cover and refrigerate 
for 2 days, stirring the mixture daily to ensure that the celery is 
covered with liquid, and adding more mirin if necessary. Store 
in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 1 month. 
Cardamom Simple Syrup  Make a batch of Basic 
Simple Syrup (above) and pour it into a medium-sized bowl. 
Add 2 to 3 crushed cardamom pods to the mixture and let 
it cool. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, place it in the 
refrigerator, and let the pods steep in the syrup for 1 to 2
 days. Remove the cardamom pods, and keep refrigerated in 
an airtight container for up to a month._ 1 BROWN SUGAR CUBE

freshly grated nutmeg, Chinese five-spice mix, star anise, 
fennel seeds, and cardamom pods in a very large mixing bowl. 
Add 375 ml (half of a 750 ml bottle) Spanish sherry (oloroso 
sherry works best because of its nutty, boldly assertive flavors); 
1 750ml bottle of clear grain alcohol, such as Everclear; and 16 ounces (455 g) raw honey. Mix well. Then divide the mixture 
between two 1-quart (946 ml) Mason jars with tight rubber

a few slivers of Thai chilies for extra flavor, if you like.) Add 1 
teaspoon of black peppercorns, smashed with the side of a 
chef’s knife, and 2–3 lemon zest twists. Cover and refrigerate 
for 2 days, stirring the mixture daily to ensure that the celery is 
covered with liquid, and adding more mirin if necessary. Store 
in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 1 month. 
Cardamom Simple Syrup  Make a batch of Basic 
Simple Syrup (above) and pour it into a medium-sized bowl. 
Add 2 to 3 crushed cardamom pods to the mixture and let

freshly grated nutmeg, Chinese five-spice mix, star anise, 
fennel seeds, and cardamom pods in a very large mixing bowl. 
Add 375 ml (half of a 750 ml bottle) Spanish sherry (oloroso 
sherry works best because of its nutty, boldly assertive flavors); 
1 750ml bottle of clear grain alcohol, such as Everclear; and 16 ounces (455 g) raw honey. Mix well. Then divide the mixture 
between two 1-quart (946 ml) Mason jars with tight rubber 
seals and sturdy glass tops. Store in the fridge or a cool, dark 
place, and shake vigorously twice daily for 1–2 months. Strain 
the mixture through cheesecloth to remove the spices, and then funnel into small, sterilized bottles. Use wherever bitters 
are called for in your food and drink.
Curried Bitters  Add 1 teaspoon (5 g) of curry powder 
to 3 tablespoons (45 g) of Angostura Bitters and mix well. 
Refrigerate and store indefinitely.

(Text)Ginger Syrup Add 1 cup (200 g) of syrup to 1 cup (235 ml) 
of boiling water. Grate 8 oz. of ginger root into the mixture, and 
then let it stand for a couple of days. Strain, and now you have 
ginger syrup. Keep refrigerated in an airtight container for up 
to a month. 
Grilled Citrus Juices To make 1 cup (235 ml) of each 
citrus juice: Orange: Cut 2 to 3 oranges into 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) 
thick slices. Place the slices on a grill or grill pan, and cook 
until char marks appear on the flesh of the fruit. Grapefruit: Cut 
1 to 2 grapefruits into 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) thick slices. Place the 
slices on a grill or grill pan, and cook until char marks appear 
on the flesh of the fruit. Pineapple: Slice 1 pineapple into 
wedges 1/2-inch (1.25 cm) thick, removing the rind. Place the 
slices on a grill or grill pan, and cook until char marks appear 
on the flesh of the fruit.
TO JUICE:  Remove any peel or rind that may remain on the 
fruit. Cut into pieces small enough to fit into a juicer, and put 
them one at a time into the juicer. Strain the juices before using. 
Store them in airtight containers for up to a week.  
Healing Herb Simple Syrup Make a batch of simple 
syrup (above) and pour it into a medium-sized bowl. Place 
the assorted herbs into a cheesecloth bag and tie tightly with 
string. Submerge the cheesecloth bag in the simple syrup—let 
the string hang outside of the bowl, like a teabag, for easy 
removal—cover the bowl with plastic wrap, place it in the 
refrigerator, and let the herbs steep in the syrup for 1 to 2 
days. Remove the cheesecloth bag of herbs before using. Keep 
refrigerated in an airtight container for up to a month. 
Homemade Grenadine Syrup Combine 2 ounces (60 
ml) Basic Simple Syrup, 2 cups (475 ml) pomegranate juice, and 
1/4 teaspoon each nutmeg, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper in a 
medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat and 
continue to simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Allow the mixture to cool, and then use a funnel to transfer it to a glass bottle. Add 
no more than four drops of orange water—and, if you like, some 
overproof rum or vodka for extra zip. 
Homemade Lemonade Warm 10 cups (2.4 L) of spring 
water in a large saucepan until just below simmering. Then add 
1 cup (340 g) raw honey, and stir until dissolved. Let cool. Add 
the juice of 8 lemons. Pour the mixture into a large pitcher, 
and add a big handful of fresh mint. Chill in the refrigerator 
for a few hours before serving.
Homemade Whipped Cream  Combine 1 pint (473 
ml) of heavy whipping cream with 2 tablespoons (26 g) of 
confectioner’s sugar. (To make Coffee Whipped Cream, add 1 
tablespoon (13 g) of powdered espresso coffee. To make Cognac 
Whipped Cream, add a few drops of cognac.) Whip with a whisk 
until it's a softly creamy, almost pourable, consistency. Lemon Balm Simple Syrup  Make a batch of simple 
syrup (above) and pour it into a medium-sized bowl. Add 10 to 
12 torn lemon balm leaves to the mixture and let it cool. Cover 
the bowl with plastic wrap, place it in the refrigerator, and 
let the lemon balm steep in the syrup for 1 to 2 days. Strain 
before using, and add up to 2 ounces (60 ml) of botanical gin 
as a preservative, if desired. Keep refrigerated in an airtight 
container for up to a month. 
Luscious Asian Fruit Puree Peel and deseed 1

processor, and then press through a fine sieve to remove any 
remaining skin or seeds. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. 
Luscious Grilled Lemonade Remove the wax from 8 
lemons, and cut them into 1/2 inch (1.3-cm) rounds. Combine 
1/2 cup (170 g) raw honey and 1/2 cup (120 ml) water in a bowl, 
and dip the lemon rounds into the mixture. Sprinkle the lemon 
rounds with a pinch of sea salt, then char them lightly over 
indirect heat on a wood grill. Let them cool, then juice them 
and follow the directions for my Homemade Lemonade, above. 
Orange Simple Syrup  In a medium saucepan, combine 
1 cup (20 g) sugar, 1/2 cup (120 ml) freshly squeezed orange 
juice (strained), and 2 tablespoons (12 g) grated orange zest, 
and 1/2 cup (120 ml) water. Simmer, mixing until the sugar has 
dissolved. Let the mixture cool. Strain before using, and keep 
refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. 
Quick Roasted Tomato-Celery Puree  Preheat 
your oven to 400ºF (200ºC, or gas mark 6). Slice about 12 ripe 
tomatoes, and cut the stalks from a package of well-washed 
celery into coins. Drizzle a little olive oil over the tomatoes and celery, sprinkle them with sea salt, and roast for 1 hour.  Let 
the vegetables cool, and then puree them in a blender.  
Quince Puree Preheat your oven to 250°F (120°C, or gas 
mark 1/2). Cut 1 quince into 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) chunks, and place on a baking tray. (Be careful when slicing the quince: 
It’s rock-hard, and your knife can slip easily, leading to nasty 
kitchen accidents! Be sure to secure your cutting board first by 
placing a wet dish towel underneath it.) Roast the quince for at 
least 4 hours, until soft. When cool, put the quince into a food 
mill in order to remove the skin and the bitter pits. Reserve 
as much of the liquid as possible. Refrigerate in an airtight 
container for up to a week.   
Raw Honey Simple Syrup  Add 1 cup (235 ml) of boiling 
water to 1 cup (340 g) raw honey and mix until honey has 
dissolved. Let the mixture cool. Keep refrigerated in an airtight 
container for up to a month. Roasted Stone Fruits  Line a baking tray with parchment 
paper, and preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C, or gas mark 2). 
Slice 1 pound (455 g) assorted stone fruits, such as peaches, 
plums, and/or apricots, in half (pits removed). Sprinkle with 
demerara sugar, and roast slowly for 3 hours. Let the stone 
fruits cool overnight in as much of their own liquid as possible. 
Drizzle Raw Honey Simple Syrup (see above) over them to keep 
moist. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 
a week (any longer and they tend to get fuzzy!) 
Roasted Strawberries and Rhubarb First, hull 
1 pound (455 g) of strawberries, and wash 1 pound (455 g) of 
rhubarb stalks. Chop the rhubarb into 1 inch (2.5-cm) chunks. 
Preheat your oven to 400ºF (200ºC, or gas mark 6), and place 
the fruit into a cast-iron roasting pan. Roast for 30 minutes, 
then reduce the temperature to 300ºF (150ºC, or gas mark 2) 
and continue to roast for another 30 minutes. Let cool. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. 
Roasted Tomato Puree Preheat the oven to 400ºF 
(200ºC). Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Toss 1 pound (455 g) of grape tomatoes with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive 
oil and a dash of salt. Arrange the tomatoes on the baking tray, 
and roast for half an hour. Then turn the heat down to 250ºF 
(120ºC) and slow-cook them until melted, about 3 hours. (Keep 
an eye on them. If they start to burn, turn the heat down, but 
be patient. You want the tomatoes to melt, not burn.) When 
the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, puree them either 
in a food processor or with a mortar and pestle to make a 
relatively smooth liquid. Add 2 to 4 tablespoons (30 to 60 g) of 
horseradish (freshly-grated is best, if you can get it), several 
squeezes of fresh lemon juice, and a dash of celery salt. Store 
in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. 
Root Tea Simple Syrup  Combine 4 ounces (120 ml) of 
organic root tea liqueur with 1/2 cup (100 g) bar sugar and 1 cup 
(235 ml) boiling water. When the sugar has dissolved, let the 
mixture cool, and keep refrigerated in an airtight container for 
up to a month. 
Rose-Infused Simple Syrup Place 2 to 3 organic red 
rose petals into a cheesecloth bag and tie tightly with string 
(use organic rose petals only). Pour 1 cup (235 ml) simple syrup 
into a small bowl, then submerge the cheesecloth bag in bowl; 
cover it with plastic wrap; and store in the refrigerator over-
night. Remove the cheesecloth bag before using. Alternatively, 
combine 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of rosewater (be sure to use the edible kind!) with 1 cup (235 ml) of simple syrup in a small 
bowl, and store in the refrigerator overnight before using. Keep 
refrigerated in an airtight container for up to a month.

dissolved. Let the mixture cool. Strain before using, and keep 
refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. 
Quick Roasted Tomato-Celery Puree  Preheat 
your oven to 400ºF (200ºC, or gas mark 6). Slice about 12 ripe 
tomatoes, and cut the stalks from a package of well-washed 
celery into coins. Drizzle a little olive oil over the tomatoes and celery, sprinkle them with sea salt, and roast for 1 hour.  Let 
the vegetables cool, and then puree them in a blender.  
Quince Puree Preheat your oven to 250°F (120°C, or gas 
mark 1/2). Cut 1 quince into 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) chunks, and place on a baking tray. (Be careful when slicing the quince: 
It’s rock-hard, and your knife can slip easily, leading to nasty 
kitchen accidents! Be sure to secure your cutting board first by 
placing a wet dish towel underneath it.) Roast the quince for at 
least 4 hours, until soft. When cool, put the quince into a food 
mill in order to remove the skin and the bitter pits. Reserve 
as much of the liquid as possible. Refrigerate in an airtight 
container for up to a week.   
Raw Honey Simple Syrup  Add 1 cup (235 ml) of boiling 
water to 1 cup (340 g) raw honey and mix until honey has 
dissolved. Let the mixture cool. Keep refrigerated in an airtight 
container for up to a month. Roasted Stone Fruits  Line a baking tray with parchment 
paper, and preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C, or gas mark 2). 
Slice 1 pound (455 g) assorted stone fruits, such as peaches, 
plums, and/or apricots, in half (pits removed). Sprinkle with 
demerara sugar, and roast slowly for 3 hours. Let the stone 
fruits cool overnight in as much of their own liquid as possible. 
Drizzle Raw Honey Simple Syrup (see above) over them to keep 
moist. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 
a week (any longer and they tend to get fuzzy!) 
Roasted Strawberries and Rhubarb First, hull 
1 pound (455 g) of strawberries, and wash 1 pound (455 g) of 
rhubarb stalks. Chop the rhubarb into 1 inch (2.5-cm) chunks. 
Preheat your oven to 400ºF (200ºC, or gas mark 6), and place 
the fruit into a cast-iron roasting pan. Roast for 30 minutes, 
then reduce the temperature to 300ºF (150ºC, or gas mark 2) 
and continue to roast for another 30 minutes. Let cool. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. 
Roasted Tomato Puree Preheat the oven to 400ºF 
(200ºC). Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Toss 1 pound (455 g) of grape tomatoes with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive 
oil and a dash of salt. Arrange the tomatoes on the baking tray, 
and roast for half an hour. Then turn the heat down to 250ºF 
(120ºC) and slow-cook them until melted, about 3 hours. (Keep 
an eye on them. If they start to burn, turn the heat down, but 
be patient. You want the tomatoes to melt, not burn.) When 
the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, puree them either 
in a food processor or with a mortar and pestle to make a 
relatively smooth liquid. Add 2 to 4 tablespoons (30 to 60 g) of 
horseradish (freshly-grated is best, if you can get it), several 
squeezes of fresh lemon juice, and a dash of celery salt. Store 
in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. 
Root Tea Simple Syrup  Combine 4 ounces (120 ml) of 
organic root tea liqueur with 1/2 cup (100 g) bar sugar and 1 cup 
(235 ml) boiling water. When the sugar has dissolved, let the 
mixture cool, and keep refrigerated in an airtight container for 
up to a month. 
Rose-Infused Simple Syrup Place 2 to 3 organic red 
rose petals into a cheesecloth bag and tie tightly with string 
(use organic rose petals only). Pour 1 cup (235 ml) simple syrup 
into a small bowl, then submerge the cheesecloth bag in bowl; 
cover it with plastic wrap; and store in the refrigerator over-
night. Remove the cheesecloth bag before using. Alternatively, 
combine 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of rosewater (be sure to use the edible kind!) with 1 cup (235 ml) of simple syrup in a small 
bowl, and store in the refrigerator overnight before using. Keep 
refrigerated in an airtight container for up to a month.
Rosemary Simple Syrup  Make a batch of Basic Simple 
Syrup (see above). Crumble a handful of rosemary leaves, place 
them in a cheesecloth bag, and submerge the bag in the Basic

(Text)Lemon Balm Simple Syrup  Make a batch of simple 
syrup (above) and pour it into a medium-sized bowl. Add 10 to 
12 torn lemon balm leaves to the mixture and let it cool. Cover 
the bowl with plastic wrap, place it in the refrigerator, and 
let the lemon balm steep in the syrup for 1 to 2 days. Strain 
before using, and add up to 2 ounces (60 ml) of botanical gin 
as a preservative, if desired. Keep refrigerated in an airtight 
container for up to a month. 
Luscious Asian Fruit Puree Peel and deseed 1 
orange, 1 jackfruit, 1 Asian pear, and 1 starfruit. Puree in a food 
processor, and then press through a fine sieve to remove any 
remaining skin or seeds. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. 
Luscious Grilled Lemonade Remove the wax from 8 
lemons, and cut them into 1/2 inch (1.3-cm) rounds. Combine 
1/2 cup (170 g) raw honey and 1/2 cup (120 ml) water in a bowl, 
and dip the lemon rounds into the mixture. Sprinkle the lemon 
rounds with a pinch of sea salt, then char them lightly over 
indirect heat on a wood grill. Let them cool, then juice them 
and follow the directions for my Homemade Lemonade, above. 
Orange Simple Syrup  In a medium saucepan, combine 
1 cup (20 g) sugar, 1/2 cup (120 ml) freshly squeezed orange 
juice (strained), and 2 tablespoons (12 g) grated orange zest, 
and 1/2 cup (120 ml) water. Simmer, mixing until the sugar has 
dissolved. Let the mixture cool. Strain before using, and keep

teaspoon cayenne pepper. Pour the mixture into an airtight

Spicy Pickled Cucumber Garnish  Slice a European 
cucumber lengthwise. Combine with 1/2 cup (120 ml) white 
vinegar, a few shards of sliced red chiles, 1 tablespoon (15 g) 
sugar, and 1 teaspoon sea salt. Cover tightly and store in the 
fridge overnight. Pour off the marinade, and use the pickled 
cucumber slices as garnishes for your cocktails. 
Spicy Simple Syrup In a medium saucepan, combine 
2 cups (400 g) of sugar with 1 cup (235 ml) of water and bring 
to a boil, mixing until the sugar has dissolved. Let the mixture

Basic Simple Syrup (see above). Finish with a pinch of freshly 
grated nutmeg.
