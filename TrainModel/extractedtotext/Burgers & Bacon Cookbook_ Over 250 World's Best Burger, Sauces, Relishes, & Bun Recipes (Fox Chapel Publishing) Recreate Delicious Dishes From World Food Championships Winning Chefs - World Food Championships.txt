Introduction
A FEW YEARS AGO, I SET OUT INTO THE WORLD WITH 
two ultimately successful and intertwined missions. The first 
was writing a travel cookbook called Cooking with Spices . 
The second was completing the Continent Grand Slam: visi-
ting all seven continents in one calendar year. In Antarctica, 
the landscape was breathtaking and otherworldly, even if our culinary pano-
rama was limited to our vessel’s galley, lest we end up like Ernest Shackleton 
and made to survive on penguin. Charles and Miranda Shackleton, relatives 
of the famous explorer, happened to be on the same expedition trip. Upon our 
return to the tip of South America, they invited me to their farm in Vermont to 
finish the final chapters of the book, and I duly obliged.
People invite me into their homes and feed me quite often. You might say 
it’s luck, but it keeps occurring. It coincidentally is also my preference to 
be had over for dinner versus attending a stuffy, crowded tourist attraction. 
Besides, I usually find the layout of a local kitchen to be more culturally indic -
ative than the region’s highest art or classic architecture. It is in those cooking 
spaces that the secrets to what is really valued are revealed, usually to my 
pleasant surprise. Marveling at how pans are stored, or how the boxy cheese 
grater is identical to my Nonna’s in Italy, are paramount cultural indicators 
from my perspective and how I get my kicks.
It is in this spirit that this book is written. I was told when I was quite young 
that you are who you surround yourself with. That seemed like an easy way to 
become a good, interesting person, as long as I was successful in finding good, 
interesting people and convincing them to let me stick around. Thankfully, 
you’ll find such individuals between the covers of this book. Hopefully, people 
will keep opening their homes to me, feeding me, and teaching me the stories 
of their place, their family, and their kitchen. This book is a conduit to open 
those homes, and my own, to you—  to share, as so many have done with me.XII
 | INTROd UCTIONThe Family of Sauces
Why sauces? As the saying goes, “What’s sauce for the goose is sauce for 
the gander.” While I wouldn’t say sauces are a cultural universal, as are 
proverbs, they do have a widespread dispersion that’s worthy of reverential 
contemplation. This book, in particular, takes you around the world of sauces 
with a traveler’s mentality. On the road in a foreign land, seeing everything is 
impossible. If you try, you miss what is truly unique about a place. Books with 
400- plus recipes claim to be exhaustive, yet many of them don’t have Khoresh 
Fesenjoon (page 82) or Jajik (page 80). Are they truly acquainted with Persian 
cuisine? Have they been in the kitchen, or did they just go to the monuments?
Then there are the French mother sauces that require acknowledgment 
but have been comprehensively covered elsewhere. They form a necessary 
foundation to understand a certain side of how we use sauces in modern 
Western  cuisine, and I’ve given you simple versions of a few of them starting 
on page xiii (along with recipes for stock and a basic mayonnaise). However, 
my hope is that you’ll also devour keenly the recipes that are more difficult to 
pronounce. The rewards, I promise, will be boundless.
A recipe like Sambel Ulek (page 30) is a sugar- free candidate to replace 
your store- bought sriracha. Instead of run- of- the- mill plum sauce, make 
Tkemali (page 74) from Georgia, cooking it down to your desired thickness. 
When Georgian cuisine breaks into mainstream consciousness in the coming 
years (look it up; it’s imminent), you’ll be able to extoll the multipurpose 
virtues of blue fenugreek. This work curates a selection of sauces chosen 
primarily for versatility.
Distinguishing between a sauce and a dish can be tricky. My Nonna would 
not consider her ragù a sauce. Instead, ravioli con ragù is a dish . Nonetheless, 
her tomato sauce that serves as the source of Ragù della Nonna (page 108) is 
so versatile that I’ve made it with llama meat and gotten the nod of approval 
from my Italian mother.XIII INTROd UCTION |Classic Sauces
Béchamel  // MAKES ABOUT 2 CUPS
2½ cups whole milk
4 tablespoons unsalted butter or 
clarified butter
4 tablespoons all- purpose flourSalt
Ground white pepper
Freshly grated nutmeg
1. In a medium saucepan over low heat, heat the milk until just before it scalds, 
about 2 to 5 minutes. Take it off the heat when you start to see little bubbles 
form around the edges. Set aside.
2. In a large, heavy- bottomed saucepan or skillet, heat the butter until the foam 
subsides (unless you’re using clarified butter, then simply heat). Slowly add the 
flour, constantly whisking to form a smooth roux.
3. Add the heated milk to the skillet while whisking (to avoid clumping). 
Continue stirring until the sauce thickens and begins to lightly bubble.
4. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and remove from the heat.
Hollandaise  // MAKES 1 CUP
1 stick (8 ounces) unsalted butter
Juice of ½ lemon
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar4 egg yolks, room temperature
1 tablespoon cold water
1. Clarify the butter by heating in a small skillet over low heat. Skim the white 
residue off as it arrives at a simmer until the butter is golden and clear, about 
5 minutes. Set aside.
2. Bring a medium pot of water to a low simmer, and place a stainless steel 
bowl over it. Add the lemon juice and apple cider vinegar to the bowl, then add 
the egg yolks while whisking constantly.
3. Continuing to whisk, gradually add the warm butter until the mixture 
becomes thick. If the eggs begin to scramble, add cold water and mix. Strain 
out any thick lumps. Serve immediately.XIV | INTROd UCTIONSimple Tomato Sauce  // MAKES ABOUT 2½ CUPS
½ cup extra- virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 (28-  ounce can) San Marzano 
tomatoes
½ teaspoon crushed red pepper 
flakes (or up to 1 tablespoon to 
maximize heat)½ cup roughly chopped fresh 
oregano leaves
Sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1. In a large saucepan over medium heat, heat the olive oil for 1 minute. 
Add the tomato paste, and let it heat for 1 to 2 minutes.
2. Add the tomatoes, stir, and cook. Sprinkle the red pepper and 
oregano on top.
3. Let simmer on medium-  low heat for half an hour to 2 hours, until the sauce is 
thick and soupy. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Use right away, or let cool and freeze in smaller containers for later use.
Basic Mayonnaise  // MAKES ABOUT 1 CUP
½ cup extra- virgin olive oil
½ cup avocado oil (or your oil of 
choice for flavor)
2 large egg yolks
2 teaspoons hot water
1 teaspoon white wine vinegar1 teaspoon Dijon or yellow mustard
Salt
Ground white pepper
1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon 
juice (optional)
1. In a medium bowl, combine the oils.
2. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the yolks, water, vinegar, and 
mustard until foamy. You can do this in a bowl by hand, or in a blender or 
food processor.XV INTROd UCTION |3. Add the oil gradually to the egg yolks, while hand-  whisking or with the 
motor running. Begin with drops, whisking or blending simultaneously, and 
then add more drops as each is incorporated. Then advance to a thin stream, 
until all the oil is mixed in and the mayo is smooth.
4. Season with salt and pepper and, if using, lemon juice. Serve cold.
Stock  // MAKES ABOUT 3 TO 4 CUPS
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon chopped carrot
1 tablespoon chopped onion
1 tablespoon chopped celery
1 pound chicken bones, veal bones, 
nonstarchy vegetables, nonoily fish 
bones and/or heads or shellfish 
remains (shrimp, crawfish, crab, 
lobster)1 quart cold water
1 fresh thyme sprig
1 dried bay leaf
1 small handful juniper berries
1 or 2 fresh sage leaves and stems
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the carrot, onion, and 
celery (known collectively as mirepoix), and cook for 1 minute.
2. Add bones or veggies, and cook until browned—  the time will vary depend -
ing on what you’re using.
3. Transfer everything to a stockpot, and add the water, thyme, bay leaf, juniper 
berries, and sage. Season with salt and pepper, and bring to a simmer over 
medium-  high heat.

 VEGETABLES:  30 minutes to 1 hour
 FISH AND SHELLFISH:  45 minutes to 1 hour
 CHICKEN BONES:  3 to 6 hours, adding liquid as necessary
 VEAL BONES:  4 to 8 hours or all day
5. Strain through a fine mesh strainer and use, or let cool and freeze for 
later use.XVI
 | INTROd UCTIONHow to Use This Book
This book is broken down into four world regions and features 15 sauces from 
each. The land masses each section covers are vast, but the recipes are specific. 
I’ve endeavored to dance between representation and familiarity. So instead of 
pico de gallo and salsa, I went to a native Chilean for Pebre (page 64), which 
combines elements of both.
Part One is structured by region, for you home cooks looking to get out -
side your comfort zone and push your boundaries. I’ve incorporated tips and 
suggestions to ensure you will not be overwhelmed on the journey. Once you 
understand the basics of each sauce, I’d suggest cooking the way I learned 
from my mother— by experimenting.
Each recipe comes with a useful chile icon, for both those who love heat and 
those who don’t (for y’all, just cut back on or leave out the chiles). I’ll include 
some flavor notes, as well, so if you’re unfamiliar with the ingredients, you’ll 
have some sense of where you’ll end up. Under Pairings and Serving Ideas, I’ve 
suggested several mains and sides for each sauce.
Different regions define sauce differently. Some, like Thailand’s Nam Jim 
(page 26), are used for dipping. Some are condiments, used to pour over a 
finished product, such as Tomatillo Salsa Verde (page 58). Others serve as a 
base for soups and stews, a marinade for proteins, or a classic sauce to cook in, 
like Coconut Curry (page 8). Where possible, I’ve indicated in the recipe how 
the sauce is typically used— or suggested various ways it can be used, such 
as pour over, cook in, condiment, marinade, and glaze, as is the case for Chef 
Seong’s hypnotizing Gochujang "Seong" Sauce (page 20). This is what I mean 
by those labels:
 BASE:  use for more complex soups, sauces, and dishes
 CONDIMENT:  acts as an accompaniment, often cold, to a food to 
boost flavor
 COOK IN:  intended for a protein, grain, or base to be cooked in the sauce
 DIPPING:  a sauce put in a bowl or dish for a food to be dipped in
 GLAZE:  used to coat and/or baste a protein as it cooks
 MARINADE:  applied to a base ingredient before cooking to infuse flavor
 MIX IN:  combined with another sauce as a flavoring agentXVII INTROd UCTION |
 POUR OVER:  a sauce, often hot, that is simply poured over a main 
dish or side
 SPREAD:  a thicker sauce applied to bread or sandwiches
One of the main lessons I learned from speaking with readers about what 
they loved in Cooking with Spices  was that sometimes you just have some 
“freakin’ chicken” in the fridge and you don’t know what to do with it. So in 
addition to the 60 sauce recipes, Part Two has more than 30 undemanding 
recipes for proteins, grains, vegetables, beans, and other legumes. You can 
mix and match a sauce and a base for a choose-  your- own- journey approach 
to dinner.
Each recipe in Part Two has sauce pairing suggestions and recommenda -
tions on how and when to use them. The World Pantry (page 189) describes 
some of the less common ingredients you may not necessarily find on your 
local supermarket shelves. You’ll see items like pomegranate molasses, palm 
sugar, fish sauce, and potato flour, for example.
It is my sincere hope that you haven’t come across anything like this book, 
that you’ll use it often, and that it inspires you to go further, to discover. 
Perhaps, after trying sauces from Zach Johnston and inspired by Brian Yazzie, 
that you’ll lead your own investigation into indigenous chefs and foods. A 
good place to continue the journey is following Brian’s work with The Sioux 
Chef, Sean Sherman.
Most of all, when you use the recipes in this book, may it remind you that 
through food, the good out there in the world is allowed to breathe. Perhaps it 
is during a big family meal that the political divide is melted, as happens with 
TJ’s Toum (page 94). Or maybe you’ve been traveling in a foreign country 
and were helped without expectation, as I was in Spain when Manuel and his 
classmates rescued me from a depressive state and swept me to the houses of 
their parents in Portugal where I learned for the first time of Piri Piri Whiskey 
Sauce (page 118). People are still inviting strangers into their kitchens—  the 
safe harbor to the rickety skiffs that are our traveling souls. The recipes in this 
book were given with love. And it is with love that I share them with you. POMEGRANATE-BEET RAITA, PAGE 6  1

1EXPLORING THE 
WORLD OF SAUCES
Cooks throughout the world use sauces to flavor and 
enrich their foods. This is an immense category that 
stretches to include curries, chutneys, marinades, 
gravies, condiments, and dipping sauces. In this part, 
I will introduce you to the world of flavors and ingredients that 
make up each of the cuisines spanned in these four chapters.
Sauces differ by region, but there are many threads that 
connect us. Zhoug (page 96) from Y emen and Chimichurri 
(page 66) from Argentina are cousins, separated— as many 
cousins are—  only by spice content and cilantro preferences. 
Certain flavors might be familiar, but some will likely be distinctly  
foreign. However, I’d like to think that maybe it’s akin to you 
having a flathead screwdriver (hot sauce), and here you’ll find  
a Phillips- head (Sambel Ulek, page 30).
Each chapter acts as a culinary passport to explore a 
condensed area of a vast world region. Asia, the Indian 
Subcontinent, and Oceania, for example, is a considerable 
portion of the Earth. It was not easy to pick 15 distinct sauces 
that stretch from India and Pakistan to New Zealand. Rather 
than comprehensiveness, it is usefulness that resolves the 
balance. Part One is about being excited about learning world 
sauces and how to use them every day.onePART1
ASIA, INDIAN 
SUBCONTINENT, 
AND OCEANIANARROWING DOWN ASIA, OCEANIA, AND THE 
Indian subcontinent into 15 diverse and useful sauce 
recipes was perhaps my most arduous task in compiling 
this book; such is the diversity and creativity of the  
cuisines. To begin with, in many of the cultures 
highlighted in this section, “sauce” has a loose definition. Sauces are 
thought of for dipping or pouring or highlighting or using as a base. One 
Sri Lankan mother communicated to me (through her daughter) that Sri 
Lankans don’t use sauces, while extolling the virtues of Mango Chutney 
(page 12) and Coconut Curry (page 8).
Chiles (a spice that actually comes from the Americas) are the main 
star of this region, with notable exceptions in the recipes from Japan and 
New Zealand. My goal in this chapter is to give you a sauce that acts as 
a “launching pad” into each cuisine and a different tool to put in your 
culinary toolbox.
I’ve reached out to sources more authoritative than my own to present 
sauces people are actually making out there in the world. But authority 
is not always associated with authenticity. Conventional cookbook 
wisdom would advise against including Tikka Masala (page 10), a dish 
considered inauthentic but nevertheless eaten and enjoyed in Indian and 
Bangladeshi restaurants within and outside of the Indian subcontinent. 
Ingredients move and fuse, even if at times the circumstances driving 
them are unpalatable. Tikka Masala in India has been imported to 
accommodate Western palates. Still, the standards for this book are 
deliciousness and versatility, and those benchmarks are what justify its 
inclusion here.
Traditions evolve. New Zealand and Australia are perfect examples 
of this: One must nod to the strong gastronomic cultures that existed 
before European settlement nearly eviscerated them. Other countries 
have sauces that seem to have been part of the culinary culture for as 
long as there has been cuisine. I’ve long dreamed, while staring at the 
Sambel Ulek jar in my fridge, of making it. My visit to Japan— really an 
excuse to binge on ramen—  was rich in sauces, including Ponzu (page 16) 
and Tonkatsu (page 18). Perhaps Cambodian cuisine is not as well known 
(in the West) as its neighbors, but if you’ve spent time in Cambodia, 
you’ll know that any fresh amok  (made with Yellow Kroeung [page 24]) 
rivals any dish you’ve ever had.

POUR OVEROrigin accounts of Tikka Masala differ: a way to 
moisten dry murgh (chicken) tikka in Scotland’s 
Indian restaurants, or the product of innovation 
by Bangladeshi chefs in London. Some Indian and 
Bangladeshi cookbooks do not include it, citing 
inauthenticity. They are correct in that regard. However, 
rightly or wrongly, people around the world eat this 
sauce. Shifting international foodways are avenues for 
adaptability, and there’s no doubt that this is a popular, 
resourceful sauce. My take is a basic skeleton to get you 
started, allowing further improvisation. We use chicken 
here, but try it with your protein of choice, including lamb, 
white fish, or firm tofu for a vegetarian option.
3 tablespoons clarified butter 
or ghee, divided
2 shallots, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 (1- inch) piece fresh 
ginger, minced
1 tablespoon garam masala
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/3 cup heavy (whipping) cream1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 cup Greek yogurt
2 teaspoons freshly squeezed 
lemon juice
1 teaspoon ground 
cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons sea salt
1¼ pounds boneless, skinless 
chicken thighs, cubed, or 
protein of choice
1. In a large, heavy skillet over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons of 
clarified butter. Add the shallots and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until 
they start to sweat. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for a few 
minutes more, until all turn golden brown. Add the garam masala 
and turmeric, and stir for 1 minute to coat everything.11

 ASIA , INdIAN S UBCONTINENT , AN d O CEANIA |1. In a large, non- reactive container, combine the mangos, chiles, 
sugar, ginger, garlic, lime leaves, and figs (if using), and let sit for 
several hours or overnight, covered, in the refrigerator.
2. In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt the coconut oil. 
Transfer the mango mixture to the pan. When warm, add  
¾ cup of vinegar and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes, 
stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the mangoes 
become soft.
3. Turn the heat to low, season with salt and pepper, add the 
garam masala and the remaining ¼ cup of vinegar, and simmer for 
5 to 10 minutes more, until the mixture thickens and the liquid has 
cooked away.
4. Let cool before storing.

INGREDIENT TIP:  Kaffir lime leaves will be the most difficult  ingredient 
to track down, but some specialty stores have them. They’re often 
dried, so they also ship well. I get mine from Red Stick Spice Company 
(see  Resources on page 200).MAINS

CONd IMENTBlack Bean Sauce is a flavor you’re no doubt familiar 
with if ever you’ve dined in a Chinese restaurant or 
dabbled in East Asian–inspired cuisine. It’s made from 
fermented soybeans— unlike the black beans used in 
Latin cuisine— which are known as douchi.  This sauce is 
incredibly easy to make at home and store for future use. 
Stir- fry is simply incomplete without it. Or put a smear 
in or on an omelet, or sauté tofu in Black Bean Sauce 
and garlic.
4 tablespoons fermented black 
beans (see Ingredient tip)
¼ cup peanut oil
1 (1- inch) piece fresh 
ginger, chopped
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoons crushed 
red pepper flakes or 
1 tablespoon chili paste, such 
as Sambel Ulek (page 30)
1 whole star anise pod
1 tablespoon oyster sauce (or 
Bragg Liquid Aminos)2 scallions, green parts 
only, chopped
¼ cup mirin or rice wine
¼ cup chicken or vegetable 
stock (page xv)
½ teaspoon cornstarch 
dissolved in 
1 teaspoon water
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed 
lemon juice
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1. Cover the black beans in cool or room temperature water for 
30 minutes to allow them to reconstitute. Drain and rinse several 
times, pat dry, then chop or mash them.15
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS ASIA , INdIAN S UBCONTINENT , AN d O CEANIA |2. In a medium saucepan over high heat, heat the oil until it lightly 
smokes, add the black beans and ginger, and cook, stirring, for 
1 to 2 minutes.
3. Add the soy sauce, red pepper flakes, star anise, oyster sauce, 
and scallions, stirring constantly, and cook just until fragrant. Add 
the mirin and stock, and mix. Turn the heat to medium-  low and let 
simmer for 10 minutes.
4. Add the cornstarch to thicken the sauce and the lemon juice to 
flavor. Season with salt and pepper.
STORAGE:  2 weeks in the refrigerator, in a glass jar or plastic con -
tainer, or freeze in ice cube trays and transfer to a freezer bag for 
3 to 6 months
INGREDIENT TIP:  Fermented black beans can be found at most Asian 
markets and are easily ordered online.
REPURPOSING TIP:  Shellfish are great cooked right as you make the 
black bean sauce. Simply switch to a wok or braising pan and add 
2 to 3 pounds of mussels, clams, or shrimp (even snails) right before 
you add the mirin and stock in step 3.MAINS

MIX INPonzu is a Japanese staple sometimes described 
as akin to vinaigrette, but I’ve found its uses to be 
much broader. It really is a culinary workhorse, with a 
range from seafood to poultry, but can also be added to 
barbecue sauces, marinades, stir- fries, and dressings. 
Specific ponzu recipes are also closely guarded, so 
I was grateful when my friends Zanzuki and Satomi— 
whom I met while traveling in Japan— lent me theirs.
4 to 5 yellow yuzu, halved (or 
a mix of the juice of lemons 
and limes [4 to 5 total])
¾ cup dark soy sauce
1 teaspoon mirin or rice wine 
(optional)5 grams dried kelp (kombu)
5 grams bonito flakes
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Fine metal strainer
1. Cut the yuzu in half and juice them, being careful not to get any 
seeds. After squeezing once, press the pulp inside using a spoon to 
squeeze out the remaining juice.17
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS ASIA , INdIAN S UBCONTINENT , AN d O CEANIA |2. In a glass container such as a clean bottle, mix the dark soy 
sauce and yuzu juice. Add the mirin (optional) to mellow out 
the flavor. Add the kelp and bonito flakes, mix, and refrigerate 
the container.
3. Marinate for at least 1 to 2 days, or up to 2 weeks. The longer it 
sits, the more delicious it becomes, and the sour taste will increase 
as well.
4. Use the strainer to strain out the kelp and bonito flakes. Transfer 
the sauce to another clean jar to store.
STORAGE:  6 months in the refrigerator, in a glass jar
INGREDIENT TIP:  The base of this sauce is dashi , which is a stock 
made from dried kelp and bonito flakes. Mirin is a sweet Japanese rice 
 cooking wine. You’ll find them all at Japanese supermarkets or online.
REPURPOSING TIP:  Ponzu can be thinned with oil and vinegar as 
a dressing or thickened by cooking down (add a bit of cornstarch to 
enhance the process).MAINS

CONd IMENTTonkatsu is a complex and delicious Japanese 
barbecue sauce that can be used for all types 
of katsu- style cooking (pork or other protein, coated 
and fried in panko breadcrumbs). It’s a Western- style 
sauce— developed after the turn of the twentieth century. 
There are three types of this style of sauce (pronounced 
so- su  in Japanese): usutah  is thin like Worcestershire 
sauce; chuno  is medium thick; and Tonkatsu is the 
thickest.
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
3 tablespoons Worcestershire 
sauce (or Bragg 
Liquid Aminos)
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons mirin or 
rice wine
1 tablespoon soy sauce¼ teaspoon crushed red 
pepper flakes
1 tablespoon oyster or fish 
sauce (see Ingredient tip)
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon cornstarch 
dissolved in 
2 teaspoons water
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Mortar and pestle
1. In a small, dry skillet over medium-  high heat, toast the sesame 
seeds for 1 to 2 minutes, until aromatic. Let cool, and crush in a 
mortar and pestle.19
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS ASIA , INdIAN S UBCONTINENT , AN d O CEANIA |2. In a medium bowl, mix together the crushed seeds, Worcester -
shire, tomato paste, sugar, mustard, mirin, soy sauce, red pepper 
flakes, oyster sauce, and honey. Let sit for 1 to 2 hours.
3. Transfer the mixture to a small saucepan, set over medium 
heat, and cook just until the sugar is dissolved and the honey 
evenly spreads.
4. Add the cornstarch as it starts to simmer, and cook, stirring, 
for 1 or 2 minutes, until the sauce thickens.
STORAGE:  4 to 5 days in a glass jar
INGREDIENT TIP:  Oyster sauce is widely available in supermarkets. 
You’ll find fish sauce at most grocery stores in the international food 
aisle. For a vegan sauce, use Bragg Liquid Aminos instead of the oyster 
or fish sauce and Worcestershire.
REPURPOSING TIP:  Pair Tonkatsu with Japanese mayonnaise— easily 
purchased at an international market— and wasabi. Mix 1 tablespoon 
wasabi powder with 1 tablespoon water and let sit for 10 minutes. Then 
add 4 tablespoons Japanese mayo, 1 teaspoon lemon zest, a dash of 
soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon Shichimi Togarashi (a spice blend that’s 
equal parts sansho peppercorns, crushed red pepper flakes, dried 
orange peel, sesame seeds, ground ginger, shredded nori seaweed, and 
poppy seeds), or any spice blend you prefer.MAINS

BASEGochujang , the base for this sauce, is a Korean chili 
paste made with chile peppers, rice powder, and 
a soybean paste called doenjang . It ferments in clay 
pots for months until it becomes rich and paste- like. Chef 
Seong Hwang, private chef to future NBA Hall of Famers, 
told me that as kids, he and his brother used to mix it 
with ketchup and mayo to use as a dip with snacks. You 
can also use it as a base for other dynamic sauces and 
marinades. A dish called  (bul- dak)— translated as 
“fire chicken”— is a typical dish that uses gochujang, but 
I eat it with a spoon as well.
6 whole garlic cloves, peeled
¼ cup gochujang (Korean chili 
paste; see Ingredient tip)
¼ cup honey
2 tablespoons soy sauce2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 (1- inch piece) fresh 
ginger, grated
1 tablespoon toasted 
sesame oil
1. In a small skillet over medium heat, roast the peeled garlic 
cloves for 1 to 2 minutes, until fragrant, then mince.21
 ASIA , INdIAN S UBCONTINENT , AN d O CEANIA |2. In a small mixing bowl, combine the garlic, gochujang, honey, 
soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, and sesame oil.
3. Let sit at room temperature for an hour before transferring 
to a jar.
STORAGE:  1 month in the refrigerator, in a glass jar
INGREDIENT TIP:  You can find gochujang in many stores, including 
Whole Foods. Annie Chun’s is a well- known brand.
REPURPOSING TIP:  You can adjust the thickness using more or less of 
the vinegar and sesame oil and tinker with the sweetness by adding a 
little corn syrup. Combine this sauce with mayonnaise for a spread or 
dipping sauce for seafood, sushi, or shellfish.MAINS

dIPPINGNuoc mam  is the quintessential sauce of Vietnam, 
according to Chef Nini Nguyen, who graces Season 
16 of Top Chef.  Her inside joke is that nuoc mam is 
to Vietnam as ketchup is to Americans: It goes on 
everything. There are regional differences. “In the north, 
they use vinegar for the acid, and in the south, they use 
coconut water for sweetness,” said Chef Nini. She also 
said you can substitute ginger for the garlic, especially 
when using this sauce with fish.

1 to 3 bird’s eye chiles, fresh 
or frozen
¼ cup sugar
¼ cup fish sauce¼ cup freshly squeezed 
lime juice
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED

chef’s knife)
1. In the mortar and pestle, crush the garlic and chiles until they 
form a paste. Or crush the ingredients with the side of a chef’s 
knife. You can add some of the sugar to help you achieve the 
paste consistency.23

3. Add the fish sauce and lime juice, and stir until the sugar

dIPPINGI was immediately smitten during my time in Cambodia 
with fish amok,  a popular Khmer dish featuring kaffir 
lime leaves and lemongrass that uses kroeung  paste as 
a base. Kroeung paste is a Cambodian staple. It comes 
in three colors— yellow, green, and red. The yellow comes 
from turmeric, the green from lemongrass and cilantro, 
and the red from chiles. I asked my friend Lin, who is 
from Siem Reap, for advice on this recipe. She mentioned 
that condensed milk is often favored to palm sugar as 
a variation on this delicious curry.
2 dried chiles
2 fresh lemongrass stalks 
(cores only), sliced 
into rounds
1 teaspoon fish sauce
6 garlic cloves, crushed
10 kaffir lime leaves, deveined 
(see Ingredient tip)
2 tablespoons vegetable 
oil, divided
2 shallots, diced
1 (13.5-  ounce) can full- fat 
coconut milk2 whole star anise pods
1 teaspoon ground turmeric or 
1- inch piece fresh, minced
1 teaspoon dried galangal or 
1- inch piece fresh, minced 
(see Ingredient tip)
1 teaspoon granulated 
palm sugar or sweetened 
condensed milk
Salt
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Food processor
1. Let the chiles soak in a small bowl of warm water for 20 minutes 
to reconstitute while you prepare the other ingredients. Drain well, 
then remove the seeds and stems.25
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS ASIA , INdIAN S UBCONTINENT , AN d O CEANIA |2. In the food processor, grind together the lemongrass, fish sauce, 
garlic, lime leaves, chiles, and 1 tablespoon of oil to make the 
kroeung paste.
3. In a medium saucepan over low heat, heat the remaining 
1 tablespoon of oil. Add the shallots and cook until slightly trans -
lucent, 2 minutes or so. Add the kroeung paste and simmer for 
2 to 3 minutes, until it slightly browns.
4. Add the coconut milk, star anise, turmeric, galangal, and sugar, 
and stir. Let simmer for 10 minutes, or until the coconut milk is 
smooth. Season with salt.
STORAGE:  4 to 5 days in the refrigerator, in a glass jar or plastic 
container
INGREDIENT TIP:  Galangal is a cousin of ginger and can be ordered 
dried on the Internet. Though not ideal, you can substitute lime zest 
and a squeeze of lemon juice for kaffir lime leaves.
REPURPOSING TIP:  There is a lot of room to play with taste and color. 
Add more basic chili paste and leave out the turmeric for more of a red 
kroeung. Cook your protein of choice in the sauce by adding it at the 
end of step 3, and simmer until cooked through.MAINS

BASEThai cuisine is full of rich sauces and condiments. 
Nam Jim  means “dipping sauce” in Thai, and there 
are many kinds. This sauce is a sweeter chili sauce that 
is commonplace on Thai and Laotian tables. It also 
serves as the base for other Thai dipping sauces, made 
by adding more ingredients. Alyssa Han, owner of Food 
and Arts by Alyssa — an eco- friendly Thai cooking retreat 
outside Bangkok— graciously provided this recipe that 
works with Thai appetizers as well as steamed and 
grilled meats. To make the sauce vegan, use soy sauce or 
Bragg Liquid Aminos instead of fish sauce.
FOR THE TAMARIND SAUCE

7 tablespoons seedless 
tamarind pulp
¼ cup fish sauce¼ cup granulated palm sugar
2 tablespoons white vinegar
2 tablespoons superfine or

1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon chopped shallot
1 tablespoon chopped

PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS ASIA , INdIAN S UBCONTINENT , AN d O CEANIA |TO MAKE THE TAMARIND SAUCE
1. In a small saucepan, boil the water. Take the pan off the heat, 
and add the tamarind pulp. Remove from the heat, let sit for 
30 minutes, and stir until mixed. Squeeze through a sieve to 
remove any pulp or plant mass. You should end up with just over  
¾ cups liquid concentrate. Add a bit more water if necessary.
2. Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add your tamarind 
concentrate, and bring to a boil. Add the fish sauce and then the 
palm sugar.
3. When everything is dissolved, add the vinegar and caster sugar. 
Turn the heat to low and cook for 5 minutes, until the tamarind 
sauce is thick and syrupy. Set aside.
TO MAKE THE NAM JIM
1. In the food processor, blend the chiles, garlic, shallot, coriander 
root, onion, and 3 tablespoons of your tamarind sauce until you 
have a paste.
2. In a small skillet over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the paste, 
and bring to a simmering boil. Stir to combine.
3. Lower the heat. Add the remainder of the tamarind sauce, and 
season with salt. Remove from the heat and let cool.
STORAGE:  2 to 3 weeks in the refrigerator, in a glass jar or plastic 
container
INGREDIENT TIP:  Asian or Indian specialty markets will likely 
have cilantro with the roots still attached. Another trick is to ask a 
 neighborhood Thai restaurant if you can buy some of theirs during 
their next order.MAINS

POUR OVERThe satay expertise here belongs to Tanny 
Jiraprapasuke, whose mother, Kanya, owned and 
operated a Thai restaurant in the 1980s when Thai 
food was starting to emerge in their adopted home of 
Glendale, California. Tanny told me many dishes had to 
be altered for the American palate, but satay (and pad 
Thai) were not among them. She said, “Even though satay 
is street food in Thailand, we always felt that there is 
something celebratory about the sauce. We only had it 
when there was a birthday or a big party.”
1¼ cups water
7 tablespoons seedless 
tamarind pulp
½ cup raw peanuts
1 tablespoon extra- virgin olive 
oil or peanut oil
1 to 2 tablespoons Thai 
red curry paste (see 
Ingredient tip)
4 tablespoons massaman curry 
paste (see Ingredient tip)4.5 ounces full- fat coconut milk
1 to 2 tablespoons liquid 
coconut sugar
Pinch salt
½ teaspoon fish sauce
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Mortar and pestle
1. In a small saucepan, boil the water. Take the pan off the heat, and 
add the tamarind pulp, stir until mixed, remove from the heat, and 
let sit for 30 minutes. Squeeze through a sieve to remove any pulp 
or plant mass. Save what you don’t use for future use (like in Nam 
Jim, page 26).29
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS ASIA , INdIAN S UBCONTINENT , AN d O CEANIA |2. In a dry, medium pan over low heat, roast the peanuts until 
slightly charred (not burned), about 10 minutes. Place in the 
mortar with the oil, and work the peanuts into a chunky paste. 
This takes a little while but is worth the effort.
3. In a nonstick medium pot over medium heat, slightly sauté the 
red curry and massaman curry pastes, continuously stirring with 
a wooden spoon, for about 1 minute.
4. Slowly add some of the coconut milk into the pot, and continue 
to stir until the liquid evaporates. Then add a little more coconut 
milk and continue to stir the mixture for 3 to 4 minutes more.
5. Add the rest of the coconut milk and the peanut paste, coconut 
sugar, and 2 to 3 tablespoons of the liquid tamarind pulp. Continue 
to stir and allow the sauce to bubble and thicken. Add a pinch of 
salt, stir, then add the fish sauce to taste. Let cool.
STORAGE:  1 week in the refrigerator, in a glass jar
INGREDIENT TIP:  You can find both massaman and red curry paste in 
Asian grocery stores or online in small jars or cans.
REPURPOSING TIP:  The char on the peanuts adds a smokier flavor. 
You can freshen up leftover sauce by adding some coconut milk or even 
half and half and heating it on low on the stovetop. Then, right before 
serving, add ½ teaspoon of red chili oil. This will brighten the color and 
add a silkier texture.MAINS

COOK INSambel Ulek  is an extremely popular Indonesian 
chili sauce traditionally ground using a special 
mortar and pestle called a cobek  and ulekan — hence the 
name. Perhaps you’ve seen the bottle at the store in the 
hot sauce aisle, labeled Sambal Oelek (a timeworn way 
the Dutch spelled it, apparently). One of the reasons to 
make your own Sambel Ulek (besides homemade always 
beating store bought) rather than using, say, sriracha, is 
there’s very little sugar. Plus you can then cook sambel 
goring , chili stir- fry. Jeanie Laksmi of Bandung on West 
Java imparted her wisdom for this recipe.
15 or 16 mini sweet red peppers 
or fresh big red chiles (such 
as merah besar, cayenne, 
serrano, or fireflame), 
seeded and stemmed 
(see Repurposing tip)
40 to 45 fresh green or red 
rawit or bird’s eye chiles, 
seeded and stemmed (see 
Repurposing tip)
1 large or 2 small shallots, diced
1 tablespoon terasi shrimp 
paste (optional, omit for 
Vegan; see Ingredient tip)1 tablespoon tomato paste
2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon coconut oil
1 teaspoon granulated 
palm sugar

PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS ASIA , INdIAN S UBCONTINENT , AN d O CEANIA |1. In a large pan over medium heat, fry the chiles, shallots, shrimp 
paste (if using), tomato paste, salt, coconut oil, and palm sugar 
until the chiles are cooked through, about 10 minutes. Open a 
window if using terasi shrimp paste, because it will stink to high 
heaven at first.
2. Let cool, then grind or process into a paste.
STORAGE:  3 to 4 weeks in the refrigerator, in a glass jar or plastic 
container
INGREDIENT TIP:  Terasi shrimp makes this more authentically Indo -
nesian. It is not the same thing as shrimp paste in bean oil, commonly 
found in the international aisle in the supermarket. Order online if you 
can’t find it at an international market.
REPURPOSING TIP:  Fresh green and sweet red peppers are mild  
alternatives to ease the heat for non- chileheads. To further decrease 
the heat, use green bird’s eye chiles instead of red. To increase the  
heat, leave the seeds in. The sauce will become less hot as it sits in  
the refrigerator.MAINS

BASEAdobo is a national dish in the Philippines, though 
it’s exceptionally regionally specific. Kim Suarez, 
senior editor of this book, graciously allowed me to share 
her mother’s hyper- regional Adobo recipe, with the caveat 
that I include bay leaf, Kim’s addition. Her mom puts 
black pepper in hers as a connection to Bicol, which is 
where Kim’s grandfather is from. Bicol is comprised of 
islands in and around the southern end of Luzon Island. 
The cooking tends to use peppers and more heat and 
spice. As a nod to Kim’s aunt, who puts achiote oil in 
her chicken Adobo, I’ve incorporated it here for a burst 
of color.
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 to 4 garlic cloves, minced
1 pound medium to large 
shrimp, heads removed, 
shelled and deveined, or your 
protein of choice
¼ cup white vinegar (optional)
¼ teaspoon freshly ground 
black pepper
1 dried bay leaf1 (13.5-  ounce) can full- fat 
coconut milk, or 1 cup fresh 
(may be reduced to desired 
consistency)
Fish sauce or salt, for seasoning
1 small jalapeño pepper, 
halved lengthwise, seeded, 
and sliced
1 tablespoon achiote oil (see 
Ingredient tip)
2 scallions, green parts only, 
chopped, for garnish
1. In a large pan over medium heat, heat the oil. Sauté the garlic 
until golden brown and aromatic, about 2 minutes.33
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS ASIA , INdIAN S UBCONTINENT , AN d O CEANIA |2. Add the shrimp, followed by the vinegar (if using), without 
stirring. When the liquid stars to boil, sprinkle in the pepper and 
add the bay leaf.
3. Pour in the coconut milk. Cook for about 2 minutes, until it 
boils. Season with fish sauce.
4. Add the sliced jalapeño and achiote oil, and cook for another 
3 to 4 minutes. Take care to not overcook the shrimp or they will 
become rubbery and tough. They should be light and flavorful.
5. Remove from the heat, and serve garnished with the scallions.
STORAGE:  2 weeks in the refrigerator, in a glass jar or plastic container
INGREDIENT TIP:  Make achiote oil by frying 1 tablespoon annatto 
seeds in ½ cup peanut oil for about 3 or 4 minutes. Strain out the seeds.

COOK INNew Zealand has a mix of colonist (specifically 
British) cuisine, native ingredients long used by 
indigenous peoples such as the Māori, and imported 
flavors from neighboring Southeast Asian countries.  
A traditional Māori hungi — in which a plethora of food 
is cooked underground using hot stones— is perhaps 
the most iconic gastronomic offering of the island. 
Alternatively, a versatile sauce descended from the 
European heritage of New Zealand is this superb cream 
sauce developed by Jack Hatzfeld, who was inspired by 
a version of this sauce while on a photography journey 
around the stunning South Island.
7 teaspoons butter, divided
1 shallot, diced
1 stalk fresh lemongrass, cut in 
1- inch slices (optional; see 
Ingredient tip)
2 garlic cloves, whole
1 teaspoon white pepper
1¼ cups New Zealand 
Sauvignon Blanc1½ teaspoons chopped fresh 
tarragon
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed 
lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
¾ cup heavy (whipping) cream
Salt
1. In a medium saucepan over medium-  low heat, heat 1 teaspoon 
of butter. Add the shallots and lemongrass (if using), and cook for 
2 to 3 minutes.35

2. Add the garlic, white pepper, wine, tarragon, and lemon juice 
and zest. Bring to a simmer over medium-  high heat, and cook for 
6 minutes.
3. Remove the strips of lemongrass and garlic cloves, and 
add the remaining 6 teaspoons of butter. Cook until it melts. 
Add the cream.
4. Turn the heat to low and let simmer for 10 minutes. Season 
with salt.
STORAGE:  1 week in the refrigerator, in a glass jar or plastic container
INGREDIENT TIP:  To cut lemongrass, you must chop off the top and 
bottom and bisect the stalk to remove the tough outer layers, revealing 
the tender inside.MAINS

AMERICASIF YOU HANG OUT LONG ENOUGH IN A BAR IN BUENOS 
Aires—  where the Chimichurri recipe in this chapter originates 
(page 66)—  you’ll eventually hear an Argentine complain about 
the proprietorship of the word “American” by citizens of the 
United States. They’re not wrong. As South Americans, they’re 
Americans, too.
Before the establishment of modern borders, the Americas were 
just one connected land mass. And there was a time when this land was 
likely more united under a spirit of collectivity than it is today. Look to 
3,000-  year- old stores of quinoa found in Ontario, Canada, as proof of the 
previously undescribed trade networks—  long known to Native peoples— 
that existed in this part of the world.
It is in this character that the recipes in this chapter lead from one to 
another. The food found here is cooked in homes every day and paired 
with all manner of ingredients, which is what versatile cooking is all 
about. After all, this region is responsible for pumpkins, tomatoes, corn, 
potatoes, chile peppers, avocados, chocolate, and spices like annatto, 
pepitas, vanilla, and allspice.
The Americas is where adaptable sauces blossom, though this is partly 
due to the involuntary colonial influence on the region. We sometimes 
hear words like “unsophisticated” to describe the cuisine of the Americas, 
but this region has a diverse culinary backbone that is on full display in 
its regional sauces.
Oftentimes, “American” foods are thought of as either Latin dishes or 
watered- down derivations of European cuisine. However, long before the 
Europeans came, the foodways of the Americas were whole and diverse. 
Along with simplified versions of classics like Mexican Mole (page 56) 
and Cuban Mojito (page 52), you’ll also notice a disproportionate number 
of sauces from the United States. I am proud to highlight indigenous 
chefs and ingredients, beginning in this section with a sauce from 
Zach Johnston featuring a purely American ingredient—  huckleberry 
(page 40)— and one inspired by discussions with Navajo chef Brian 
Yazzie, featuring squash (page 50).

COOK IN“Huckleberries were the sweet cornerstone of Salish 
cooking for the indigenous communities of the 
Pacific Northwest,” Zach Johnston, of the Skokomish 
tribe of Washington, told me while teaching me about 
this huckleberry sauce that he makes after foraging. 
Huckleberries’ sweetness will vary depending on the time 
of year they are harvested. Early in the season, they are 
grassy and tart; later, they are sweet and earthy. Both 
flavor profiles work well on all types of wild fish, gamey or 
farmed meats, and steak.
1 cup fresh huckleberries, 
stemmed and thoroughly 
washed (see Ingredient tip)
½ cup chopped fresh 
ramps (wild garlic; see 
Ingredient tip)
½ cup extra- virgin olive oilSalt
Freshly ground black pepper
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Blender or food processor
1. In a food processor or blender, combine the berries, ramps, and 
oil and blend into a paste. Add salt a pinch at a time until you taste 
the full profile of the berries. Sprinkle on pepper to taste.41
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS AMERICAS |2. Use this sauce on filets of salmon, halibut, trout, steak, or duck 
by smothering the entire top side of the protein with a thick layer 
of sauce, until the flesh is no longer visible.
3. Place the protein on a wood slab on a high-  heat fire or grill.
4. The sauce should bubble just as the protein reaches ideal 
 internal temperature (130° to 150°F for fish). Add more sauce as a 
baste if the protein needs more time to cook.
STORAGE:  1 week in the refrigerator, in a glass jar
INGREDIENT TIP:  Fresh huckleberries are very easily found online and 
are often shipped overnight. You can substitute blueberries, or any 
forest fruit, for the huckleberries, but know that cultivated berries are 
generally sweeter than necessary for this kind of sauce. So look for 
tart ones that don’t over- sweeten the dish. Frozen ones are fine in this 
recipe; let them thaw to room temperature before using.
INGREDIENT TIP:  If you can’t find ramps, you can use the green part of 
spring onions, scallions, or a leek.MAINS

MARINAd EI asked my friend Matt Moore, author of The South’s 
Best Butts,  to contribute a good starter barbecue 
sauce. He told me that throughout North Carolina, 
“one would be taken out back if the likes of sugar and 
tomato made their way into any said sauce. But being 
the Georgia boy that I am, now by way of Tennessee, the 
barbecue trail becomes more and more muddled as you 
make your way westward. Though I’m a vinegar purist, 
I’ve found that a touch of tomato and sugar, along with 
a few other catch- all ingredients, can sure round up as 
many palates as possible— making believers out of most. 
This is my go- to sauce for pork, chicken, and sausages. 
Just keep it away from beef, as you should never put 
vinegar on smoked beef. Skipping the allspice is a sin; it’s 
the spice that makes this sauce feel like a family secret.”

fake foods that developed out of TV dinners and 
ready- made dishes of the 1980s. It’s like an additive- free 
Velveeta that can go on true Midwestern, Americanized 
staples like nachos, macaroni, and burgers. It was

acid, and is found naturally in tomatoes, grapes, cheese, mushrooms, 
and other foods. It can truly heighten the flavors of a dish.

CONd IMENTCreole Remoulade is based on the French sauce 
remoulade, made with mayonnaise or aioli 
(mayo seasoned with garlic). The Louisiana variety, 
though, is reddish and spicy. As a resident of New 
Orleans, I enjoy this recipe from Louisiana native Chris 
LeBlanc and his family. We drive down to Plaquemines 
Parish in winter to pick the citrus. The grapefruits are 
colossal, and the ones in Buras, Louisiana, are like 
flavor bombs ready to explode. Comeback Sauce is the 
kissin’ cousin to Creole Remoulade. Martha Hall Foose—
2009 James Beard award winner for Best American

coming back for it time and time again.

MIX INGreen chile dances on the taste buds of most visitors 
to the Land of Enchantment; such is the unbridled 
flavor of New Mexico’s Hatch and Lemitar varieties of 
green chile peppers. They can be ordered online, but 
in a pinch, you can use a mix of Anaheim chiles and/
or (gulp!) jalapeños. Though this is a seasonal recipe— 
dependent on when you can get the capsicums—I consider 
a green chile–doused burrito at Albuquerque restaurant 
Frontier a strong candidate for my response when asked 
my choice for a last meal. So it’s worth the wait. This is a 
dish in itself but can also be poured generously on tacos, 
arepas, or beans and rice. It comes from the Chacon 
family, whose matriarch freezes it and sends it to her 
daughters across the country.
7 or 8 New Mexico green chiles
1 tablespoon extra- virgin 
olive oil
2 cups cubed boneless pork, 
or protein of choice
1 medium onion, diced

2 teaspoons onion powder
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons salt49
 AMERICAS |PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Spread the chiles on a baking sheet, and roast for 10 minutes. Or 
roast over a low flame on a grill for 15 to 20 minutes, flipping occa -
sionally, until the skin is blackened. Place in a sealed container for 
30 minutes while they cool. Then peel and dice.
3. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the pork in the olive 
oil until browned, about 7 minutes. Add the onion and garlic, and 
cook until the onions are translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the 
chiles and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring often. Add the flour 
and cook, stirring constantly, to brown (but not burn!).
4. When the flour is browned and the protein is evenly coated, add 
the water, bring to a boil, and stir in the onion and garlic powders 
and salt. Cover and simmer on low for about 2 hours.

Diné chef Brian Yazzie, combines several American 
ingredients that pair with almost any base, such is their 
resourcefulness. Squash, allspice, and chiles are all 
native to the Americas. Brian’s work in the decolonization 
of food movement celebrates Native ingredients and 
informs us on how we can build more sustainable eating 
practices. If local components are the next natural 
progression of food preparation, recipes like this are good 
ones to know.

COOK INCuban cuisine has been close to my heart ever since 
my college roommate invited me to her home in 
Miami and introduced me to her mom’s wonderful 
Cuban food. It’s fair to note that there is a difference 
between plates on the resource- deprived island after a 
devastating embargo and those of the Cuban diaspora 
in south Florida. However, what both share is the soul of 
food that is created to be shared and enjoyed with family. 
The Vadia clan, which was my surrogate family for two 
years, is the inspiration for this mojo recipe. If you’re 
using this as a marinade for fish, don’t let it sit too long; 
1 to 2 hours is appropriate.
3 garlic cloves, unpeeled
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons light oil (olive, 
grapeseed, vegetable, or 
avocado)
1 shallot, finely minced1 green chile pepper 
(jalapeño or small Anaheim), 
finely minced
¾ cup sour orange juice 
(see Ingredient tip)
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Mortar and pestle
1. In a small skillet over medium heat, dry roast the garlic cloves in 
their husks for 3 to 5 minutes. Let cool, peel, and finely mince them.53

and pepper.
3. In a large bowl, combine the garlic with the oil, shallot, chile 
pepper, and orange juice. Whisk until the sauce comes together.
STORAGE:  5 days in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic container,

POUR OVER
COOK INThe balance of tangy sweet and spicy heat makes 
jerk tick. I love it as a paste and marinade, too, but 
it is easily converted to a sauce. I offered my neighbor in 
New Orleans some jerk chicken from the recipe in Spices,  
and she politely declined given the heat, giving it out to 
family instead. Later, she returned the container and told 
me it was delicious. When I asked her about it, she said 
matter- of- factly, “That wasn’t hot at all, baby.” That I had 
put three habaneros in there didn’t seem to move the 
needle for Mrs. Frances, so notch up the heat by throwing in 
a couple extra chiles if you have a higher tolerance. Here’s 
how to turn jerk into a versatile barbecue sauce. Leave out 
the stock or water if you want it more like a paste.
6 teaspoons coconut 
oil, divided
1 shallot, chopped
2 scallions, green parts 
only, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
3 Scotch bonnet or habanero 
chiles, stemmed and seeded 
(see Ingredient tip)
¼ cup tomato paste
½ cup chicken or vegetable 
stock (page xv), or water2 teaspoons ground allspice
½ cup fresh pineapple chunks
2 tablespoons soy sauce
¼ cup apple cider vinegar
¼ cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons honey
Juice and zest of 1 lime
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Food processor55
 AMERICAS |PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS
1. In a medium skillet over medium heat, heat 2 teaspoons of oil. 
When hot, add the shallot, scallions, garlic, and chiles, and sauté 
until golden, 4 to 5 minutes.
2. Add the tomato paste and stock. Mix and cook until everything 
comes together, about 5 minutes.
3. Mix in the allspice, pineapple, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and salt. 
Stir. Then turn off the heat and let cool for 10 minutes.
4. Transfer to a food processor, and pulse until combined and a 
paste is formed.
5. Return the mixture to the skillet. Add the honey and lime juice 
and zest. Cook over low heat, reducing, for 15 minutes.
6. To use as a cook- in sauce, use half the sauce to cook 4 to 
6 pieces of your chosen base, and save the rest to pour over when 
it’s done cooking.
STORAGE:  1 to 2 weeks in the refrigerator, in a glass jar or plastic 
container
INGREDIENT TIP:  The heat in this recipe is entirely under your control. 
Remove the seeds and use fewer chiles to reduce the heat. Keep the 
seeds and add more chiles to induce it. The more often you eat a spice, 
the more tolerant you will become.MAINS

POUR OVERMole melts the heart quicker than it melts the famous 
piece of chocolate one adds at the end. It derives 
from the Aztec Nahuatl word molli — roughly “a sauce made 
with chiles” or “a mixture.” The sauce originates from the 
Mexican states of Puebla and Oaxaca. It has many editions 
of varying complexity, with some involving more than 
20 ingredients. This recipe, from my dear friend Lola Lozano 
Lara’s grandfather, Papa Lara (who is from Veracruz), oozes 
versatility and simplicity (by mole standards). 
3½ ounces dried ancho chiles 
(about 10; see Ingredient tip)
3½ ounces dried mulato chiles 
(about 20; see Ingredient tip)
1¾ ounces dried pasilla chiles 
(about 5; see Ingredient tip)
1 bolillo bread roll, or 6 or 7 
white bread slices, crusts 
removed, torn into pieces
1 corn tortilla, torn into pieces
1/3 cup raisins
2 tablespoons 
crushed almonds
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
6 peppercorns

1 tablespoon vegetable oil
½ medium onion, chopped
½ very ripe plantain, sliced
1 teaspoon salt
1½ ounces Mexican chocolate 
or dark baking chocolate

cacao), divided
2 cups chicken or vegetable

SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Spice grinder or mortar and

Dutch oven, food processor 
or blender57
 AMERICAS |PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS
1. Remove the veins and seeds from all the chiles. In a large braising 
pan over low heat, toast all the chiles for 5 to 8 minutes to release 
their flavors. Add water to the pan so it just covers the chiles.
2. Add the bread, tortilla, raisins, and almonds. Turn the heat down 
very low and let soak for 30 minutes. Drain the excess water into a 
bowl and set aside for adding to the sauce as it cooks down.
3. In a small skillet over low heat, roast the sesame seeds, pepper -
corns, cloves, and cinnamon stick for 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside to 
cool, then grind each separately in a mortar and pestle or together 
in a spice grinder.
4. In your large cast iron pan, heat the oil over medium-  low heat. 
Sauté the onion until golden brown, about 5 minutes.
5. Transfer the drained chili mixture to a food processor or 
blender. Add the onions and the plantain. Process until combined, 
adding a splash of the chili water if necessary.
6. Return everything to the cast iron pan. Over low to medium 
heat, mix in the ground spices, salt, and about half of the chocolate 
along with 1 cup of stock. Let the mole cook down for 30 minutes.
7. Add your protein of choice. Turn the protein every so often until 
cooked through, roughly 30 minutes for chicken. Use the remain -
ing 1 cup of stock and, if needed, some of the chili water to keep it 
moist as the sauce cooks down.
STORAGE:  1 week in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic container 
(although it might stain) or 1 month in the freezer in a plastic freezer

POUR OVERTomatillos are secretly the next culinary thing.  
Shhh— don’t tell anyone. They are an extremely 
versatile nightshade, often called husk tomatoes in the 
United States. Picked early, they’re a perfect base for 
a tart salsa. Harvested late, they’re a hearty tomato 
substitute. Notoriously disease resistant, they may just 
be the crop of the future. I owe my tomatillo inspiration to 
Eddie Hernandez, author of Turnip Greens and Tortillas  
and owner of Taqueria del Sol in Georgia and Tennessee. 
His paired-back use of them unlocked the secret to their 
potential: keep it simple.
3 tablespoons extra- virgin 
olive oil, divided
1 pound (about 16) ripe

and a healthy pinch of salt.
3. In the food processor, combine the pepper mixture with the 
softened tomatillos, and pulse or use the chop setting.

nuts, and season with salt.

dIPPINGGuasacaca — or wasacaca  (a slightly different 
Dominican sauce shares this name)— is Venezuela’s 
avocado- based accompaniment that is less like 
guacamole and more like the love child of guac and 
chimichurri. It’s made with a vinegar base instead of lime 
juice, which adds a savory deliciousness that I hope you’ll 
recognize as the level the avocado sauces you’ve been 
eating have been lacking. This recipe was inspired by the 
sacred Venezuelan culinary text Mi Cocina a la Manera 
de Caracas,  and so there are still chunky parts of avocado 
in the sauce. The health properties of avocado seeds are 
legendary. It won’t help the taste, but try grating some 
seed into the sauce whenever you’re using avocados.

BASESalsa de Mani is among South America’s most 
versatile, if not internationally recognized, sauces. 
You can roast and grind peanuts to make this the long 
way, or shortcut by using peanut butter. What results is 
a creamy sauce that is not limited to traditional potato 
or yucca patties (called llapingachos , similar to arepas) 
but is versatile enough for chicken, fries, pork, veggies, or 
nearly all types of seafood. You can add a little ground 
cumin and coriander to brighten up the sauce. Marcelo 
Panta of Canoa in Ecuador was generous enough to teach 
me how to make this sauce.
1 large red onion, 
chopped, divided
½ tomato, chopped
2½ cups water
½ pound (about 1½ cups) 
peanuts, chopped, or ½ cup 
peanut butter
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon achiote oil

1. In a medium saucepan, stir to combine half of the onion and the 
tomato with the water. Bring to a boil. Boil over medium heat for 
10 minutes, or until the onion is soft and the liquid thickens.63

3. Return the mixture to the saucepan, and bring to a boil 
again over low heat. Heat until desired consistency is achieved, 
 somewhere between the thickness of ketchup or yogurt, about 
15 to 20 minutes. Stir in the achiote oil.
4. In a large pan over medium-  low heat, heat the olive oil. Add the 
other half of the onion and the bell pepper and lightly fry until 
the onions turn golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the veggies  
to the mix, and stir.

dIPPINGPebre  is simply the most Chilean of sauces. There 
are two versions: One is heavy on the chili paste 
and lighter on the tomato, and this one is more like 
pico de gallo  from Mexico or vinaigrette  in Brazil. José 
Manuel Simián— whose Chilean roots run deep— calls 
pebre a state of mind, noting that how a Chilean prefers 
their pebre says a lot about them. Some like to (unjustly, 
according to him) soften the onion with water or skip 
the garlic. If you want to try replicating the Chilean 
experience, look for Portuguese rolls, as they are closest to 
the marraqueta , the Chilean version of the baguette. Slice 
them in half, toast them, add a little bit of butter, and then 
layer the pebre on top. Pebre is also part of a Chilean 
idiomatic expression: If someone “made pebre out of you,” 
it means they beat you up. This recipe— an alternative to 
pico— is offered in peace.

MIX INChimichurri is a mainstay at my backyard parrilladas . 
The South American green sauce can go on nearly 
anything that comes off the grill. The basic recipe uses 
parsley, oregano, oil, and red wine vinegar. However, 
it often isn’t communicated how much gets added by 
proper execution and taking the time to hand chop the 
ingredients. Avoid a food processor on this one and 
meticulously cut the parsley yourself. This recipe comes 
from Petry Fernández Díaz, who runs the Buenos Aires–
based barbecue company Nice to Meat You .
4 or 5 whole garlic cloves, 
unpeeled
2 bunches fresh flat-leaf 
parsley (about 6 ounces 
total), stemmed and 
carefully minced
2 tablespoons minced fresh 
oregano or tarragon leaves
1 teaspoon crushed red 
pepper flakes3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 
or sherry vinegar
1¼ cups extra- virgin olive oil
Coarse sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Juice and zest of 1 lemon
1 tablespoon sweet paprika

MIDDLE EAST, 
AFRICA, EASTERN 
MEDITERRANEAN, 
AND CAUCASUSTHIS CHAPTER STRETCHES FROM THE EASTERN 
Mediterranean and the Caucasus south through the 
Middle East and then into Africa. The diversity of culture 
and geography is reflected in the sauces curated for 
this chapter. Not that there aren’t common flavors and 
ingredients: Garlic, cilantro, parsley, chiles, tomatoes, and bell peppers 
are interwoven. However, this chapter begins with a tart, sweet Georgian 
plum sauce (page 74) and ends with a funky South African barbecue 
sauce evocatively named Monkey Gland Sauce (page 102), which 
contains zero guts of primates but might be the tangiest version of 
barbecue sauce on the planet.
In between, you may notice some familiar names, and some sauces 
you may be more acquainted with than you realize. Baba Ghanoush 
(page 84) has an international presence. Harissa (page 92) and 
Chermoula (page 90) do as well, though in this book, you’ll find they 
have switched colors to reflect regional differences.
Haydari and Cacik (page 76), relatives of the Greek tzatziki, represent 
the classic yogurt dipping sauce. Jajik (page 80) is another member 
of the family— an Assyrian dairy- based sauce that is perfect as part of 
a meze tray (think: appetizer) with some of the other recipes in this 
section: Baba Ghanoush, Hummus (page 86), Toum (page 94), Zhoug 
(page 96). . . . Make them all! Muhammara (page 78), like the Jajik recipe, 
was generously provided by Kathryn Pauline of Cardamom and Tea , 
which happens to be just the loveliest Assyrian food blog on the Internet.
Middle East and North African (known as MENA) cuisine is my jam. 
Full stop. So I appealed to Spices  contributor Beeta Mohajeri to share her 
mother’s pomegranate stew sauce, Khoresh Fesenjoon (page 82). For this 
sauce (and for several in this section) you’ll need to get your hands on 
pomegranate molasses. Its tart sweetness is a peerless culinary tool.
Though you may not be familiar with every sauce or every name, 
you’ll find the recipes easy to learn and relatively simple to make and 
use. More than that, most of them are effortless to share. Whether it’s in 
mezes or as part of larger shared main plates, using food to make that 
connection with folks is why this chapter stands out, and why I hope it is 
the most used chapter of the book.

POUR OVERTkemali  is a tart plum sauce made from a green cherry 
plum called alycha , though different types can be 
used to vary the color and sweetness. This recipe comes 
from Margarita Gerliani, whose dad is from Svaneti, in 
the north of Georgia high in the mountains. They use 
utskho suneli  (blue fenugreek), an herb that grows wild 
in the mountainous parts of northern Georgian. Another 
ingredient, Svanuri marili — a spiced salt— originates from 
the same region. Margarita told me Tkemali sauce goes 
best with shashlik and lyulya kebabs (think shish kebabs) 
or fish. It also works as a salad dressing. Adding the plum 
water at the end helps make it a thin sauce, but if you 
want it a bit thicker, try cooking it down or even adding a 
bit of cornstarch.
1 pound green cherry plums 
or seasonal plums of 
your choice
1 tablespoon chopped fresh 
cilantro
1 teaspoon ground coriander
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon hot paprika
2 teaspoons Svanuri marili  
(see Ingredient tip)1 teaspoon dried blue 
fenugreek (see Ingredient tip)
Sugar (optional)
Salt
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Food processor or mortar 
and pestle
1. Put the cherry plums in a medium saucepan, add cold water to 
the top of the pan, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Cover and 
cook until the plums are very soft, about 15 minutes (depending on 
the variety of plums). Set aside to cool. Pour the water from the 
cooked plums into a bowl and reserve.75
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS MIdd LE EAST , AFRICA , EASTERN  MEdITERRANEAN , AN d CAUCASUS |2. Strain the plums through a colander to separate the stones and 
skin from the pulp. Push the flesh with the back of a wooden spoon 
to get the most pulp you can. Transfer the flesh to the saucepan.
3. In a small bowl, combine the cilantro, coriander, garlic, paprika, 
Svanuri marili, and blue fenugreek. Then grind them with the help 
of a mortar and pestle or a food processor.
4. Add the spice mixture to the pan with the plum pulp. Cook over 
low heat for 30 to 40 minutes, until you have a thick sauce. Stir in 
some of the reserved plum water to make a thinner sauce.
5. Stir in the sugar, if using, and season with salt.
STORAGE:  2 to 4 days in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic 
 container, or 2 to 3 months frozen in a plastic container
INGREDIENT TIP:  Svanuri marili (Svaneti salt) is a seasoning mixture 
made of spices, garlic, and salt. If you can’t find it online, use crushed 
garlic, black pepper, coriander, crushed red pepper flakes and salt in 
equal parts. Blue fenugreek is an herb that is not easily replicated but 
can be found easily online. About 5 ground fenugreek seeds is a substi -
tute for 1 teaspoon blue fenugreek, if needed.MAINS

SPREA dLike Creole Remoulade and Comeback Sauce 
(page 46), Haydari  and Cacik  are relatives, and both 
can easily be made from almost the same ingredients. 
Haydari is a bit thicker and doesn’t usually contain 
cucumbers. Cacik does, and the viscosity ranges from a 
Jajik (page 80) to more like a cold soup. This recipe is for 
a thicker version of both sauces, which are ideal in a meze 
(appetizer platter), to share with many other sauces and 
snacks. Sumac is a tangy dried berry that is usually sold 
ground. Find it in the spice aisle or online. I owe a debt of 
gratitude to Beril Guceri and her Turkish mother Semra 
for their consult.
2 cups full- fat plain yogurt (or 
1½ cups Greek yogurt and 
skip step 1)
2 cucumbers, diced (optional 
for Cacik)
Salt
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons extra- virgin 
olive oil
3 tablespoons grated 
feta cheese2 tablespoons chopped 
fresh dill
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed 
lemon juice
1 teaspoon ground sumac
¼ cup chopped walnuts 
(optional for Haydari; omit 
for Nut Free)
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Cheesecloth, mortar and pestle 
(or a spoon or knife)
1. Line a colander with a couple of layers of cheesecloth. Pour in 
the yogurt, and cover with plastic wrap. Let drain for several hours 
or overnight in the refrigerator.77

with a small handful of salt. Let sit for 30 minutes to an hour. 
Drain and rinse the cucumbers, pat dry, and set aside.
3. In your mortar and pestle, or with the back of a spoon or side of 
a knife, crush the garlic into a finer paste.
4. In a large bowl, mix the oil and yogurt. Add the garlic, and 
season with salt. Add the feta, dill, lemon juice, sumac, and walnuts 
(if using), and stir.
5. Add the cucumbers from step 2, if using, and mix. Let rest for 
several minutes before serving.
STORAGE:  2 to 4 days in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic 
container
INGREDIENT TIP:  High- quality feta and yogurt or labneh  (cheese made 
from strained yogurt) make a huge difference. While not traditional, 
adding a bit of softened cream cheese can smooth both sauces out, or 
thicken if they’re watery. If you can find goat or sheep’s strained yogurt, 
try using that. It is thick like Greek yogurt (so you can skip step 1) and 
is sometimes available at Middle Eastern specialty shops.MAINS

MIX INMuhammar  means “reddened” in Arabic, which is no 
surprise when you take a look at the ingredients list. 
The dish is made up mostly of charred red bell peppers 
flavored with deep red pomegranate molasses and 
intensified with a bit of crushed red pepper flakes. Look 
for deeply red bell peppers for a bright and flavorful final 
product. Kathryn Pauline, who writes the blog Cardamom 
and Tea , is a virtuoso of Assyrian cuisine. She shared 
this recipe with the assurance that Muhammara packs 
a punch and can be used to add a little sweet and sour to 
just about any weeknight meal.
3 small red bell peppers
¼ cup finely chopped walnuts
¼ cup plain breadcrumbs
½ teaspoon ground cumin
1 small garlic clove, minced
2 tablespoons pomegranate 
molasses (see Ingredient tip)Crushed red pepper flakes
½ teaspoon salt
Extra- virgin olive oil, 
for serving
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Food processor
1. Place the red peppers directly over the flame of a gas burner on 
medium-  high heat. Use tongs to rotate them until they’re charred 
all over on the outside, roughly 8 minutes. (If you don’t have a gas 
stove, broil the peppers on the highest setting or use an outdoor 
grill.) Place in a small bowl and cover with plastic wrap to sweat 
them for 30 minutes.79
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS MIdd LE EAST , AFRICA , EASTERN  MEdITERRANEAN , AN d CAUCASUS |2. Place a medium skillet over medium heat for a minute. 
Once heated, add the walnuts and breadcrumbs. Stir as you cook 
for 5 minutes or so, until the aroma is toasty and everything 
begins to brown. Stir in the cumin and garlic in the final minute, 
and set aside.
3. Remove the skins of the peppers with your hands or a paper 
towel. Pat dry and discard the seeds, ribs, stems, and liquid.
4. Place the peppers in the food processor and mix. Add the walnut 
mixture, pomegranate molasses, crushed red pepper flakes, and 
salt, and pulse until it becomes a mostly smooth paste but with 
small chunks.
5. Transfer to a bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and serve.
STORAGE:  4 to 5 days in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic con -
tainer, or freeze in tablespoon- size chunks on parchment paper and 
then keep for up to 3 months in a freezer bag
INGREDIENT TIP:  Pomegranate molasses is the essential ingredient. 
A supermarket with a good international section, world markets, and 
Asian markets should have it. You’ll also find it online.
REPURPOSING TIP:  Manakish muhammara is a wonderful bread 
you can make with this recipe and pizza dough. Roll the dough out 
as you would to make little 8- inch pizzas, and top each with a layer 
of muhammara. Then bake on a preheated pizza stone at 450°F for 
5 to 10 minutes.MAINS

CONd IMENTJajik is a dairy- based dip from Iraq. It’s often eaten 
for breakfast, but can also be part of a meze tray, 
along with other classics like Baba Ghanoush (page 84) 
and Hummus (page 86) and some bread. This is an 
adaptation of Kathryn Pauline’s family’s Assyrian 
version, with a cottage cheese and cream cheese base 
flavored with dill. But it’s also delicious made with labneh 
(a soft cheese made from strained yogurt) and can 
include banana peppers, parsley, mint, garlic, and grated 
cucumber, or use whatever herbs you have on hand. Make 
sure you add the ingredients in the right order. If you add 
the herbs too early, or if you don’t mix them in carefully, 
the whole thing will turn green. Also make sure you wash 
and dry your herbs before chopping, which will make the 
Jajik stay fresher, and will also keep it from turning green.
8 ounces cream cheese, at 
room temperature
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, 
at room temperature
1 pound small curd 
cottage cheese
¼ teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons chopped 
fresh dill3 tablespoons chopped fresh 
cilantro
2 tablespoons chopped 
scallions, green parts only
Extra- virgin olive oil, 
for garnish
Chopped fresh herbs, 
for garnish
1. In a medium mixing bowl, mix the cream cheese and butter 
together. Mix in the cottage cheese, and stir until everything is 
very evenly mixed together. Season with the salt.81

SERVING IDEAS MIdd LE EAST , AFRICA , EASTERN  MEdITERRANEAN , AN d CAUCASUS |2. Carefully fold in the dill, cilantro, and scallions.
3. When everything is evenly combined, store in the refrigerator 
for later, or serve right away. To serve, spoon into a serving bowl, 
drizzle with extra-  virgin olive oil, and garnish with the fresh herbs.
STORAGE:  4 to 5 days in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic 
container
REPURPOSING TIP:  Most traditionally, Jajik is not really used as a 
sauce for proteins. But less traditionally, it’s really delicious served 
alongside roast chicken, and it goes wonderfully with beans and 
 legumes, especially fava beans.MAINS

COOK INKhoresh Fesenjoon , informally known as  fesenjan  
or fessenjoon , is a wonderfully tart Persian 
pomegranate stew. While it is commonly a sauce for 
chicken, regional differences and possible variants 
include lamb, duck (for special occasions), or vegetarian 
options like squash or eggplant. Beeta Mohajeri, an old 
friend and dynamic private chef, offered this recipe from 
her mother, Mama Fariba. I’m told Persian mothers make 
a big batch and freeze to use when desired. You can do 
the same. Serve over saffron rice.
5 tablespoons butter or 
coconut oil (for Dairy Free)
2 large onions, thinly sliced
1 teaspoon salt
2 pounds boneless chicken 
thighs, cubed, or stew 
ingredients of your choice
½ pound shelled walnuts
½ cup pomegranate molasses 
dissolved in 2 cups water½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon ground saffron 
dissolved in 1 tablespoon 
hot water
2 tablespoons sugar, as needed
Pomegranate seeds (optional)
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Food processor, large 
Dutch oven
1. In a large Dutch oven over medium heat, melt the butter. 
Add the onions and brown for 6 to 8 minutes, until golden and 
translucent. Add the salt.
2. Add the chicken thighs, and sear until golden brown, about 
10 minutes.83

3. In a food processor, grind the walnuts very fine, then add 2 cups 
of the diluted pomegranate water, the cinnamon, and the saffron 
water. Mix into a creamy paste.
4. If the pomegranate-  walnut paste is too sour, add sugar to taste 
until you get a balanced sweet and sour flavor. Add more molasses 
to sour it, more sugar to sweeten.
5. Transfer the pomegranate-  walnut paste to the Dutch oven. 
Cover and simmer for 1½ hours, stirring occasionally with a spoon 
to prevent the nut paste from burning on the bottom. If the stew is 
too thick, add warm water to thin it out.
6. Transfer the stew to an oven- proof casserole dish. Cover with 
foil and keep warm in a preheated oven until ready to serve. 
Garnish with pomegranate seeds just before serving for a lovely 
texture and appearance.
STORAGE:  1 week in the refrigerator in a glass jar, or several months in 
the freezer in a freezer bag
REPURPOSING TIP:  Serve with Persian- style rice, jeweled with 
 saffron water. Cook basmati rice according to the package. Scoop out 
1/3 cup of cooked rice and set aside. Mix a small pinch of saffron with 
2 tablespoons of warm water. Let it dissolve, then mix the saffron water 
into the reserved rice. It will turn a beautiful orange. Use this to top 
your basmati rice.MAINS

CONd IMENTBaba Ghanoush is a Middle Eastern eggplant dip and 
sauce that can be used as part of a meze or spooned 
over any number of dishes. This recipe comes from 
Maryanne Wageh Guirguis and is great with anything 
from couscous to shish kebabs. The simple way to cook 
the eggplant is by broiling it, but the more adventurous 
should turn it over the flame on a gas stove or grill to 
accentuate the smoky flavor it releases. Tahini is a paste 
made from ground sesame seeds. You’ll find it in many 
supermarkets and online. It may look a little oily when 
you open the jar; just stir to incorporate any oil that’s 
risen to the top.
1 large eggplant
¼ cup tahini, plus more 
as needed
3 garlic cloves, minced
¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon 
juice, plus more as needed
Pinch ground cuminSalt
1 tablespoon extra- virgin 
olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh 
flat-leaf parsley
¼ cup brine-  cured black olives, 
such as Kalamata (optional)
1. Prepare a medium-  hot fire in a charcoal grill and preheat the 
oven to 375°F.
2. Prick the eggplant with a fork in several places. To char on a 
charcoal grill, place on the grill rack 4 to 5 inches from the fire. 
Grill, turning frequently, until the skin blackens and blisters 
and the flesh just begins to feel soft, 10 to 15 minutes. To char 85

20 to 30 minutes. To char on a gas flame on the stovetop, hold  
over the flame with tongs. Rotate the eggplant repeatedly until  
the skin is papery and evenly charred.
3. Transfer the eggplant to a baking sheet and bake until very soft, 
15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, let cool slightly, and peel 
off and discard the skin.
4. Place the eggplant flesh in a medium bowl. Using a fork, mash 
the eggplant to a paste. Add the tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and 
cumin, and mix well. Season with salt, then taste and add more 
tahini and/or lemon juice, if needed.
5. Transfer the mixture to a serving bowl, and use the back of a 
spoon to form a shallow well. Drizzle the olive oil over the top, 
and sprinkle with the parsley. Place the olives around the sides 
(if using).
6. Serve at room temperature.
STORAGE:  6 days in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic container; 
freeze for 2 months by setting the Baba Ghanoush over cheesecloth in 
a colander and letting it drain for 30 minutes, then put in a freezer bag 
with the air squeezed out, or vacuum seal

SPREA dThe word hummus derives from the Arabic word 
for chickpeas, which were cultivated in the 
Mediterranean and Middle East thousands of years ago. 
The exact origin of hummus is contested, but the earliest 
mentions date back to thirteenth-century Egypt. There 
is a vast difference between the hummus you get in tubs 
at the store and the hummus made at home by an expert 
with a mortar and pestle. This recipe, from Erene Mina, 
will teach you the basics of making a restaurant- quality 
hummus at home. It calls for cooking the chickpeas from 
scratch, but you can substitute a 15- ounce can of cooked 
chickpeas, drained and rinsed well, then start with step 3.
2/3 cup dried chickpeas
½ teaspoon baking soda
¼ cup water, divided, plus extra 
for thinning
3 tablespoons tahini
3 tablespoons freshly squeezed 
lemon juice
1 tablespoon white vinegar2 small garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon ground cumin
Salt
2 tablespoons extra- virgin 
olive oil
1 tablespoon smoked paprika
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Food processor
1. Soak the chickpeas overnight in enough cold water to cover by 
2 to 3 inches, and stir in the baking soda (to help with digestion). 
If you did not start the night before, soak the chickpeas for an 
hour in hot water. Drain, and rinse the chickpeas thoroughly with 
cold water.87
 MIdd LE EAST , AFRICA , EASTERN  MEdITERRANEAN , AN d CAUCASUS |PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS
2. Place the chickpeas in a large pot, cover with cold water, and 
bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for 
90 minutes, stirring and checking from time to time for doneness 
(you want them very tender). Drain well. If you have the patience, 
peel them from their skins.
3. In the food processor, combine the chickpeas and 2 tablespoons 
of water, and process, stopping and scraping down the sides and 
bottom of the bowl as needed. Add the tahini, lemon juice, vinegar, 
and 2 tablespoons of water, and mix until well incorporated and 
creamy. Add the garlic, cumin, and salt, and mix again.
4. If the mixture is too thick for your taste, mix in 2 more table -
spoons of water. Taste to adjust the salt.
5. Serve drizzled with the olive oil and paprika.
STORAGE:  4 to 5 days in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic con -
tainer, with a thin layer of olive oil on top, or 3 months in the freezer in 
a freezer bag or plastic container
REPURPOSING TIP:  Use as a sandwich spread instead of mustard, 
mayonnaise, or peanut butter. Or change the flavor profile; hummus is 
an amazing vehicle for adding your favorite ingredients. Try mixing 
in ground chipotle chili pepper while processing. Or before serving, mix 
in whole pomegranate seeds or pine nuts.MAINS

COOK INFilfel Chuma  is used often as a condiment in 
Libyan-Jewish and Israeli cooking. It is essentially 
a garlic hot sauce that sort of represents a marriage 
between Toum (page 94) and Harissa (page 92). In fact, 
my pal Shawn Bunkheila mentioned that his family often 
uses the same ingredients and just calls it harissa. The 
street his Libyan father, Ghazi, grew up on had a large 
Jewish community who referred to it by the name listed, 
Filfel Chuma. This sauce is perfect for widespread use, 
especially for Americans. My mom, who is Italian, says 
Americans often overuse garlic when only a little is 
needed. So this sauce is for those who unapologetically 
slather as much garlic as possible onto foods, but who

cloves by degerming them. Slice each clove in half lengthwise, 
then use your finger to take out the little stem in the middle of the 
garlic clove, as it’s usually a bit sour, especially in old garlic.
3. In a small, dry pan over medium heat, toast the cumin and 
caraway seeds for 1 minute. Let cool, and grind in the spice grinder 
or mortar and pestle.
4. In a skillet over medium-  low heat, heat 1 tablespoon of oil. 
Add the garlic, and sauté until aromatic and just starting to wilt 
and turn golden.
5. In a food processor, combine the chiles, garlic, toasted seeds, 
cayenne pepper, paprika, lemon juice, lemon zest, salt, and the 
remaining ¼ cup plus 3 tablespoons oil, and mix until smooth. 
Add extra oil if the sauce is too thick.
STORAGE:  1 week in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic container,

CONd IMENTWhile I was in Tunisia investigating spices and 
blends for Cooking with Spices , I waltzed into the 
charming guesthouse Dar Souad in Tunis, armed with the 
understanding that chermoula  is a spicy green sauce (as 
is the custom in Morocco and much of the Maghreb). The 
proprietor, Raja Maatar, explained that she would serve 
chermoula (also spelled charmoula) for breakfast. Raja 
kindly taught my cohorts and me that in Tunisia, it is 
reddish, sweet, and delicate. She was kind enough to lend 
me her recipe on the condition I come back to Tunisia 
and cook it with her.
1¾ cups (½ pound) 
black raisins
1 quart water
Just under 1 cup extra- virgin 
olive oil, plus extra for 
drizzling
4 cups red onions (1 pound 
total), cut into strips
½ teaspoon ground cubeb 
pepper or freshly ground 
black pepper (see 
Ingredient tip)2 teaspoons ground dried 
Damask rosebuds (see 
Ingredient tip)
½ teaspoon ground cloves
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon ground 
cayenne pepper
½ teaspoon sweet paprika
½ teaspoon ground turmeric
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Blender, large cast iron pan or 
Dutch oven
1. Thoroughly wash the raisins several times to remove impurities, 
then drain and place in a large bowl. Pour in the water, and soak 
for 40 minutes. Transfer to a blender with the water, and blend to 
a mash. Push the raisin mash through a fine colander or sieve and 
mix to extract the juice.91
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS MIdd LE EAST , AFRICA , EASTERN  MEdITERRANEAN , AN d CAUCASUS |2. In a large skillet over very low heat, heat the oil. Add the onions 
and cook for 2 hours, until they turn into a mash.
3. Pour the raisin mash in the pan. Stir in the cubeb, rosebuds, 
cloves, cinnamon, cayenne, paprika, and turmeric. Continue 
 cooking for 2 more hours over low heat, until the sauce 
becomes thick.
4. Let cool and serve with a little more oil drizzled on top.
STORAGE:  1 month in a glass jar with a spoonful of olive oil on top 
to seal it
INGREDIENT TIP:  Dried rosebuds can usually be found in teashops and 
specialty spice stores. If you can’t find them at your local herbalist or 
apothecary, they are readily available online. Cubeb pepper can be 
ordered online and is easily replaced with black pepper, long pepper, 
or grains of paradise.MAINS

SPREA d
MIX INHarissa is a popular condiment used all over North 
Africa and the Middle East. The most memorable 
harissa to ever hit my taste buds was in Tunisia. The 
kebab shop was open for prayer at roughly 3 a.m. 
and they slathered it on, hoping to catch my travel 
companions and me off guard with the spice level. 
Instead, it was paradise on my tongue. That was a red 
harissa, and my recreation of that spellbinder is in my 
previous book, Cooking with Spices . Green harissa is 
milder and less piquant than its more famous red cousin. 
As for the peppers, go with what’s fresh. If your market 
has great- looking serrano peppers, pick those over 
soggy- looking jalapeños. I definitely recommend using 
whole spices for this recipe.
2 teaspoons coriander seeds
2 teaspoons cumin seeds
¼ cup extra- virgin olive 
oil, divided
4 jalapeño or green serrano 
chiles, stemmed and seeded
3 garlic cloves, peeled
1 small handful fresh parsley
1 small handful fresh 
mint leaves1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon apple 
cider vinegar
Salt
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Spice grinder or mortar and 
pestle, food processor
1. In a small, dry pan over medium heat, toast the coriander and 
cumin seeds for 1 to 2 minutes to release their flavors. Let cool, and 
grind in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle.93
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS MIdd LE EAST , AFRICA , EASTERN  MEdITERRANEAN , AN d CAUCASUS |2. In a medium skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon of oil. 
When hot, add the chiles and garlic and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes, 
until the edges brown.
3. Transfer to a food processor, and add the ground spices, parsley, 
mint, lemon juice, and vinegar. As the processor runs, drizzle in 
the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil.
4. Season with salt.
STORAGE:  2 weeks in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic con -
tainer, or 6 months in the freezer in small plastic containers or frozen 
into cubes
REPURPOSING TIP:  This can easily be made into red harissa by substi -
tuting reconstituted dried red chiles instead of the jalapeños. For more 
heat, leave in more of the stems, ribs, and seeds of the chile peppers. 
For less heat, remove them completely.MAINS

MARINAd ETJ Jawad Trad grew up sitting on the counter, 
watching his grandfather make this delicious 
Lebanese garlic sauce. Now he’s the one who makes it 
for the entire family when they get together. It parallels 
the taste and texture of its relatives skordalia  in Greece, 
tooma  in Egypt and alioli  in Spain. Garlic is not as strong 
of an emulsifier as egg, for example in mayo, so following 
the steps to the letter is important if not using one. 
According to TJ, the perfect Toum has to be fluffy, potent, 
and white. Using vegetable oil instead of olive oil will 
help avoid making it yellowish. To make Toum that lasts 
longer, do not use egg whites (according to TJ’s aunt). But 
note that without the egg it will be harder to emulsify.
½ cup garlic cloves, peeled
1 teaspoon salt
1 egg white, divided
1½ cups vegetable oil, divided
¼ cup cold water, divided¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon 
juice (from about 2 lemons)
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED

 process again.
3. With the food processor running, very slowly add half of the 
egg white. Then very slowly add ½ cup of oil. Very slowly add 
1/8 cup of water.
4. With the processor still running, slowly add the remaining 
egg white, then another ½ cup of oil, then the remaining 1/8 cup 
of water. Very slowly add the remaining ½ cup of oil, and finally, 
the lemon juice. This emulsification process should take about 
15 minutes.

labeled the Yemeni version of each. It took on several 
name variations as it spread to Syria and Israel, such 
as zhug , sahawiq , and skhug . In all iterations, cilantro 
is the main component. It goes well on a variety of foods 
that the herbaceous quality of fresh herbs enhances. Fish, 
chicken, sandwiches, and pita are all instruments to carry 
the freshness of Zhoug to your senses. If, like me, you’re 
one of those people for whom cilantro tastes like soap, 
perhaps you should skip to parsley- based Harissa Verte

COOK INBerbere is a cherished spice mix from Ethiopia that 
rouses the flavor in most stews and soups. Since the 
rub goes well on most foods, it is easily converted to a 
stew sauce by adding red wine and chicken or vegetable 
stock. Cook it down to a thicker sauce for stewed or seared 
lamb and steak. I always prefer to grind my own spices 
to maximize the flavor and freshness of the spice oils. 
This book is made for ease, so feel free to go with ground 
spices. Just know that toasting your spices whole and 
grinding them fresh will heighten the flavor significantly.

2. In a medium skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon of

that have collected in the bowl until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes.
3. In a small bowl, mix the cardamom, coriander, cloves, pepper,

4. Turn the heat to medium-  low, then add the spice mixture and 
the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the pan. Stir to coat the 
onions evenly.
5. Immediately add the wine, cinnamon stick, and tomato paste, 
and stir. When mixed thoroughly, simmer for 5 minutes. Then add 
the stock.
6. For a thinner sauce for fish and lentils, simmer for about 
10 minutes. For a thicker sauce for poultry and meats, simmer for 
about 20 minutes. Remove the cinnamon stick and serve.

INGREDIENT TIP:  This recipe easily converts to vegan—simply use a 
vegetable stock instead of chicken stock.

COOK INThis recipe comes from Jack Hatzfeld and James 
Kihara Munuhe. James is from Nairobi and grew 
up teaching his cousin Jack songs and phrases in 
Swahili. When it came time to name this sauce, which 
according to the pair “embodies the flavors and spices 
used in Kenya,” they went with Simba Kali , which means 
“fierce lion.” The sauce itself is a variation on a widely 
used tomato sauce, intended to be used with almost 
anything except fish, which can’t as easily stand up to 
its flavor. If you prefer using fresh tomatoes, use roughly 
6 to 8 Roma tomatoes or any sweet, firm- when- peeled 
equivalent.
1½ teaspoon extra- virgin 
olive oil
1 (35-  ounce) can peeled 
tomatoes, such as 
San Marzano
½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
¼ teaspoon ground cloves
1½ tablespoons crushed red 
pepper flakes½ teaspoon ground cardamom
2 dried bay leaves
1 cinnamon stick
½ teaspoon ground allspice
½ cup beef stock (page xv)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh 
cilantro
Juice of ½ lemon
Salt
1. In a medium skillet over medium heat, heat the olive oil for 
1 minute. Pour in the tomatoes with their juices and cook, mixing, 
for 2 to 3 minutes. When soft, break up the tomatoes with a wooden 
spoon or mixing utensil.101

lemon juice, season with salt, and stir. Turn the heat to low.
3. Simmer uncovered for 1 hour, mixing every so often.
4. Remove the cinnamon and bay leaves, if you prefer, and serve.
STORAGE:  1 to 2 weeks in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic

dIPPINGThere are no primate parts in this sauce. Legend 
has it that the sauce was developed at the storied 
but troubled Carlton Hotel in Johannesburg when the 
French chefs threw what they had available into a big pot: 
ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and mustard. The sauce 
was a hit, but what about the name? Another piece of 
sauce lore suggests Dr. Serge Voronoff— a Russian doctor 
who was experimenting with monkey sex glands and 
human male virility— frequented the Savoy Hotel in 
London, where a version of the sauce was served. Some 
Monkey Gland Sauce recipes call for ketchup, but mine, 
which was constructed with counsel from Yolandé van 
Heerden, is more vinegary than the kind they use in 
South Africa.
1 tablespoon vegetable oil or 
grapeseed oil
1 to 2 shallots, minced
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 (14-  ounce) can peeled 
tomatoes, chopped
¼ cup tomato paste
¾ cup chutney (see 
Ingredient tip)1 to 2 tablespoons brown sugar
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
3 tablespoons 
Worcestershire sauce
½ cup chicken stock (page xv)

1. In a medium skillet or saucepan over medium heat, heat the 
oil. Add the shallots and garlic, and cook until translucent, about 
2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and tomato paste, and stir. When 
sizzling, add the chutney, sugar, vinegar, and Worcestershire 
sauce. Stir.
2. Turn the heat to low. Add the chicken stock, stir, and simmer 
uncovered for 30 to 35 minutes, until a thick sauce develops. 
Add the Tabasco sauce, and season with salt and pepper.
STORAGE:  2 weeks in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic  container,

INGREDIENT TIP:  No monkey glands needed! But chutney certainly is 
a requirement. The classic brand to use is Mrs. Ball’s— which can be 
bought in many flavors online. However, I like to use Mango Chutney

EUROPEEUROPE IS HOME TO THE CLASSIC FRENCH SAUCES, 
but for a world sauces cookbook, the endeavor is to search 
beyond. As a New Orleans resident, I’m a card- carrying 
member of the roux fan club. So while I’m compelled to nod 
to those matriarch sauces and their children, in this chapter 
I want to purposefully steer you away from those heavy and thick French 
sauces and down the rabbit hole into the world of lesser known— and 
non- exhaustively covered— regions and sauces.
I retain from my grandmother, Nonna Yvelise, her Italian citizenship 
and passion for feeding people ragù (page 108). It is also a certainty in 
my family that although many have tried, Zia Elda, my great aunt, makes 
the pesto. Every time I go home to Chiavari, in the Italian Riviera, I plead 
with her to make it so I can again see the perfect consistency firsthand. 
My own has come a long way over the years.
These regional sauces— from a very specific place, and often a very 
specific family—  will bring you to an exact place and story. Rødgrød 
(page 130), I hope, transports you to the childhood garden home of Ole 
Storm Hansen, who shared it. Marti Buckley contributed Salsa Vizcaína 
(page 114), which will teleport your senses directly to Basque Country 
where I met her over pintxos . Her lens into Basque gastronomy and 
cuisine, through her blog Blank Palate , is unrivaled.
Like many of the sauces in this book, the recipe for the delightful 
Ajika (page 136) comes from the kind of European mother who will make 
a giant batch and freeze it for the winter months in vacuum- sealed jars. 
While it has stood the test of time, I had to cut it by two-  thirds so you 
don’t have to buy 5½ pounds of zucchini (but by all means, do so if you 
can— a canned jar of Ajika is a great gift).
It would be dubious to trust any sauce book without a mustard sauce 
(Senfsauce [page 128] here) and a horseradish sauce (Pepparrotsås 
[page 134]— in Nordic languages horseradish is translated as 
“pepper- root”). And, as in Wonderland when Alice ponders whether to 
consume a cake on top of which EAT ME is spelled out in currants, the 
lingonberries or cranberries in Sweden’s Lingonsås (page 132) might call 
you to do the same.

the family recipes from my Nonna. As a child, ravioli 
in ragù was one of the only foods I would voluntarily 
consume. Though Bolognese is the arguably most classic 
of Italian tomato pasta sauces, I have been raised to 
prefer this recipe— which admittedly takes some unholy 
liberties with the official version. But what tastes better 
than nostalgia? If you’re keen to know what made little 
Markino (as Nonna calls me) finally eat, this sauce is for 
you. I’ve added ground beef and two kinds of sausage 
here, but this ragù can be made with anything from 
veggies to llama meat (mother approved), or without 
a protein for a vegetarian tomato sauce.
2 tablespoons extra- virgin 
olive oil, divided, plus more 
as needed
2 garlic cloves, minced, divided
1 carrot, peeled and minced
½ onion, minced
1 celery stalk, minced
2 dried bay leaves
1 fresh rosemary sprig
2 tablespoons herbes de 
Provence
1/3 pound ground beef
1/3 pound Italian sausage meat1/3 pound spicy Italian 
sausage meat
½ cup white wine
½ cup chicken or vegetable 
stock (page xv)
1 handful pine nuts
Freshly ground black pepper
2 cups Simple Tomato Sauce 
(page xiv)
2 tablespoons tomato paste
½ cup grated Parmigiano-
Reggiano cheese
Salt109
 EUROPE |PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS
1. In a large, heavy sauté pan or Dutch oven over medium-  high 
heat, combine 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1 minced garlic clove, and 
the carrot, onion, celery, bay leaves, rosemary sprig, and herbes de 
Provence. Cook until the garlic begins to brown, about 5 minutes.
2. Return the pan to medium-  high heat. Heat the remaining 
1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the ground beef and sausage 
(or other protein) to the pan and brown until cooked through, 
about 5 minutes. Add a little more olive oil as needed. Pour in the 
wine and stock. Add the pine nuts, and season with pepper.
3. Pour the tomato sauce and paste into the pan with the meat, and 
mix. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let simmer, occasionally 
adding the cheese in handfuls and stirring until all is incorporated. 
The sauce should be thick and hearty but should also coat pasta 
evenly without being too chunky. This can take an hour or up to 
an hour and a half, but watch the sauce and stir occasionally so it 
doesn’t burn on the bottom of the pan. Season with salt.
STORAGE:  2 weeks in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic container 
or months in the freezer in plastic containers
REPURPOSING TIP:  If you’re making a regular tomato sauce without 
meat, just leave it out and keep going with the recipe. Alternatively, 
substitute ground turkey or chicken, tofu or tempeh, or add some pan- 
seared vegetables. If you don’t have a can of tomatoes for the Simple 
Tomato Sauce (page xiv), equal parts tomato paste and water with a 
pinch of salt and sugar will suffice.MAINS

POUR OVERLiguria, on the northwestern coast of Italy where my 
mother, Cristina, was born, is where pesto originated. 
Pesto, in its truest form, is made with basil and olive oil. 
In my unsolicited opinion, all others should be defined 
by type— arugula pesto, kale pesto, and so on— but 
never say “basil pesto.” That’s just pesto.  My Italian 
mother, grandmother, great aunt, and I have a running 
competition for who makes the best pesto. Of course, 
Zia Elda— my masterful great aunt— always makes it the 
best because she has a feel for putting in just the right 
amount of garlic (she says Americans tend to overdose, 
a theme in my family you’ll notice). She has nearly a 
century of experience, after all. This is how she does it.
4 generous handfuls fresh basil 
leaves, divided
1 cup extra- virgin olive 
oil, divided
¾ cup (about 3 ounces) grated 
Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese 
(see Ingredient tip)1 tablespoon pine nuts
1 or 2 garlic cloves, chopped
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Food processor
1. In a small saucepan of boiling water, very quickly blanch all the 
basil for 5 seconds to prevent darkening (my mom’s trick). Strain.
2. In the bowl of the food processor, combine about three- quarters 
of the basil with ¾ cup of olive oil, and process. Add 8 tablespoons 
of cheese while the food processor runs. Pulse the food processor, 
and add the pine nuts and garlic. (If you like it more garlicky, 
despite what Zia says, go ahead and add a bit more.)111
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS EUROPE |3. Dip a spoon in to taste. The consistency will depend on the size 
of the basil leaves and the oil you used. Balance and texture is the 
key. With the remaining ¼ cup of oil, ¼ cup of cheese, and basil, 
add small portions of each, as follows: If the pesto doesn’t drip off 
the spoon, then add a bit of oil until it is less thick. If it falls too 
readily— in a stream—  then add basil and cheese. You shouldn’t 
taste the cheese as the first, most forward flavor, so add more oil 
and basil if you do.
STORAGE:  1 week in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic container, 
or 6 months in the freezer; use small plastic containers and freeze in 
portion sizes
INGREDIENT TIP:  Not all Parmesan cheese is Parmesan cheese. Italian 
cheese producers were successful in getting Parmigiano DOC status, 
which is certification of origin and production standards and a pro -
tection against fakes. However, in the United States, such protection is 
given only for the word Parmigiano— meaning that “Parmesan cheese” 
will likely not be Parmigiano. Do yourself and your taste buds a favor 
and buy Parmigiano-Reggiano (you’ll see it imprinted on the rind).MAINS

COOK INRomesco is a Catalan sauce originally made by 
fishermen in the region to accompany the catch. 
There are definitive regional Catalan variations: 
salvitxada  (thinner, vinegar- based, and poured on a 
variety of charred green onions called calçots ) and xató  
(an endive and salted cod salad generally served with 
romesco). Romesco, however, has transformed from using 
reconstituted ñora peppers and blanched almonds to 
sauces with all manner of capsicums and hazelnuts or 
walnuts. Vince Mancini provided his version, which nods 
to salvitxada by incorporating charred scallion into the 
sauce itself.
1 red bell pepper
1 ripe, golf- ball- size tomato
1 large scallion, trimmed 
and cleaned
3 or 4 whole garlic cloves, 
unpeeled
2 teaspoons smoked Spanish 
pimentón (paprika)
2 medallion- size (½- inch) 
French baguette slices2 tablespoons sherry vinegar
1 teaspoon salt
3 heaping tablespoons 
Marcona almonds or 
slivered almonds
About 1/3 cup extra- virgin olive 
oil, as needed
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Food processor, broiler or gas 
range/grill
1. Set an oven rack to the middle, and preheat your broiler to high.
2. In a small broiler pan, place the red bell pepper, tomato,  
scallion, and garlic. Broil on high, turning every 5 minutes, 
for about 10 minutes for the onion, 15 minutes for the tomato 113
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS EUROPE |and garlic, and 25 minutes for the pepper, until the pepper is 
 “leoparded” (as much black char as red on the skin). Or char the 
skins over the flame on your gas range, using a pair of tongs. The 
skin of the tomato should blacken and split, becoming easy to 
peel off. The garlic should get soft enough that you can squish it 
between your fingers. The scallion should have a good char, too.
3. Let everything cool, then peel the skins off the pepper, garlic, 
and tomato. Seed and stem the pepper.
4. In the food processor, combine the cooked vegetables, paprika, 
baguette, vinegar, and salt, and pulse into a purée. Add the 
almonds, and pulse. Then add the olive oil while the processor is 
running, and process until smooth but chunky. It should appear 
like chunky mashed potatoes but stir thinner, like pesto.
5. Transfer to a bowl and let cool for 20 to 30 minutes so the 
flavors can blend.
STORAGE:  1 to 2 weeks in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic 
 container, or 6 weeks in the freezer in plastic containers

BASEOne of the Basque Country’s most beloved sauces, 
Salsa Vizcaína is also one of its most versatile. 
Bizkaia, its namesake province, is on the coast, so this 
sauce is often made with salted cod in the dish Bakailaoa 
Bizkaiko Erara. It appears in a similar form with salted 
cod in Marti Buckley’s iconic cookbook Basque Country,  
though there are as many versions as Basque home cooks. 
Some incorporate ham, others throw in shellfish, so feel 
free to tinker as you see fit. This sauce also makes a great 
base for a red pasta sauce or a minestrone- type vegetable 
soup. Marti notes that Basque cooks will use flour or 
a piece of bread to solidify or thicken the sauce.
12 dried choricero peppers

1. In a small bowl, reconstitute the peppers in the warm water for 
up to an hour. Drain and dry. Stem and seed the peppers, scrape 
the pulp from the skin with a knife, and discard the skin. Set the 
choricero pulp aside.115
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS EUROPE |2. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat the olive oil. 
Add the garlic. When the garlic starts to “dance” and turns golden, 
remove from the oil and discard. Add the onions and parsley to 
the pan, and cook until the onions are golden and softened, about 
5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, and drain any excess 
oil. Add the pepper pulp, and return the pan to medium-  high heat 
for about 30 seconds. Add the stock and tomato sauce. Cook for 
5 minutes, until the sauce is mixed and slightly thickened.
3. Pour the sauce into a food mill and press through with a bit of 
force using a ladle or wooden spoon. Discard the solids.
4. Return the liquid sauce to the saucepan and heat for 
5 to 10 minutes, until nice and thick.
5. If you’re using this sauce for fish, ham, meatballs, or another 
protein, finish them by cooking them in the sauce for their final 
minutes to warm them through and absorb the flavors.
STORAGE:  1 to 2 weeks in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic

POUR OVERSauce forestière  means sauce “of the forest,” and 
generally refers to wild mushrooms in cream over 
a base of poultry, beef, or fish that can be paired with 
pasta or potatoes. For this recipe, I went to Travis 
Nicks, who uses more mushrooms in cooking than 
anyone I know. What makes Travis such a fun guy is his 
particularity  when it comes to cooking with mushrooms. 
He recommends king oyster mushrooms for this sauce, 
or fresh shiitake or porcini as a distant second and third.
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
½ pound king oyster, shiitake, 
or porcini mushrooms, 
diced small
1 shallot, chopped
1 (½- inch) piece fresh 
ginger, minced
¼ cup dry white wine or rosé
½ cup heavy (whipping) creamSplash port or madeira wine

1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
1 teaspoon chopped 
fresh parsley

1. In a medium skillet over low heat, melt the butter until the foam 
dissipates. Add the mushrooms, and sauté for 5 minutes, until 
softened and golden. Add the shallot and ginger, and cook until 
browned, 2 to 5 minutes more.117
PAIRINGS AND

to remove any harshness. Add the heavy cream, wine, and port 
(if using), and mix. Bring just to a soft boil, and take the pan off 
the heat.
3. Let the mushrooms infuse in the cream for 5 minutes. In a food 
processor, process the mushroom- cream mixture until the sauce 
is quite smooth. For an alternate version, strain out the solids and 
serve as a mushroom- infused cream sauce.
4. Stir in the thyme and parsley, and season with salt and pepper.

POUR OVERMelted cheese and wine has been a part of Swiss 
fare since at least the seventeenth century, but 
it exploded into world consciousness because of the 
marketing efforts of the Swiss Cheese Union (yes, that’s a 
thing) and international fascination with Heidi,  the Swiss 
kids’ book. Fondue etymologically derives from the French 
verb fondre,  “to melt.” Liberties with the sauce have 
accommodated chocolate and fruit compotes, or even just 
oil and fat for steak. For this version, use deliciously dark 
beer like Chimay, or conjure the Alps with an Alpine beer 
like Zermatt Bier. Use whichever cheeses you like, but 
Alpine and soft cheeses work best. Besides those listed, 
consider Comté, Gouda, or Cheddar. Leave extra beer 
and cheese to the side so you can perfect your mixture.
1 tablespoon extra- virgin 
olive oil
½ cup shallots, diced
2 fresh rosemary sprigs
1 whole garlic clove, peeled 
11/3 cups grated Gruyère cheese
1 cup grated Emmental cheese
11/3 cups grated vacherin or 
fontina cheese4½ teaspoons cornstarch
1 cup plus 1 tablespoon brown 
beer, such as Chimay
Juice of 1 lemon
1 tablespoon vin santo or any 
fortified wine, such as port
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Freshly grated nutmeg
1. In a large, heavy- bottomed pan, fondue pot, or cast iron skillet 
over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the shallots, rosemary, and 
garlic clove, and sauté until the shallots turn golden and caramel -
ize, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer everything to a small dish. Strip the 
rosemary, and discard the stems.121
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS EUROPE |2. Smash the garlic clove, and rub the interior of the skillet with 
it, covering the bottom and about an inch up on all sides. Discard 
the garlic.
3. In a large bowl, mix the cheeses together. Add the cornstarch, 
mix, and set aside.
4. In the skillet over medium heat, combine the beer and lemon 
juice and bring to a soft boil. Reduce the heat to low, and add a 
handful of the cheese mixture to the skillet. Stir constantly in 
small circles or figure eights, and as the cheese melts, add another 
handful. Continue until all the cheese is melted.
5. The mixture should be nice and thick, like the consistency of a 
hollandaise or ketchup, so it will stick to bread. This may require a 
little finesse. If it’s too thin, and the cheese just runs off what you 
dip into it, add small handfuls of cheese until it  thickens. If the 
cheese is very clumpy and thick, add a splash of beer.
6. Add the vin santo, and mix. Return to a simmer for 1 minute or 
so. Mix in the shallots and rosemary. Season with salt and pepper. 
Grate some nutmeg over the dish, and serve.
STORAGE:  2 days in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic container, 
but best used immediately
REPURPOSING TIP:  For the best macaroni and cheese of your life, 
 reheat leftover fondue in a saucepan over low heat with a healthy 
dollop of heavy (whipping) cream. Use about a 2- to-1 ratio of fondue to 
cream, but if you’re unsure, just add a little cream, stir, add some more, 
and continue until the sauce is silky.MAINS

SPREA dThe origins of applesauce are murky. Here I’ve 
attributed it to England because of its inclusion in 
several eighteenth century English cookbooks, which 
apparently are the first mentions of the dish. In the 
1739 edition of Compleat Housewife , it accompanied 
duck but has since gone on to become wildly popular 
with all types of game and pork. This recipe is intended 
to be savory, not applesauce as a dessert. However, as an 
offshoot of my mom’s applesauce recipe, it can be eaten 
right out of the jar. Use tart apples like Granny Smith 
and/or McIntosh, or a combination.
4 to 6 apples
Salt
1 cup unfiltered apple 
cider vinegar
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon grated fresh gingerFresh thyme leaves, for 
seasoning
Ground cayenne pepper, for 
seasoning
Freshly ground allspice, for 
seasoning
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Chinois or metal strainer, 
food processor
1. Peel, core, and cube the apples, and set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, combine the apple peels, a pinch of salt, and 
the vinegar. Set aside.123
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS EUROPE |3. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. 
Add the apple cubes, and sauté for 5 minutes. Add the sugar, and 
raise the heat to high. Stir often, being attentive so nothing chars. 
When the apples start to caramelize, strain the vinegar mixture 
into the apple caramel and discard the peels. Let boil for about 
1 minute, and reduce the heat to low.
4. Simmer to reduce the entire mixture for about 15 minutes, until 
the apples are soft and the desired thickness is achieved. Add the 
cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger, and season as you like with thyme, 
cayenne, and allspice.
5. Remove from the heat. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes, then drain, 
saving the liquid. Transfer the apples to the food processor, and 
give a couple of pulses until a mash consistency develops. Add the 
liquid back in as you pulse. It should eventually have small chunks 
of apple hidden among the smoothness of the sauce.
6. Season with salt, then can or refrigerate.
STORAGE:  1 to 2 weeks in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic 
 container, or can this sauce in mason jars to keep for a long time

applesauce in a saucepan until it becomes smooth and thick.MAINS

De Gend, who hails from the Belgian city of Liège. 
This sauce gets an abundance of flavor from a glaze 
called sirop de Liège , which is made by boiling down 
apple and pear juices into a syrup. The sauce is used to 
cook  boulets à la liégeoise  (meatballs in Liège sauce, 
traditionally served with fries and mayonnaise) but can 
be used for all sorts of gamey meats and poultry, like 
rabbit, boar, or turkey. Some places in Belgium give you 
the option to top your fries with sauce Liégeoise, but those 
of us who like our fries crispy love having it on the side 
for dipping, especially with mayonnaise. Since 1996 there 
has been a competition to award a Crystal Meatball 
(Le Boulet de Cristal)  to the best maker of the dish.
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon butter
1 large onion, chopped

 EUROPE |PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS
1. In a large cast iron skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat, heat 
the oil and butter. When the foam subsides, add the onion and 
stir until golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and 2 teaspoons of 
sirop de Liège. Stir well for about 5 minutes and let it caramelize.
2. Add the vinegar slowly into the mix and deglaze the pan, scrap -
ing up any browned bits from the bottom. Allow to boil down for 
5 minutes, then sprinkle the flour onto the mixture while stirring. 
Pour the stock in slowly to blend it in. Add the beer, cloves, thyme, 
bay leaves, mustard, and the remaining 3 teaspoons of sirop. Stir 
well. If cooking protein or meat, add it here.
3. Bring to a gentle boil. Cover partially, and simmer on low for 
an hour, stirring occasionally. Remove the lid, stir well, and add 
the currants. Simmer uncovered for 20 more minutes, or until it 
reaches desired smoothness. It should be silky thick.
4. Season with salt and pepper.
STORAGE:  2 weeks in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic container, 
or 4 months in the freezer; freeze it as you would a soup, in a plastic 
container or silicone reusable freezer bag that can be boiled
INGREDIENT TIP:  Order sirop de Liège online. Meurens is the best- 
known brand.
REPURPOSING TIP:  To use this as a cook- in sauce, brown and pan 
sear 1 pound of meatballs or cubed beef, rabbit, lamb, or poultry in oil.

CONd IMENTGrüne Soße  is a mix of seven fresh herbs with a 
dose of cream. Ben Pommer, Head of Culinary 
at BRLO BRWHOUSE in Berlin, taught me his old 
Grüne Soße recipe. The sauce is in the same extended 
family of green sauces as salsa verde, chimichurri, and 
gremolata, but with added sour cream, yogurt, and, in 
Chef Pommer’s recipe, mustard. Using cream in pesto 
is a sin in Genovese households (like my mom’s), so I 
cheat by using Grüne Soße when I’m keen for something 
creamy and herbal. Generally used with boiled veggies, 
potatoes, and hard-boiled eggs, this sauce is adaptable. 
Not all the traditional herbs listed here are easily found 
outside of Germany, so just substitute herbs that are 
available to you.
5 cups (about 1/3 pound total) 
assorted herbs, stemmed 
and cleaned (pick seven from 
among chives, chervil, curly- 
leaf parsley, sorrel, borage, 
garden cress, tarragon, lemon

CONd IMENTSenfsauce  is a Bavarian mustard sauce commonly 
served over boiled eggs and root vegetables. Eier 
mit Senfsauce — eggs with mustard sauce— became 
a cornerstone of German cuisine in the nineteenth 
century. The base is a simple hollandaise of butter, 
lemon juice, vinegar, and egg yolks, with all manner of 
savory additions. Pair it with fish such as smoked salmon, 
winter vegetables like broccoli or cauliflower, poultry, or 
potatoes. Berlin resident Zach Johnston grew up with this 
sauce and learned it from his mom, who learned it from 
her German grandmother.
1 cup vegetable or chicken 
stock (page xv; optional)
1 teaspoon cornstarch 
dissolved in 1½ teaspoons 
water (optional, with 
the stock)
½ pound unsalted butter
Juice of ½ lemon
¼ teaspoon apple cider vinegar
4 large egg yolks
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
¼ teaspoon ground allspice¼ teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon creamy horseradish
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon pickled 
mustard seeds
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
SPECIAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED
Double boiler or a stainless 
steel mixing bowl set 
over a pot
1. If using stock, gently boil it in a saucepan over medium heat 
until it reduces to ½ cup, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix in the cornstarch 
until it thickens to a semi- gelatinous consistency. Set aside.129
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS EUROPE |2. Clarify the butter by heating it in a small skillet over low heat. 
Skim off the white residue as it arrives at a simmer, until the butter 
is golden and clear, about 5 minutes. Let cool.
3. Make a simple hollandaise in a double boiler or by bringing 
a pot of water to a low simmer and placing a stainless steel bowl 
over it. Add the lemon juice and apple cider vinegar to the bowl, 
then add the egg yolks while whisking constantly. Continue whisk -
ing, and gradually add the warm clarified butter until the mixture 
becomes thick. If the emulsion breaks, add another egg yolk and 
mix it again.
4. Add the nutmeg, allspice, paprika, horseradish, mustard, mus -
tard seeds, and stock mixture (if using) as you continually whisk, 
and season with salt and pepper.

MIX INThere are two versions of Rødgrød— a dessert 
and a meat sauce. My Danish accomplice, Ole 
Storm Hansen, recalls eating the dessert version in 
his grandmother’s allotment hut on the outskirts of 
Copenhagen near the airport during midsummers. In 
1655, the Danish king commanded that small gardens 
be provided on the outskirts of town to help the poor 
grow their own greens and fruits. Later, in the 1800s, the 
city’s working class used them for the same purpose; 
the oldest hut still standing traces back to 1821. When I 
make either version of Rødgrød while barbecuing in my 
sunny backyard, I’m transported to that Scandinavian 
countryside paradise, with 747s disrupting the potato 
gardens. This is the savory version.
2/3 cup sugar
1 cup apple cider vinegar or a 
tart/sour beer like Mikellers
¾ cup light or fruity beer
1 pound (about 2½ to 3 cups) 
mixed fresh or thawed 
forest berries (blackberries, 
strawberries, raspberries)
2 teaspoons chopped 
fresh thyme2 tablespoons potato flour
5 tablespoons water
½ cup lightly whipped 
cream (optional; omit for 
Dairy Free / Vegan)
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1. Start by making a gastrik . In a large saucepan over medium-  low 
heat, heat the sugar just until it starts to caramelize. Do not let 
it burn or get too dark. Gently pour the vinegar over the sugar. 
Do not put your face over the pan as you mix in the liquid , as it 
could pop and burn.131
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS EUROPE |2. Do not stir the pot, but allow the liquid to reduce to a thin syrup 
over medium-  low heat, 5 to 10 minutes. The sugar may harden 
but will eventually reconstitute into a liquid. Add the fruity beer 
when the sugar is mostly dissolved (it will help dissolve the rest of 
the sugar) and cook down for another 10 to 15 minutes. Pour the 
mixture into a dish and set aside to cool; you should have about 
a cup of syrup.
3. When cool, in a large pot, combine the gastrik and beer mixture 
and the berries and let sit for 1 hour.
4. Add the thyme, and heat the mixture on low for about 1 hour. 
The foam should dissipate as it cooks. If it doesn’t, cook a little 
longer until it does. Take the pot off the heat.
5. In a small bowl, combine the flour and water. As soon as the fruit 
stops bubbling after you take it off the heat, gently add the flour 
and water (it is very important that the fruit is not boiling when 
you do this, or the flour will clump), slowly pouring and mixing 
until a silky lind (silky smooth) texture is formed. Stir in the cream 
(if using).
6. Season with salt and pepper. Pour into a serving bowl and let 
cool a bit. Serve warm.
STORAGE:  2 weeks in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic  container, 
3 months in the freezer; use small plastic containers and freeze in 
portion sizes
REPURPOSING TIP:  To make the dessert version, instead of the gastrik, 
use 2 cups of elderflower syrup or a liquid sweetener of your choice. 
Mix the fruit with the syrup and let sit for 1 hour. Then cook over low 
heat and simmer until the foam dissipates. Take the pot off the heat, 
then add the combined potato flour and water, and stir until the con -
sistency thickens. Pour into a serving bowl, sprinkle with sugar, and let 
cool. Serve with whipped cream.MAINS

SPREA dIn Sweden, winter is Lingonsås  season. This recipe 
comes from Ole Storm Hansen’s Swedish mother, 
who associates it with hunting season. Landowners in 
Sweden used to receive a jaktkort  (quota) to cull the 
moose herd, based on how much land they owned. If one 
farmer had a license for 1.3 moose, and their neighbor 
had one for 0.7 moose, they could combine them to kill 
two moose and split the meat proportionally. Lingonsås is 
one of the traditional sauces to pair with cooked moose. 
The lingonberry is a cousin of the cranberry and red 
currant. You can substitute either to make this delicious 
sauce. Use it as a jam for morning toast and pastries. 
And of course, ditch the canned Thanksgiving cranberry 
sauce and make this instead.
2/3 cup sugar
1 cup apple cider vinegar or 
tart/sour beer like Mikellers
1/3 cup veal or stock of choice 
(page xv)
6 to 8 dried bay leaves
1 tablespoon dry thyme or  
1 handful fresh thyme
1 pound (about 2 to 3 cups) 
fresh lingonberries, 
cranberries, or red currants 
(or frozen and thawed;

medium-  low heat for 40 minutes.
4. Pour all of the gastrik over the fruit. Season with salt and 
pepper. In a separate medium bowl, mix the flour in the water until 
dissolved. Set aside.
5. Mix the cream into the berry mixture gently, followed by half 
of the flour and water mixture. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, until the 
sauce develops a syrupy consistency. Ideally, when you take a 
spoonful and turn it upside down, some of the sauce remains on 
the spoon but most drips off. If you need more of the flour mixture 
to achieve this, mix in the other half and stir for 2 to 5 minutes.

MIX INHorseradish sauce is a Scandinavian mainstay. 
This recipe comes from Lisa Karlsson in Norrköping, 
Sweden. However, similar ingredients and regionally 
diverse preparations are found in Norway’s pepparot 
saus , Denmark’s peberrodssovs , and Finland’s 
piparjuurikastiketta . Horseradish is a classic ingredient 
in a Swedish smorgasbord. This sauce is ideal for fish, 
especially of the cured or smoked variety. From there, 
use your imagination. Pot roasts, any kind of potatoes, 
red meat, pork, and eggs are all complemented by the 
sharpness of the horseradish— which in turn is mulled 
by the smoothness of the crème fraîche. Pepparrotsås is 
the perfect spread for a roast beef sandwich, or add to 
ketchup to make a cocktail sauce.
1 cup créme fraîche (see 
Ingredient tip)
½ cup heavy (whipping) cream, 
thick whipped
2 teaspoons grated 
fresh horseradish (see 
Ingredient tip)1 teaspoon freshly squeezed 
lemon juice
½ teaspoon honey 
Freshly ground black pepper
Flake salt135
PAIRINGS AND  
SERVING IDEAS EUROPE |1. In a large bowl, mix together the crème fraîche, cream, 
 horseradish, lemon juice, and honey. Let stand for 20 minutes.
2. Add pepper and flake salt to taste and serve.
STORAGE:  4 days in the refrigerator in a glass jar or plastic container; 
it will get smoother by the day
INGREDIENT TIP:  Make homemade crème fraîche by combining 1 cup 
heavy (whipping) cream and 2 tablespoons buttermilk (or sour cream 
in a pinch) in a jar, screw on the lid, and let sit for 12 to 18 hours at 
room temperature. Refrigerate until needed.
INGREDIENT TIP:  Freshly grated horseradish is always best, but in case 
of emergency, prepared horseradish in a jar or tube will suffice. It is 
generally half as strong as fresh and significantly less bright.
REPURPOSING TIP:  If serving the sauce with salad or cold meat 
(like roast beef), add 1 minced Royal Gala or green apple. If the sauce 
is to be served with hot meat or fish, add one small finely chopped 
 garlic clove.MAINS

you can pair your newfound favorite far- flung sauce 
recipes with everyday dishes and meals. Y ou’ll find 
simple recipes for meat, poultry, seafood, vegetables, legumes, 
beans, and grains. For each base recipe, you’ll find a suggested 
sauce or two. Also, every single sauce in the book is paired with 
one of the recipes in this part, so theoretically you could work 
your way through this section’s suggestions and make every 
sauce in the book. But hopefully by now, you feel empowered 
to experiment, explore, and mix and match—  choose your own 
escapade, so to speak.
This section is also the perfect resource when you’re looking 
to repurpose leftover sauces. Running home from work with the 
knowledge that you have leftover Pesto della Zia in the fridge? 
Y ou can use it with nearly any of the following base recipes. 
Combine it with some rice or pasta and veggies, and you’ll have 
an entire delicious meal with extremely minimal effort. Since 
the recipes in this section were carefully chosen based on both 
versatility and reusability, this process can be replicated with 
practically every sauce in the book.

SERVES 4One of our sins as home cooks is overthinking 
steak. I’ve made hundreds of steaks over wood 
fire coals, and this is still my favorite way to do it. 
My parrilla partner Jake Williams and I keep it 
simple by selecting what’s known in Argentina as la 
entraña — skirt steak. It’s thin so it cooks quickly, and 
it isn’t too expensive. Also, it’s fatty and flavorful. 
Let sauces like Muhammara (page 78), Chimichurri 
(page 66), and Monkey Gland Sauce (page 102) do 
the heavy lifting. The meat tastes great on its own.
2 (1- pound) skirt steaks
2 tablespoons coarse- grain 
sea salt
2 tablespoons freshly 
ground black pepperSeveral pinches crushed red 
pepper flakes
1 tablespoon clarified butter
1 sauce recipe
1. Season the steaks before cooking by heaping generous

wood charcoals fiery hot, so the butter singes on the grate, 
then quickly paint the butter onto the grill. If you’re cooking 
on a stovetop, heat the butter in a large cast iron skillet over 
high heat until it shimmers.
3. Quickly after buttering the grill or pan, throw on the steaks 
(you should hear an immediate sizzle) for 3 to 5 minutes, 
until the bottom is starting to char. Flip and sear on the 
opposite side for 1 to 2 minutes, until both sides have some 
char but the meat is pink in the middle. Remove from the

SERVES 4Thin- cut pork chops don’t take long to cook, and 
the pork doesn’t tend to dry out, as it does with 
thicker cuts. This is also an exceptional selection 
if you’re on the go— one of the quickest and easiest 
recipes here. Pair with rice and serve with a side 
of Tonkatsu (page 18), Rødgrød (page 130), or the 
classic accompaniment, Apple Gastrique (page 122).

SERVES 4Scaloppini is the perfect weeknight main dish, 
because pounding the turkey thin means it will 
cook rather rapidly on the stovetop. You’ll need to 
cook in batches, since pounding the turkey expands 
it beyond the range of most skillets. To pound, put the 
turkey between two pieces of kitchen parchment or 
plastic wrap and whack it with a kitchen mallet.

TO MARINATE 
(FOR PONZU)
COOK TIME:   
10 MINUTES
SERVES 4Duck breast is divine. It has flavorful skin that, 
when properly crisped, is pleasantly resistant, 
adding an immaculate texture to the duck. Duck 
can be juicy, lush, or gamey, so I tend to lean toward 
forthright sauces. Try a drizzle of Ponzu (page 16), 
or for a hearty accompaniment, use Satay (page 28). 
Cooking in Sauce Liégeoise (page 124) is certainly 
recommended here.
4 duck breasts, skin on
1 teaspoon sea salt
¼ teaspoon freshly ground 
black pepper2 tablespoons extra- virgin 
olive oil
1 sauce recipe
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
2. Using a sharp knife, score the skin side of the duck breast 
in a crisscross pattern, cutting down to the meat but not 
through it. Season the duck breast with the salt and pepper 
(no salt if using Ponzu).
3. If using Ponzu, place the duck breast skin- side up in a large 
baking dish, pour on half of the Ponzu, reserving the rest, and 
marinate for 20 minutes. Remove from the Ponzu and pat dry. 
Omit the salt. Discard the marinade.151 MEAT AN d P OULTRY |4. For all sauces, in a large skillet over medium-  high heat, 
heat the olive oil until it shimmers. Add the duck breasts, 
skin- side down, and cook until the fat is rendered and 
the skin is brown, about 6 minutes. Remove all but about 
2 tablespoons of the rendered fat, and flip the duck breasts. 
(You can use the fat to cook something else, such as potatoes 
or vegetables, because it is very flavorful.) Cook the duck 
breast skin- side up until it reaches an internal temperature of 
135°F (medium rare), about 4 minutes. Remove from the pan 
and set aside, tented with foil to keep warm.
PONZU (PAGE 16):  Add the reserved Ponzu to the pan, using the 
side of a spoon to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits 
from the bottom. Bring to a simmer, and simmer for 1 minute.

to the pan. Simmer for 1 minute. Turn the duck once, and simmer 
for 30 seconds more. Serve with the warmed Ponzu as a dip -
ping sauce.
SATAY (PAGE 28) OR SAUCE LIÉGEOISE (PAGE 124):  Either pre -

Wild Salmon Four Ways
Wild Salmon is a simple, healthy fish to serve with sauces because it 
can be cooked in so many ways (farmed salmon can have colorants 
and carcinogens). Generally, most of the sauces in this book can be poured 
or spread over your cooked salmon; with others, you may have to coat the 
fish with the sauce while it cooks. Sauces that go well with salmon include 
Tomatillo Salsa Verde (page 58), Huckleberry Sauce (page 40), 
Pepparrotsås (page 134), and Sauvignon Blanc Cream Sauce (page 34).

White Fish Four Ways
White fish is delicate and flaky with a light flavor, so it needs subtle 
sauces that do not overpower it. Because different white fishes are 
available regionally, it’s best to look for sustainable fish such as (at the time 
of writing) silver hake, Pacific halibut, sardines, branzino, Atlantic mackerel, 
many types of trout, char, or barramundi. Cooking times, temperatures, and 
methods vary depending on the fish size, but working with fillets is pretty 
standard, so choose whichever of these fish and sauces will work best for you. 
Suggestions are Yellow Kroeung (page 24), Guasacaca (page 60), Salsa 
Vizcaína (page 114), and Chermoula Rouge (page 90).

SERVES 4Mussels have made my heart sing as my favorite 
seafood since I was tall enough to see over the 
counter at my Nonna’s. I usually cook mussels on the 
parrilla with their shells on, but this is her method. 
It is tried and true. For a sauces book, it has the 
added advantage of making tiny spoons out of the 
shells, since she removes half— perfect for lopping up 
dipping sauces. Piri Piri Whiskey Sauce (page 118) 
is great on any shellfish, but especially mussels 
because it’ll get in all the nooks and crannies of the 
shellfish.
3 pounds mussels,

¼ cup extra- virgin olive oil
4 garlic cloves,

don’t open. Remove from the heat, and remove the top shell 
from each.163 SEAFOOd  |2. In a large skillet over low heat, melt the butter and heat

PREP TIME:

COOK TIME:   
10 MINUTES
SERVES 4In Louisiana we have two weather seasons and 
four shellfish seasons: Oyster, crawfish, crab 
and, of course, shrimp. Gulf shrimp are juicy, puffy, 
and delicious. Nearly everyone in the state can 
pontificate on how their recipe or method is the best 
for shrimp, and I believe every one of them. This is 
a basic recipe that’ll allow the flavor of the shrimp 
to shine through and not complicate things, so get 
high- quality shrimp if you can. While Filipino Adobo 
(page 32) is generally used for chicken, the family 
recipe in this book is tailored for shrimp, as is the 
Salsa de Mani (page 62) recipe.
1 pound medium shrimp
½ teaspoon sea salt
¼ teaspoon freshly ground 
black pepper2 tablespoons extra- virgin 
olive oil or unsalted butter
Juice of 1 lemon

Pan-Seared Sea Scallops
PREP TIME:   
5 MINUTES
COOK TIME:

SERVES 4Scallops are like the candy of the sea. They can 
be sweet, salty, succulent, and fatty. They are 
a remarkable conduit for drizzled sweet sauces, 
because of their buttery, savory composition. Yet, for 
herbal or spicy sauces, they can be oily enough to 
stand up to the spice. Best of all, they are quick and 
easy, making them a perfect appetizer while you’re 
preparing other sauces. In that respect, Nam Jim 
(page 26) is an ideal match because of its tartness, 
and it can be made a day or two ahead of time.
1 pound sea scallops
Sea salt
Freshly ground black pepper2 tablespoons canola oil or 
unsalted butter
1 sauce recipe
1. Using a sharp knife, trim each scallop to remove the tendon 
that connects it to the shell. Season your scallops with salt 
and pepper.
2. In a large skillet over medium-  high heat, heat the oil or 
butter until it shimmers (oil) or bubbles (butter). Add the 
scallops to the hot fat. Cook until browned on one side, about 
2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 
2 to 3 minutes more.
3. Using tongs, remove the scallops from the hot fat and set 
them aside on a platter tented with aluminum foil to keep warm.
NAM JIM (PAGE 26):  Drizzle some of the sauce over the scallops, 
and set the rest on the side for dipping.

option as well. My absolute favorite stir- fry sauce is 
Black Bean Sauce (page 14). Harissa Verte (page 92) 
can either be added to that or stand alone. My 
culinary compass points toward Nam Jim (page 26) 
for its tartness, so go with what you feel— even if it’s 
all three.
1 eggplant, peeled and cut 
into ½- inch pieces
1 teaspoon sea salt
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 yellow onion, 
roughly chopped
2 carrots, peeled and 
roughly chopped4 ounces shiitake or cremini 
mushrooms, quartered
6 asparagus stalks, chopped
¼ teaspoon freshly ground 
black pepper
2 tablespoons Black Bean 
Sauce (page 14) or Harissa 
Verte (page 92) or ¼ cup 
Nam Jim (page 26)
1. In a colander over a bowl, toss the eggplant with the salt. 
Let rest for 20 minutes for the liquid to come out of the 
eggplant. Rinse away the salt, and pat dry.
2. In a large, nonstick pan or wok over medium-  high heat, 
heat the oil until it shimmers. Add the onion, carrots, 
 mushrooms, and asparagus, and cook, stirring, until just 
before they are crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.

Mixed Green Salad
PREP TIME:   
15 MINUTES
COOK TIME:   
2 MINUTES 
(OPTIONAL)
SERVES 4Catalogued here is the most delightful green 
salad I’ve ever had, and I ask for it every time 
I go back home to Maine. I begged and pleaded with 
its curator, Lori Austin, to hand it over. She makes 
it with a simple spicy mustard and maple syrup 
dressing. Try Pomegranate-Beet Raita (page 6) or 
thinned Tkemali (page 74) over it, or Hummus bi 
Tahina (page 86) alongside it.
4 cups organic spring 
mix (lettuce, spinach, 
etc.), torn
2 cups mâche rosette, 
endive, pea shoots, or any 
specialty leaf, split or torn
1 handful fresh dill, chopped
½ cup halved grapes
½ cup chopped bell pepper1 tablespoon apple 
cider vinegar
2 tablespoons pecans 
(optional)
2 tablespoons extra- virgin 
olive oil
½ avocado, sliced
3 tablespoons sauce
1. In a large bowl, combine the spring mix, specialty leaf 
mix, dill, grapes, and bell pepper. Toss with the apple 
cider vinegar.
2. If using the pecans, lightly toast in a small, dry pan over 
low heat for 1 to 2 minutes, and add to the salad.
3. Slowly pour on the oil in a thin stream, and top with the 
avocado slices.

Pan-Roasted Veggies
PREP TIME:   
10 MINUTES
COOK TIME:   
40 MINUTES
SERVES 4Pan-Roasted Veggies have a deep, rich flavor that 
comes from the caramelization of the veggies 
as they cook on high heat. They make a delicious 
side dish or a main. Toss the hot vegetables with 
Senfsauce (page 128) or Romesco (page 112). If 
you’re feeling saucy, dip them in Fondue à la Bière 
(page 120).
1 sweet potato, peeled and 
cut into 1- inch cubes
12 Brussels sprouts, halved
1 red bell pepper, seeds and 
ribs removed, cut into 
1- inch pieces
4 shallots, peeled and 
quartered2 tablespoons extra- virgin

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
2. In a large bowl, toss the sweet potato, Brussels sprouts, bell 
pepper, shallots, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread out on two 
rimmed baking sheets.
3. Roast until the vegetables are soft and browned, 
30 to 40 minutes, rotating pans (switching racks) halfway

Bell Pepper Egg Boats
PREP TIME:   
5 MINUTES
COOK TIME:   
30 MINUTES
SERVES 4 TO 8Marrón con huevo  is a common sight at 
Argentine parrilladas, which is where I learned 
the trick from dear friends in Buenos Aires, Guille 
Maya and Delfina Mansilla. I call them Bell Pepper 
Egg Boats because that’s what they basically look 
like. They’re probably the most popular base at the 
backyard parrilladas, likely because they are such 
a good vehicle for holding sauces, bits of bacon, 
cheese, or anything. Try them with Jajik (page 80), 
Mojito (page 52), or Chimichurri (page 66)— or any 
other sauce that has become your favorite.
4 bell peppers, any color
Extra- virgin olive oil, for 
oiling the skillet
8 large eggs
1 small (4-  ounce) block goat 
cheese, room temperature, 
cut into 8 piecesSalt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 sauce recipe
1. Halve each bell pepper lengthwise, cutting down straight 
through the top to create two perfectly even “boats.” Carefully 
remove the seeds and ribs without piercing or breaching 
the flesh.173 VEGETABLES |2. Place the peppers face down (so the boat is upside down) 
on a large, barely oiled skillet over medium-  high heat, and 
roast until the inside edges of the peppers start to char, 
5 to 10 minutes.
3. Flip over the boats, and crack one egg into each; the 
yolk should remain intact. Cook the boats (covered, if 
needed) until the egg whites are cooked though and opaque, 
15 to 20 minutes. Ideally, the yolks will remain runny.
4. Top each with a piece of goat cheese, and season with salt 
and pepper. Leave on the heat 1 minute more to slightly melt 
the cheese.

Hand-Cut Zucchini Noodles
PREP TIME:   
15 MINUTES
COOK TIME:   
5 MINUTES
SERVES 4Zucchini noodles make a harmonious alternative 
to pasta, and you don’t need to have a spiralizer 
to make your own. All you need is a vegetable peeler 
and a sharp knife. They are an excellent side dish, 
topped with excessively flavorful sauces. Think 
Romesco (page 112), Grüne Soße (page 126), or 
Tomato “Simba Kali” Sauce (page 100).
4 medium zucchini
2 tablespoons extra- virgin 
olive oil
Pinch crushed red 
pepper flakes
½ teaspoon sea salt¼ teaspoon freshly ground 
black pepper
1 garlic clove, minced
1 sauce recipe
1. Using a vegetable peeler, cut the zucchini into strips. 
Then use a sharp knife to cut the strips into half- inch-  wide 
noodles. You can stack the strips and cut through several 
at once to make cutting go more quickly.
2. In a large skillet over medium-  high heat, heat the olive oil 
until it shimmers. Add the zucchini, red pepper flakes, salt, 
and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the zucchini is 
crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds.

Fluffy Couscous
PREP TIME:   
15 MINUTES
COOK TIME:   
15 MINUTES
SERVES 4Hot couscous is a dreamy main course medium. 
It’s also an ideal cold salad base paired with 
veggies or mixed with a sauce. Because of the tiny 
size of the pasta used in couscous, it’s astonishingly 
quick to cook, so using it as a dish when you’re in a 
hurry is still fairly tranquil and unrushed. Combine 
couscous with a dollop of Haydari (page 76), Cacik 
(page 76), or Pomegranate-Beet Raita (page 6) as 
a cold salad, or serve warm with Baba Ghanoush 
(page 84) or Filfel Chuma (page 88).

PLUS 10 MINUTES 
TO REST
COOK TIME:   
3 MINUTES
SERVES 6Amazing and fresh noodles are fairly easy to make, 
and I use this recipe from my colleague Alex 
Bonner. With a pasta roller, you can cut and form them 
into a variety of shapes and lengths to accompany 
sauces from all over the world. Ragù della Nonna (wide 
pappardelle, page 108) or Pesto della Zia (trofie, a short 
twist, page 110) are my family’s classic combinations. But 
hand- cut noodles also work as cold noodle salads with 
Chef Nini’s Nuoc Mam Cham (angel hair pasta, page 22) 
or Satay (spaghetti, page 28). For those without a pasta 
roller, 1 pound of fresh pasta bought from the store will 
feed about four people.

55 MINUTES
SERVES 4Wild rice takes a while to cook, but it keeps in 
the refrigerator, so you can cook it ahead of 
time to save time and reheat when you’re in a hurry 
on a weeknight. Combined with black beans, it’s a 
harmonious, light meal with salsa or sauces like Pebre 
(page 64), Green Chile “Chacon” (page 48), or Jajik 
(page 80) to give it a dynamic creamy layer.
2 tablespoons canola oil

finely ground flour. In a pinch you can try using your 
leftover taters from Smashed Garlic Red Potatoes 
(page 176) or Roasted Fingerling Potatoes (page 177). 
These gnocchi taste like little cloud pillows, so

1. In a large bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, egg, and 
salt. Mix well.
2. Add the flour to the bowl ¼ cup at a time, and mix each 
addition with your hands until just combined. Sprinkle a little 
flour onto a baking mat, pastry cloth, or cutting board. Break 
the dough into four pieces.
3. Roll each piece of dough in the flour (to prevent sticking) 
and then into a long log or rope about half an inch thick. 
Cut each rope into half- inch-  long pieces.
4. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and add a pinch of salt. 
Add the gnocchi to the boiling water, and stir once. Cook 
until the gnocchi float to the top, about 3 minutes. Drain in

The Dirty Dozen  
and the Clean Fifteen™
A nonprofit environmental watchdog organization called Environmental 
Working Group (EWG) looks at data supplied by the US Department of Agri -
culture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about pesticide 
residues. Each year it compiles a list of the best and worst pesticide loads 
found in commercial crops. You can use these lists to decide which fruits and 
vegetables to buy organic to minimize your exposure to pesticides and which 
produce is considered safe enough to buy conventionally. This does not mean 
they are pesticide-free, though, so wash these fruits and vegetables thoroughly. 
The list is updated annually, and you can find it online at EWG.org/FoodNews.
DIRTY DOZEN™
1. strawberries
2. spinach
3. kale
4. nectarines5. apples
6. grapes
7. peaches
8. cherries9. pears
10. tomatoes
11. celery
12. potatoes
†Additionally, nearly three-quarters of hot pepper samples contained pesticide residues.
CLEAN FIFTEEN™

* A small amount of sweet corn, papaya, and summer squash sold in the United States is produced  
 from genetically modified seeds. Buy organic varieties of these crops if you want to avoid genetically modified 
produce.198
