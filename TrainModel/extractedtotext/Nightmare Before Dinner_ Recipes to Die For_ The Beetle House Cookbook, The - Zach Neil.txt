TextIntroduction
This Is Halloween
First off, thank you so much for buying this book. No matter who you are or where you 
are, you have made a difference in my life and made one of my dreams possible. Always believe in yourself and be positive. That is how this book became a reality. 
Once upon a time, I was a child from a tiny town, brought up with very humble 
means. Raised in a religious family that didn’t allow the celebration of Halloween, I dreamed of that amazing day when people dress up, express themselves, and, of course, get tricked or treated! To me, the excitement, fright, and fun of Halloween was only a dream, as it was forbidden to me. When I finally reached the age when I could make my own decision about celebrating Halloween, I exposed myself to movies, music, and other art that inspired me, changed my life, and, of course, made me want to open a place where Halloween was celebrated every day. That place now exists, and it’s called Beetle House.
As a child, I loved to cook, and my love for food has never waned. During my years 
as a young musician, I cooked in restaurants to pay the bills when I wasn’t on tour. I worked with my closest friends, favorite chefs, and mixologists to craft and create the dishes at my restaurants that not only pay tribute to autumn, my favorite time of year, but also conjure up visions of autumn in the Northeastern United States. The flavors remind me of the change in seasons, good times spent with loved ones, and feasting on stick-to-your-guts, hearty comfort foods. The best part about this odyssey is that I became more interested in plant-based and healthy eating, and was able to craft a vegan alternative for almost every dish on the menu, as well as some perfectly delicious stand-alone vegan dishes. This book is the culmination of my passions.
Enjoy this book, try every recipe, come visit me at one of the Beetle House locations, 
and most importantly, express yourself every day as if it were Halloween. Be your most authentic self, wear what you want, be who you want—every day is Halloween!

can keep it dark and plant-based, too. Believe me: Even if you don’t have a 
Whole Foods, T rader Joe’s, or other artisanal grocery on your block, if you 
have an internet connection, you can veganize anything!

TextLove It Sauce
Prep Time: 5 minutes  |  Cook time: 7 –10 minutes / Yield: 4 cups (900 g)
Love It Sauce is a play on a basic Alfredo sauce, and it’s very easy to make. Use 
it for a variety of dishes, including pasta, chicken, beans, and even risotto. I 
also frankenstein it up to be the main sauce for the Love It Pot Pie (page 78). 
Deadly Ingredients
2 cups (475 ml) heavy whipping cream
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh 
  rosemary
1⁄4 teaspoon crushed garlic 
  or garlic paste  
1 teaspoon dried parsley2 cups (200 g) finely grated 
  Romano cheese, such as Locatelli
1 tablespoon cream cheese1 tablespoon butter, softened 
  (optional, see Tip)
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 
  (optional, see Tip)
whole milk or cream 
 (optional, see Tip)To Make It
1.  Pour the cream into a medium saucepan. Add the rosemary, 
garlic, and parsley. Reduce heat, continue to cook for 3 to 5 
minutes, whisking constantly. Heat the mixture on medium until it starts to slowly boil. 
2.  Reduce the heat to low–medium. While whisking constantly, 
gradually add the Romano cheese. Continue to whisk until the cheese melts and blends into the cream, and the sauce becomes smooth. 
3.  Add the cream cheese and whisk until blended. If needed, adjust 
the thickness of sauce (see Tip).
4.  Once the sauce has achieved the desired consistency, remove it 
from the heat. You’re done!
TIP  If the sauce is too thin, mix together 1 tablespoon softened butter and 1 tablespoon flour to make a roux. 
Then briskly whisk the roux into the sauce until it thickens. If your sauce is too thick, slowly whisk in a little bit 
(1 tablespoon at a time) of whole milk or more cream.

TextEdward Sauce
Prep Time: 10 minutes  |  Yield: 4 cups (900 g)
As the name implies, this sauce is used on our famous Edward Burger Hands (page 62) 
dish at Beetle House, but this cream-based sriracha sauce is also perfect for dipping 
French fries and spreading on sandwiches, particularly chicken or burgers. Just like 
Edward, though, this sauce is too good to last in our world. Make a jar, and Edward 
Sauce will last for 3 to 4 weeks in the refrigerator.
Deadly Ingredients
2 cups (460 g) sour cream 
2 cups (450 g) mayonnaise 2 tablespoons sugar 
1⁄2 tablespoon salt
1⁄2 tablespoon garlic powder

1 tablespoon chipotle- 
  cinnamon spice rub,   such as Lawry’sTo Make It
1.  Place all the ingredients in a bowl and whisk the shit 
out of them. Your finished sauce should have the 
consistency of mayonnaise.
GO VEGAN!  Use vegan sour cream instead of sour 
cream, and vegan mayo instead of mayonnaise.

TextSweet Lime Cream Sauce
Prep Time: 10 minutes  |  Yield: 21⁄2 cups (375 g)

TextVeruca Sauce
Prep Time: 10 minutes  |  Cook time: 5 minutes  |  Yield: 3⁄4 cup (180 ml)
Just like Veruca herself, this sauce has everything—a rich, buttery honey 
taste with a smack of sweet, salt, and garlic all in one! Use it to coat 
wings, brush over chicken or fish, or douse on anything else you want to 
give a rich indulgent taste!
Deadly Ingredients
1⁄2 cup (1 stick or 112 g) 
  butter, melted
1⁄4 cup (60 ml) chicken stock 
1 teaspoon crushed garlic 
  or garlic paste
2 teaspoons honey Salt, to tasteTo Make It
1.  Mix all ingredients in a small saucepan. Heat on 
medium for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring frequently 
until the butter starts to boil and brown. 
2.  Remove from the heat and stir.

stock, and agave nectar instead of honey.

Prep Time: 10 minutes  |  Yield: 11⁄4 cups (300 g)
The Beetle House’s Hollow Sauce—also called Gochujang Glaze—is a combination of 
homemade ketchup and gochujang, which is a Korean fermented chili paste. It’s great 
on chicken, fish, and shellfish, and we use it on our Shrimpy Hollow dish (page 80).
Deadly Ingredients

  (recipe below) 
1⁄2 cup (125 g) gochujang
Homemade Ketchup

TextDead Sauce
Prep Time: 10 minutes  |  Cook time: 5 minutes  |  Yield: 11⁄4 cups (285 g)
This super-tasty citrus sauce is spicy, sweet, and garlicky. I use it for our Evil Dead 
Shrimp (page 83), but it also works in a variety of other dishes. Put it in a squeeze bottle 
and drizzle it over seafood, chicken, or even rice or pasta, and anything else you like. 
Deadly Ingredients
1⁄2 cup (1 stick or 112 g) butter, melted 
2 tablespoons honey 
1 teaspoon crushed garlic 
  or garlic paste

1⁄4 cup (60 ml) lime juice
1⁄4 cup (60 g) sour cream 
1⁄4 cup (60 g) mayonnaise 
1⁄2 teaspoon sriracha sauce To Make It
1.  Combine the butter, honey, garlic, and salt in a small frying 
pan. Heat on low until the butter melts and begins to bubble. 
Allow the garlic to turn golden, but do not overcook. Heat until you get a strong scent of the garlic and butter. 
2.  Remove the butter mixture from the heat and allow to cool 
to near room temperature, about 15 minutes. 
3.  Add the butter mixture and the remaining ingredients to a 
food processor, and process until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. 
4.  Store the sauce in the refrigerator.
Tip  This sauce is best served at room temperature, so remove it from the refrigerator well before your meal.
GO VEGAN!  Use vegan butter, vegan sour cream, vegan mayo, and agave nectar.

TextBrains & Chips
Prep Time: 15 minutes  |  Yield: 6 servings
Cilantro is disgusting! (Okay, if you don’t agree with me, that’s all right. However, you 
won’t find it in any recipe I create, because I hate it.) So, for this guacamole, you may 
add it, but I would prefer you didn’t. Created for Beetle House NYC, Brains & Chips 
has been one of our top sellers for the past two years. Serve it in a small bowl or mug. 
Stick the chips around the edges of the bowl, leaving the center open to garnish with 
a dash of paprika . . . or some fresh cilantro (if you want to ruin everyone’s day). 
Deadly Ingredients
Chips
4 moderately ripe plantains 
  (firm, not mushy)
1⁄4 cup (75 g) sea salt, for soaking,   
  plus more to taste
Coconut oil, for fryingOlive oil, for frying
Guacamole
3 ripe avocados, peeled and pitted
1⁄4 cup (60 ml) lime juice
1⁄4 cup (60 ml) pineapple juice
1 tablespoon honey 
1⁄2 cup (80 g) chopped red onion 
1⁄4 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon sea saltTo Make It
1.  To make the chips: Peel the plantains and slice them thinly. Place 
the slices in a bowl of room-temperature water with the salt. Soak the plantain slices for at least 3 hours and up to 24 hours, either at room temperature or in the fridge. 
2.  After soaking, drain the plantain slices using a paper towel or cloth 
napkin, making sure they are as dry as possible. In a medium pot, heat a 50–50 blend of coconut and olive oil (or your favorite cooking oil) over medium-high until it reaches an average temperature of 325°F (170°C), 5 to 7 minutes. Using long tongs or a slotted spoon, carefully place the sliced plantains into the oil. Fry the sliced plantains for 5 to 7 minutes until they are golden to medium brown.
3.  Remove the plantain chips from the oil and place them into a basket 
lined with a paper towel to absorb the excess grease. Allow them to cool completely and salt to taste.
4.  To make the guacamole: Combine all the guacamole ingredients in a food processor and process until smooth and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes.
Tip  If the mixture isn’t thick enough, 
add another avocado.GO VEGAN!  Use agave nectar instead of honey.

TextTo Make It
1.  To make the bread coating: Stir the butter, garlic, and honey until combined and set aside.
2.  To make the spread: Combine the sun-dried tomatoes, cooked bacon, cream, mayonnaise, 
Parmesan, garlic powder, rosemary, and onion in a food processor. Process until smooth and creamy. Using a spatula, scrape the spread into a bowl and transfer it to the refrigerator. 
3.  To make the glaze: Pour the balsamic vinegar, sugar, and salt into a small saucepan. Heat the mixture on medium, stirring occasionally, until the glaze reduces by half and becomes syrupy but not too thick. Remove from heat and allow to cool.
4.  Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). 
5.  Meanwhile, brush the bread coating mixture evenly over each slice of bread, making sure 
to cover it entirely. Place the coated bread slices on a baking sheet and bake them until they start to turn slightly brown, 5 to 7 minutes. 
6.  Take your spread out of the refrigerator and heat it on the stove for 3 to 5 minutes so it’s 
a little warmer than room temperature. Using a spoon, cover each slice of bread with a generous amount of the spread, so that the coating is ¾ to 1 inch (20 to 25 mm) thick. 
7.  On top of the spread, place one slice of mozzarella, leaving the edges uncovered and making 
sure that the cheese covers at least two-thirds of the bread. Place the bread back in the oven and bake until the cheese is melted, 7 to 10 minutes. 
8.  Drizzle about ½ teaspoon of balsamic glaze over the top of each piece of bread. Then place 
about a teaspoon of the chopped scallions and roasted red peppers on each piece. 
9.  Serve the bread on a dark-colored plate. Drizzle additional glaze on the plate and around 
the bread. Garnish with something green like curly kale or parsley. . . and don’t forget the plastic beetles!
Tip Don’t allow your cheese to get brown, runny, or crispy. When it is ready, it should be 
tender and stretchy.

1⁄4 cup (60 ml) grapeseed/canola   
  oil blend 
Mango vinegar, such as Huilerie  
  Beaujolaise, to tasteTo Make It
1.  To make the basil oil: Quickly blanch the basil and spinach in boiling water 
for 30 seconds. Remove and transfer the greens to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and squeeze as much liquid from the greens as possible. Mix the greens with the oil blend and, ideally, refrigerate overnight. 
2.  Strain to remove the greens and discard them.
3.  To make the salad: Preheat a deep fryer to 325°F (170°C). (If you don’t have a deep fryer, use a frying pan with ½ inch, or 13 mm, of cooking oil of your choice.) In a separate medium frying pan, lightly toss the peach slices in 2 tablespoons of the oil blend and a pinch of salt. Grill until tender over medium heat, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove peaches from the heat and set aside. 
4.  When the deep fryer (or your frying pan with ½ inch, or 13 mm, of cooking 
oil) is ready, slowly lower each prosciutto slice into the oil and cook until crispy, about 90 seconds. Place the finished slices on a paper towel-lined plate. When cool, chop into small pieces.
5.  To make the peach vinaigrette: Add the peaches and blend all together. Add mango vinegar to taste. 
6.  Toss the peach vinaigrette with the spring mix and frisée in a large bowl.
7.  Place the grilled peach slices on a plate and cover with the lettuce mixture. 
Garnish with the radish, micro basil, prosciutto, and salt. Finally, drizzle the basil oil around the edges of the plate.

TextThe Butcher’s Stew
Prep Time: 25 minutes  |  Cook time: 4 hours  |  Yield: 12-16 servings
The base of this classic, New York firehouse-style chili recipe was shared with 
me by a friend who works at New York Ladder. I, of course, doctored it to be 
a bit darker and more evil! Depending on how meaty you want the chili, you 
can add more or less ground beef to your version, but make sure you cook it 
on that low steady temperature for a few hours to let the flavors soak in.
Deadly Ingredients
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 red bell pepper, diced1 green bell pepper, diced2 large red onions, diced2 to 4 pounds (907 g to 1.8 kg) ground beef 
  (see headnote) 
1 teaspoon crushed garlic or garlic paste  3 tablespoons chili powder 1
1⁄2 tablespoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon2 tablespoons sriracha sauce1 teaspoon salt1 teaspoon black pepper1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning2 tablespoons sugar2 large cans (23 ounces, or 660 g each) tomato soup4 cans (14.5 ounces, or 411 g, each) stewed tomatoes 15 ounces (1
3⁄4 cups, or 425 g) canned crushed  
  tomatoes 2 cans (15.25 ounces, or 432 g, each) whole-kernel   
  corn, drained
2 cans (15 ounces, or 425 g, each) kidney beans2 cans (15 ounces, or 425 g, each) black beans, drainedChopped scallion greens, for servingShredded cheddar or vegan cheddar-style 
  cheese, for servingTo Make It
1.  Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium 
for about 3 minutes. Then add the chopped bell 
peppers and onions. Sauté for 3 minutes. 
2.  Add the ground beef, garlic, chili powder, cumin, 
cinnamon, and sriracha. Continue to cook until the meat is browned, about 5 minutes. 
3.  Add the salt, pepper, Cajun seasoning, and sugar. 
Stir to combine thoroughly. 
4.  After the meat and veggies are cooked, add the 
tomato soup and stewed tomatoes. (Use a large spoon or potato smasher and try to smash up the stewed tomatoes.) Then add the crushed tomatoes, corn, and beans. Cook on low heat for at least 2 hours (or up to 3 hours for maximum flavor). 
5.  To serve, divide the stew among bowls. Drizzle with 
a swirl of Sweet Lime Cream Sauce (page 18), and sprinkle with fresh chopped scallions and a little shredded cheese. Serve with a piece of Hallowpeño Honey Cheddar Cornbread (page 41).
GO VEGAN!  Use tempeh or meatless crumbles in 
lieu of ground beef.

TextEdward Burger Hands
Prep Time: 10 minutes  |  Cook time: 15 Minutes  |  Yield: 1 serving
This is where it all began: Beetle House’s very first recipe. I wanted to make a burger 
with a lot of different parts, just like Edward Scissorhands. After some experimenting, 
Edward Burger Hands was born. This burger is absolutely overflowing with seven 
layers, and the only way we could figure out how to keep it closed was to shove a pair 
of scissors right through it. Edward is always an inspiration! 
Deadly Ingredients
Egg, Sunny-Side Up
1⁄2 tablespoon butter
1 egg
Burger
Pinch of salt and black pepper
Pinch of garlic powderPinch of ground cinnamon1 burger patty (8 ounces, or 227 g)1 slice Pepper Jack cheese 1 burger bun2 strips bacon, fried1 piece romaine lettuce 1 slice tomato 2 slices avocado 2 large pieces roasted red peppers
Veruca Sauce 
See page 20, to taste
Edward Sauce
See page 17, to tasteTo Make It
1.  To make the egg, sunny-side up: In a small frying pan, dissolve the 
butter on medium heat. Then crack open an egg and add it to the pan, cooking until the whites are set and the yolks are cooked to desired doneness, about 4 to 5 minutes.
2.  To make the burger: In a small bowl, mix together equal parts salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cinnamon. In a large bowl, add the burger patty and the seasoning mixture, pressing the mixture into the patty until it is seasoned. Don’t overdo it here, just make sure the patty is coated.
3.  For a rare patty, cook in a small frying pan over medium heat for 
2½ minutes per side. For a well-done patty, cook for 5 minutes on each side. Then add the cheese and cook until it is melted. Remove from the heat. 
4.  Brush the inside of both the top and bottom bun with a hearty 
amount of Veruca Sauce, then toast the bun in the pan or in a toaster oven for about 3 to 5 minutes, or cook until it is golden brown.
5.  Spread the Edward Sauce on the inside of the bottom bun, and then 
place the patty on top. On top of the burger, place the egg, and then the bacon. Using a squirt bottle, decorate the top with Edward Sauce. 
6.  On the top bun, add the lettuce, tomato, avocado, and roasted red 
peppers. Serve with sides of your choosing.

If the Demon Barber had a favorite steak, this would be it. To up the  
creepy factor, splatter the sauce to resemble blood and serve the dish with  
a straight shaving razor, which conveniently doubles as a steak knife.
Deadly Ingredients
Steak
1 tablespoon butter, softened
2 filets mignon (8 ounces, 
  or 227 g, each)
Pinch salt and pepperPinch garlic powderPinch ground cinnamon

1.  To make the steak: Coat the outside of each filet with the 
butter. Then sprinkle each side with a mixture of salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cinnamon. Cook the filets on medium heat in a pan or on a grill (it’s your choice, but I recommend pan cooking) to your desired taste, 2½ minutes per side for rare and 5 minutes per side for well-done. Then remove from the heat. 
2.  To make the garlic mash: Peel the potatoes and then cut each into 3 or 4 pieces. Boil them until soft, 15 to 20 minutes. 
3.  T ransfer the potato pieces to another pot or just drain them 
and put them back in the same pot. Add the butter, half-and-half, salt, crushed garlic, and sugar. Smash with a potato smasher, and then whip with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. 
4.  Divide the mash between two plates and place the steaks on 
top. Garnish with the Sweeney Sauce, spooning a generous amount over the steak. Then splatter the sauce around the dish to resemble splattered blood.

1.  To make the pea puree: In a blender, add the blanched 
peas, the oil blend, and peeled garlic cloves. Blend together until smooth, and then add salt to taste.  
2.  To make the risotto: Warm the oil blend in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the rice and stir constantly until lightly toasted, about 12 minutes. Add the shallots and garlic to sweat with the rice for about 2 minutes. Deglaze by pouring the white wine into the pan. Once the wine is cooked off, and there is almost no liquid left, then slowly add 3 cups (700 ml) of the chicken stock and stir for about 30 minutes or until the rice is al dente. Remove from saucepan and let cool to room temperature. 
3.  Heat the cooled risotto with the remaining ½ cup 
(120 ml) chicken stock over medium-low heat for about 1½ minutes. Add the smoked ham hock and fold in the Pea Puree. Continue to stir for a minute or two, then stir in the butter, Parmesan, and English peas.
4.  To make the pea tendril salad: Mix the pea tendrils with lemon juice, olive oil, and salt to taste.
5.  Garnish the risotto with the pea tendril salad. Zest the 
lemon peel over the dish.

1.  To make the marinade: Mix all the marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinate the lamb chop for 2 to 6 hours 
before cooking.
2.  To make the lamb: When ready to cook, remove the lamb chops from the marinade. If using an open-flame grill, place the lamb chop on the grill and cook on medium for 3 to 5 minutes per side. A little char around the edges is preferable. If using a frying pan, place the lamb chop and marinade in the pan, and coat the lamb chop, cooking them on medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Remove the lamb chop and set aside.
3.  To make the sauce: Heat the butter in the frying pan over medium heat until melted. Then add the garlic, onion, mushrooms, rosemary, and apple slices to the pan and sauté for approximately 3 minutes.  
4.  Add the apple cider, salt, and pepper. Raise the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring often, until the sauce 
thickens to a syrupy consistency and caramelizes (see Tip).
5.  Return the lamb chop to the frying pan and coat with the sauce, turning several times. 
6.  To make the raspberry glaze: Add the ingredients to a small saucepan and heat on medium until the mixture has the consistency of syrup, approximately 5 minutes.  
7.  To serve, spoon the mushrooms, apples, and onions in the center of the plate. Place the lamb chop on top and drizzle 
2 to 3 tablespoons of the sauce over it. Drizzle more glaze around the plate to mimic blood splatters.
Tip Some of the apple cider will cook off in the pan, so if you find it is too thick, add another 1⁄4 cup (60 ml) apple 
cider to thin it out a bit.

1.  To make the basil oil: Drop the basil and spinach in boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove 
from water and transfer the greens to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and squeeze as much liquid from the greens as possible with your bare hands into the sink. Stir with the oil blend and refrigerate overnight. Then strain through cheesecloth into a plastic container to save for later. 
2.  To make the fish: Preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C). Heat the oil blend in a large, ovenproof pan over medium heat. Add the salmon and sauté until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip the salmon and place the pan in the oven for 3 to 5 minutes.
3.  To make the sweet corn succotash: Sauté the peppers and onions in a pan over medium heat with a small amount of the oil blend for 3 to 4 minutes. Char the corn on the grill, then remove the kernels by slicing down the stalk with your knife. Sauté the corn with the other vegetables for 2 minutes. Stir in the butter, salt, and pepper. Set aside.
4.  To make the roasted red pepper puree: Lightly coat the peppers in ¼ cup (60 ml) of the oil blend and 1 tablespoon of the salt. Grill each side about 2 minutes, until blackened on both sides. T ransfer the peppers to a plastic container, cover with cling wrap, and set aside until they reach room temperature, about 20 minutes. Then gently remove the charred skin with your finger and remove the seeds. Place the peppers in a blender with the remaining ¼ cup (60 ml) oil blend, remaining 1 tablespoon salt, and the garlic, and blend until smooth. Season to taste.
5.  Place 3 ounces of succotash in the center of the plate and lay the salmon on top. Drizzle 
the puree and basil oil over the fish and around the plate. Then garnish with the micro shiso leaf.

TextL ove It Pot Pie
Prep Time: 30 minutes  |  Cook time: 20 Minutes  |  Yield: 2 servings
Unlike Mrs. Lovett’s suspicious meat pies in Sweeney Todd, 
our Love It Pot Pie is a sweet and spicy Southern take on that cozy  
English classic: chicken pot pie. Still…enjoy with caution.
Deadly Ingredients
Chicken
2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts 
1⁄4 cup (60 ml) olive oil 
1 teaspoon crushed garlic or garlic paste
1⁄4 cup (60 ml) lemon juice
Veget able Sauce
2 tablespoons butter, salted 
1⁄2 cup (120 ml) chicken stock
1⁄2 cup (120 ml) whole milk
1⁄2 cup (80 g) chopped onion 
1⁄2 cup (65 g) frozen peas
1⁄2 cup (65 g) chopped carrots
1⁄2 cup (60 g) chopped red bell peppers
1 cup (235 ml) Love It Sauce (page 16)
1 whole sprig fresh rosemary 
1⁄2 teaspoon finely chopped rosemary 
1⁄2 cup (35 g) chopped cremini mushrooms
Hallowpeño Honey  
Cheddar Cornbread 
See page 41, 1 recipe
Beetle Jam
See page 29, 1⁄2 teaspoonTo Make It
1.  To make the chicken: Marinate the chicken breasts 
overnight in the olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice. The next day, grill or cook the chicken breast on medium heat in a frying pan or grill until fully cooked, 4 to 6 minutes per side, making sure there is no pink in the meat. Slice or chop the chicken into medium-size chunks or strips. 
2.  To make the vegetable sauce: Add the butter, chicken stock, and milk to a frying pan along with the onion, peas, carrots, and peppers. Stirring frequently, cook on medium heat until the vegetables are fully cooked, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the Love It Sauce and continue stirring until the mixture is smooth and creamy, like an alfredo sauce. (See Tip.) Add the chicken to the sauce. Cook until the sauce is bubbling and thick, another 3 to 5 minutes. 
3.  Place two pieces of the cornbread at the bottom of each 
large bowl and top with several spoonfuls of the sauce, until all of the cornbread is covered. Place several pieces of chicken on top of the sauce. Top it all off with the Beetle Jam.
Tip If the sauce is too thick, thin it out with a little 
milk. If the sauce is too thin, thicken it with a little bit 
of cornstarch or flour.

1.  To make the shrimp: Sauté the shrimp in a pan on medium heat with butter, olive oil, garlic, 
and a pinch of salt and pepper. Coat with the Hollow Sauce. 
2.  To make the cheesy corn grits: Add the grits, milk, and salt to a pan. While constantly 
whisking, cook the grits on low to medium heat, until creamy and smooth, 12 to 15 minutes. Mix in the butter and cheeses and stir until melted.
3.  To make the chorizo oil: Cook the chorizo in a small pot over low heat until fully cooked, 25 to 30 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer, and then strain again through a cheesecloth, reserving the oil and discarding the meat.
4.  To make the scallion oil: Drop the scallions and spinach in boiling water for 30 seconds, then remove and transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and squeeze as much liquid as possible from the greens with your hands into the sink. Stir in with the oil blend and, ideally, refrigerate overnight. Then strain through cheesecloth into an airtight plastic container. It will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. 
5.  Place a hearty amount of the grits in the center of each plate, followed by the shrimp glazed in 
the Hollow Sauce. Drizzle both oils over the top and garnish with micro basil (or micro cilantro if you don’t want me to eat it, see page 35).

Prep Time: 40 minutes  |  Cook time: 6–9 Hours  |  Yield: 8–10 servings
This is my take on a classic Southern-style pulled pork, jacked up with a bit 
of heat and some macabre flair. Although this recipe from Beetle House New 
York City uses two of our signature sauces and the pork requires a lengthy 
cook time, be reassured that this slow-cooked dish is WORTH IT. Serve this 
incredible open-faced sandwich with any of your favorite side dishes.  
We recommend the Garlic Mash (page 66). 
Pork
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 red onion, finely chopped
3⁄4 cup (175 ml) water
1 boneless pork shoulder (3 pounds,  
  or 1.4 kg), trimmed of skin and fat

TextTo Make It
1.  To make the pork: Place 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, the onions, and the water in the bottom 
of a slow cooker. Rub the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil all over the pork, along with the salt, pepper, garlic, cinnamon, and chipotle powder. T ransfer the pork to the slow cooker and top with the honey, soy sauce, and liquid smoke. Cover and cook on low until very tender, about 8 hours, or on medium for 5 to 6 hours. 
2.  Remove the meat from the slow cooker. When the meat is cool enough to handle, tear it into 
thin shreds using two forks, making sure to remove any fat or gristle. Skim any excess fat from the liquid in the slow cooker. Return the pulled pork to the slow cooker and stir in the Soul Sauce and mustard. Cover and cook for another hour on low.
3.  To make the jalapeño coleslaw: Place the coleslaw mix and jalapeño in a large bowl. In a small bowl, mix together the remaining ingredients, stirring until fully blended. Pour the dressing over the coleslaw. Mix well and refrigerate until serving. 
4.  To make the sandwich: Generously brush the insides of the top and bottom of the kaiser rolls with the Veruca Sauce, making sure to cover the insides completely. Then, in a pan or on the grill, toast the rolls (buttered side facing down) until golden brown and slightly crisp, about 2 to 5 minutes. 
5.  Slice each of the pickled eggs into approximately 5 slices. Place a generous amount of the pulled 
pork on the bottom buns, followed by the coleslaw and three slices of the pickled egg. 
6.  On the inside of the top buns, spread a generous amount of the Beetle Jam. Serve the sandwich 
open-faced, with the top bun face up next to the bottom bun.

TextWilly’s Mango Panna Cotta 
Prep Time: 30 minutes  |  Cook time: 10 Minutes  |  Yield: 4 servings
A Beetle House Los Angeles original developed by the indominable Chef Christoffer Binotto, 
this creamy mango panna cotta is topped with passion fruit foam and served with diced kiwi, 
fresh strawberries, and Cocoa Puffs! Serve in a cool “wonky” goblet, champagne flute, or even a 
margarita glass. Make a statement with this dessert, just like Willy would have done!
Deadly Ingredients
Panna Cott a
2 cups (475 ml) 
  mango juice
1 cup (235 ml) heavy cream3 tablespoons sugar1 teaspoon powdered   
  gelatin
Passion Fruit 
Foam
2 tablespoons soy lecithin   
  (see Tip)
11⁄2 cups (355 ml) passion   
  fruit juice1 tablespoon heavy cream1 tablespoon unsalted  
  butter
Topping
3 kiwis, diced
6 strawberries, diced1 cup (27 g) Cocoa PuffsTo Make It
1.  Chill the bowls you will be using to serve the panna cotta in the refrigerator.
2.  To make the panna cotta: In a medium saucepan, bring the mango juice to a boil 
and boil until the juice is reduced by half. Then fold in the cream and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 4 to 5 minutes.
3.  Whisk the sugar and gelatin together in a bowl. Then whisk this mixture into the 
saucepan and let simmer for another 2 minutes. T ransfer the liquid from the saucepan into a bowl and whisk every 4 minutes until the mixture cools to room temperature. 
4.  When the mixture has reached room temperature, pour into your already chilled 
serving vessels then let them set in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.
5.  To make the passion fruit foam: In a bowl, whisk the soy lecithin with just enough water to make it a thick, pasty consistency. In a medium saucepan, bring the passion fruit juice to a boil. 
6.  Add the cream and butter, and then whisk in the lecithin paste. Let the mixture boil 
for 1 minute to activate and start forming the foam. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Finally, transfer the cooled liquid to a blender and blend to emulsify. 
7.  To make the topping: Top the panna cotta with the diced kiwis and strawberries. Scatter the Cocoa Puffs on top of the panna cotta with the diced fruit, and crown it all off with the passion fruit foam.
Tip Soy lecithin is what helps to create that foam from the passion fruit on top of Willy’s Panna Cotta. It’s not readily 
available in all stores, but you can definitely buy it online.

Prep Time: 30 minutes  |  Cook time: 30 minutes  |  Yield: 8 servings
My take on a classic cobbler has a bit of a twist. This recipe blends dark 
cherries and blood oranges to create a bloody, gruesome-looking cobbler, 
like something you might see served at Mrs. Lovett’s shop. Don’t let the 
bloody mess fool you—this cobbler is delicious, especially when served 
warm with some ice cream! Ready for your close shave? Let’s begin.
Deadly Ingredients
Crust
11⁄4 cups (156 g) unbleached all-purpose flour
1⁄3 cup (67 g) raw sugar
1⁄4 teaspoon sea salt
1⁄2 cup (1 stick or 112 g) salted butter, cut into 
  6 slices 
1 egg yolk 2 tablespoons cold water1 teaspoon vanilla extractFilling
12 ounces (340 g) frozen, pitted 
  unsweetened dark cherries
1⁄4 cup (60 ml) agave nectar 
1 blood orange, peeled
1⁄4 teaspoon sea salt

TextTo Make It
1.  To make the crust: Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a food processor. Pulse a few times until fully mixed. 
Add the butter and pulse until the mixture has the texture of a crumb topping; the butter pieces should be larger than small peas. 
2.  In a mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolk, cold water, and vanilla. Add the mixture to the food processor 
and pulse 5 or 6 times until a dough starts to form, being careful not to overmix. 
3.  T ransfer the dough to a sheet of plastic wrap on a flat work surface, such as a countertop or cutting board. Form 
the dough into a big ball and then smash it down into a disk roughly 8 inches (20 cm) across. Wrap the dough in the plastic and place it in the refrigerator for 25 to 40 minutes. 
4.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and roll it out into a flat square about ¼ inch (5 mm) thick. Cut the 
dough into 3 to 5 strips. Reserve any extra dough crumbles.
5.  Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). 
6.  To make the filling: Put the cherries and agave nectar into a saucepan and heat on medium-low for 5 minutes. Remove any seeds, if any, from the blood orange. Puree it in a food processor and then add the puree to the cherry mixture. 
7.  Increase the heat to medium and continue to cook for another 5 to 7 minutes. Then add the water and sugar, 
continuing to cook for about 15 more minutes, until a medium-thick syrup (the consistency of corn syrup) starts to form. Remove from the heat. (See Tip.)
8.  Place two strips of dough and some of the reserved dough crumbles in the bottom of the prepared dish. Pour the 
berry mix on top. Then take the remaining pieces of dough and cover the top of the berry mix. Bake uncovered for 6 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 350°F (180°C) and cook for another 24 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 15 to 20 minutes before serving.  
9.  Always serve this cobbler warm, ideally on a white plate, and drip a little of the berry syrup around the edges. 
Garnish the plate with a straight razor (without the blade) and a fake finger or ear, remembering to place it under the cobbler, so it’s not seen until your guest starts eating!
Tip If the berry mixture gets too thick, add a little more water. If it is not thick enough after 15 or so minutes, 
increase the heat slightly and continue to cook a little longer.

TextBlood Orange Cheesecake
Prep Time: 2 Hours  |  Cook time: 85–95 Minutes  |  Yield: 10-12 servings
If you’ve never had a blood orange before, then you’re in for a sweet treat. 
Named for its dark crimson flesh color, this antioxidant-rich fruit lends a 
bloody, berry tinge to one of Chef Christoffer Binotto’s signature desserts. Rich 
and creamy, this cheesecake is an absolute must for any Halloween-themed bash 
or just a romantic evening with the vampire in your life.

TextTo Make It
1.  Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Grease an 8-inch (20 cm) cheesecake or springform pan with cooking 
spray. Line the pan with parchment paper and coat it with cooking spray as well.
2.  To make the crust: Add the golden Oreos to the food processor and process until all large pieces have been 
broken up. T ransfer the processed Oreos to a bowl and stir in the melted butter. Press the mixture into the 
bottom of the pan until you form an even layer.
3.  To make the filling: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar and cornstarch. Add the cream cheese, 
one package at a time, while beating together the ingredients with an electric mixer. Then add the eggs, one at a time, followed by the sour cream, heavy cream, orange zest, and juice. Keep mixing until you have a smooth batter. T ransfer the batter to the pan, spreading it on top of the crust.
4.  Place the cheesecake pan in a larger pan and fill the larger pan with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. This water bath 
will help prevent the cheesecake from cracking while it bakes.
5.  T ransfer the pan to the oven and bake the cheesecake for 15 minutes. Then lower the heat to 300°F (150°C) 
and continue baking for an additional 70 to 80 minutes. 
6.  Allow the cheesecake to cool down in the oven with the heat off and the door ajar for 1 hour. (Note that the 
center will still jiggle slightly.) Then place the cheesecake in the refrigerator to chill overnight.
7.  To make the glaze: Meanwhile, place the orange slices, water, and sugar in a saucepan and bring the mixture 
to a simmer. Continue to cook, stirring the mixture occasionally, until the liquid is thick and syrupy, about 20 minutes. Pour the glaze into a plastic container and refrigerate. Take out orange slices and dip them into a sugar, then put them into a plastic container and store until cheesecake is done. 
8.  In the morning, transfer the cheesecake to a serving platter and top with the glaze.

TextBeetle Pie
Prep Time: 30 minutes  |  Yield: 8 servings (1 pie)
The colors and textures of this pie are inspired by one of my all-time favorite 
films, Beetlejuice. I wanted the look of it alone to somehow remind you of Tim 
Burton and his marvelous, memorable goth-com. The brilliant green color of the 
homemade pistachio pudding and the crunchy chocolate crust evoke the corpse-fed 
grass and rich soil of a graveyard, while the seedy and sweet blackberry jam mimics 
the texture of blood and bugs. You can store the pie, covered, in the refrigerator for 
up to a week, but it is best served within 12 to 24 hours. Rich, thick, and creepily 
delicious, Beetle Pie is a perfect dessert for any occasion for pistachio lovers—but 
we of course recommend it for Halloween.

35 chocolate cookie wafers 
1⁄4 cup (1⁄2 stick or 55 g) salted  
  butter, melted and cooled to

TextTo Make It
1.  To make the crust: Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). 
2.  Place the cookie wafers into a food processor and 
pulse until the crumbs are about the size of peas. Add 
the melted butter and continue to process until the consistency is like coffee grounds. 
3.  T ransfer the crumbs to a 9-inch (23 cm) pie plate. Use a cup or your hands to firmly press the crumbs evenly into the bottom and sides of the pan. Bake until fragrant, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove and cool completely before filling.
4.  To make the filling: Place the pistachios into the food processor. Add 
1⁄3 cup (67 g) of the sugar. Pulse until 
the nuts and sugar are as close to the consistency of powder as you can get. Add the water and pulse until the mixture becomes a paste. 
5.  In a medium saucepan, whisk together the pistachio 
paste, vanilla extract, and milk over medium heat until the mixture just starts to boil slightly. Then remove it from the heat.  
6.  In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the remaining 
1⁄3 cup (66 g) sugar, the egg yolks, cornstarch, and salt. 
Continue whisking until you have a smooth yellow paste. Add the egg mixture to the milk mixture and return to medium heat, whisking frequently until the pudding starts to boil. Whisk for another 30 to 60 seconds, until the pudding thickens fully, then remove from the heat. 7.  Stir in the butter until it is melted and blended with 
the pudding. Add 2 to 3 drops of green food coloring or green food dye to get a brilliant green color. T ransfer the pudding to a container with a lid and place in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours, or until cold.
8.  To make the blackberry jam: Place the fresh blackberries, water, and sugar into a medium saucepan. Heat on medium for approximately 20 minutes, stirring frequently and using a whisk to break up the berries. Continue to heat and stir until a medium-thick syrup has formed. Remove from the heat. 
9.  Using a spatula, pour the cold pudding into the pie 
crust. Fill the crust to about 2 inches (5 cm) below the top of the crust edge. Use the spatula to make sure the mixture is spread evenly.  
10.  Using another spatula, dab a large helping of jam 
(about the diameter of a DVD and ¼ inch or 5 mm thick) into the center of the pie. Using the same spatula, drip more jam in random places around the edges and other areas of the pie (think blood spatter). 
11.  Place the whipped topping directly in the center of 
the pie. Use a spatula to create peaks and valleys in the whipped topping so that it resembles a cloud. Finish the dessert by sticking the whole blackberries in the whipped topping in random places to resemble bugs. 
12.  Serve the pie on a white plate and garnish with small 
plastic beetles and/or spiders dipped in the blackberry jam. Refrigerate the plates with the bugs and pie on them for an hour before serving.
Go Vegan! Substitute vegan chocolate cookies, plain or vanilla almond milk, and vegan whipped cream (such as 
So Delicious CocoWhip). Use coconut oil in place of the butter and half a banana or a vegan egg substitute in place of 
the egg yolks.

TextTo Make It
1.  To make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease the bottoms of two 8-inch (20 cm) round cake 
pans with cooking spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper. 
2.  In a saucepan, melt the semisweet chocolate in a double boiler over low heat and then let it cool to room 
temperature. Meanwhile, sift the flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt into a small bowl.
3.  Using a stand mixer or a hand mixer, blend the brown sugar, butter, eggs, vanilla, and espresso in a large bowl for 
3 minutes. Gradually add in the melted chocolate and food coloring as you mix. Then add in the flour mixture 
and buttermilk, mixing on a low setting until smooth. 
4.  Pour the mixture into the prepared pans, transfer to the oven, and bake until the cake springs back when touched, 
33 to 38 minutes. Allow the cakes to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, and then invert the cakes onto a cooling rack to cool completely.
5.  To make the sauce: Combine the sugar, water, and cornstarch in a small saucepan. Cook on medium heat until it simmers, and then add the raspberries. Cook until the raspberries break down, about 4 minutes. Once the mixture has a syrupy texture, strain it through a fine-mesh strainer to remove the pulp and seeds.
6.  To make the ganache: Place the chopped chocolate in a medium bowl. Pour the heavy cream into a saucepan and heat until it simmers. Then pour the heated cream over the chocolate in the bowl and let sit for a few minutes. Finally, whisk the cream and chocolate together until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth. 
7.  To make the stained-glass candy shards: Line a baking sheet or baking pan with foil and sift the confectioner’s sugar over the entire pan. In a heavy-bottomed pot, add the water, granulated sugar, and corn syrup. Stir to start dissolving sugar and then turn heat up to medium and let the sugar dissolve on its own. Wet a pastry brush and brush down the crystals that form on the side of the pot or else the sauce will turn gritty. Once the sugar dissolves, insert a candy thermometer and bring the mixture to a boil. Don’t stir the mixture while boiling.
8.  When the temperature reaches 300°F (150°C), remove the pot from the heat and add the food coloring and 
extract, stirring to combine. Pour the candy mixture onto the foil-lined pan, tilting it to spread out the mixture. Cool for at least 1 hour. 
9.  Once the mixture has cooled, take a mallet and crack the mixture into pieces (they can be randomly sized). Then 
shake off the excess confectioner’s sugar and store the shards in plastic containers. 
10.  Once the cakes have cooled, spread some of the raspberry sauce over the bottom layer and then top with the 
second layer. Starting in the center, pour the cooled ganache over the cake, and use a spatula to smooth the chocolate all over the outside of it. 
11.  To decorate, stick the stained glass candy shards into the top of the cake. Serve with whipped cream and the 
remaining raspberry sauce.
Tip While the candy is cooling, place it on a trivet. The bottom of the pan gets really hot and may burn the counter.
