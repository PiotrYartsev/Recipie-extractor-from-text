(Text)ixIntroduction
I am a yonsei —a fourth-generation Japanese-American. Simply put, my 
great-grandparents on both sides were born in Japan and were the first 
in my family to move to America. My parents and grandparents were both interned to concentration camps during World War II. My G reat 
Uncle Joe Fujimoto, on my mom’s side, fought in the 44
2nd—the only 
fighting unit in the U.S. Army composed entirely of those with Japanese ancestry, while their families were subject to internment. Crazy stuff. I grew up in Fullerton, California, with an older brother and sister in the heart of Orange County. Even though I went to Japanese school on Saturdays for over eight years and studied Japanese in college, I don’t speak the language much, but that’s pretty common among yonsei.  
I find it ironic that my parents were taken from their homes and put into camps because of their ethnicity when their generation was taught to be as American as they could be to fit in—neither of my parents has any audible accent. They understood Japanese better than they could speak it, so the language wasn’t often spoken in our home. I had never even been to Japan before I wrote this book.
For most of my childhood, we ate spaghetti and meatballs more 
often than we ate Japanese food, but we always had Japanese rice in a cooker that kept it warm for days. I know all the yonsei out there can relate. To this day, pork chops with white fluffy rice is a favorite dish of mine. It’s this melding of Japan and America that has shaped my perspective on ramen. I felt that if I didn’t go to Japan and eat and see where ramen came from, and if I didn’t try to learn how to make it from an expert ramen master, I wouldn’t feel like I had enough knowledge to write this book.
Going to Tokyo and eating some of the best ramen and attending 
ramen school in Osaka was life-changing—not only for this cookbook but for me as a Japanese-American, and the ramen experiences helped me develop my basic recipes and tailor them so that they are better suited for home cooks.
Closer to home, my research began at the best ramen shops near 
where I live in Northern California. I learned the difference between

(Text)x Simply Ramena good bowl of ramen and a great one. Most important to me are first the texture of the noodles and 
then the umami factor of the soup. Since high-quality ingredients were a given, I sourced mine from farmers’ markets, local grocers, and Asian and Japanese markets—looking for organic where possible. I also got creative with leftovers and ingredients from my pantry.
For reference, I turned to the church cookbooks my family collected over the years from both my 
father’s Buddhist roots and my mother’s Presbyterian side. I gathered ideas from favorite recipes that have been passed down over generations and from old, treasured, Japanese cookbooks that  
my Auntie Alice gave me. The way that I make ramen is not 100 percent traditional, but with a big family to feed, I’ve needed to adopt a more practical approach for making delicious meals with ingredients that are accessible to me.
In this book, you’ll learn the basics of making the traditional ramen soup bases and well-known 
toppings, as well as my original-style versions. If you like your ramen spicy, prefer vegetarian options, or other variations, you’ll find plenty of those recipes here along with special dishes, such as Chilled Cucumber Tsukemen (page 117), where noodles are served separately to be dipped into a refreshing cold broth, and a Spicy Pork Tantanmen (page 98) with a mazamen , or no-broth, version 
of Chinese Dan Dan noodles, made with a sauce of blended chili oil, chili pepper, and sesame pastes with Szechuan-numbing spices inspired by the best tantanmen I had in Tokyo. And there’s a Kamo Matcha Ramen (page 129) topped with tea-and-soy-sauce smoked duck, sliced pear, cilantro, and a marinated half-cooked egg that spills its liquid gold into a matcha-infused Shio (salt-based) broth. 
I suggest you approach ramen as a step-by-step process that needn’t be done in one day, making 
the soup base, noodles, and some basic toppings ahead of time. When you’re ready to eat, you’ll be surprised at how quickly you can pull it together.
My goal is to give you a taste of ramen culture, encourage you to learn more, and inspire you to 
create your own versions of ramen. All of my recipes call for one of the four basic soup bases—Tonkotsu, Shio, Miso, and Shoyu—but almost all of them can be interchanged, so don’t feel like you have to use the one I’ve specified. Most of the ingredients for the recipes can be found in grocery stores or at farmers’ markets, with only a few key ingredients, such as dashi  (Japanese stock) and kombu  (kelp 
used for flavoring soup stocks), that you may need to seek out at an Asian market or order online.
This is your chance to make your grocery shopping a cultural adventure and take your kids to  
a nearby Japanese grocery store. You’ll be surprised by the many types of miso, nori  (seaweed), and 
shoyu 	(soy sauce) there are to choose from. At our house, we’ve started a tradition of “build your own 
ramen night,” with one soup base that everyone likes and a selection of DIY toppings. That’s how I see ramen—it’s whatever makes you happy. With Simply Ramen , you can enjoy ramen your way.

(Text)xi How to Build a Bowl of RamenHow to Build a Bowl of Ramen 
This is not a recipe but an exercise for how you would assemble a 
bowl of ramen after you have made one or more of the soup bases and some of the toppings. Once you are able to orchestrate the timing of your ingredients to deliver a proper bowl that has all of the elements working together, these skills can then be transferred to any bowl that you make going forward. 
There’s an art to preparing everything in advance to ensure that 
all components are cooked perfectly and at the right temperatures when serving. My advice for following my recipes is to look at the prep time at the top of each To Make in Advance recipe to know which components need to be made ahead of time. If you have these ready, your actual prep time to put it all together will be fairly quick.
Follow these easy steps and you’ll have a bowl that will make you 
(and others) smile and give you the satisfaction that you’ve done it all from scratch at home—something to be proud of for sure.
* In addition to Ramen Toppings (page 17), there are a myriad of additional toppings 
and condiments for topping your bowls of ramen.  
Toppings: negi (green onion), sweet corn, parsley, butter, onions, yuzu citrus, bean sprouts, spinach, ginger, Japanese mushrooms (shitake, kirurage), kamaboko (Japanese fish cake), and takana (spicy pickled mustard greens).  
Condiments: white pepper, shoyu (soy sauce), shichimi-togarashi (mixed chili pepper spice), chili paste, fresh garlic, vinegar, chili oil, sesame seeds, and curry powder.To Make in

To Prep Before 
You Begin 
Additional Toppings  
and Condiments *
1 Place a pot of water to boil for your noodles. When it comes to a boil, make sure you wait until you 
have your soup base heated and your toppings ready to go before you cook your noodles.
2 In a large pot, bring your base or your base and stock (depending on the soup base you’re using) 
to a boil, then lower heat and let simmer until it’s ready to serve. Right before serving, crank it back up to boil. 
3 (Optional) Ladle some of the boiling noodle water into your ramen bowl(s) for a couple of minutes to warm them before plating. Return the water to the pot to return to a boil. 
4 Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as the noodles are done, shake out all of the excess water and lay them gently into your warmed serving bowls by folding them on top of each other so they do not look messy. Be prepared to assemble the entire bowl and serve it as soon as your noodles come out of the water! 
5 Pour piping hot soup over the noodles in each bowl. Place your ramen and additional toppings on top. You did it! Now sit down, savor the moment, and enjoy slurping it all away!

(Text)3 Ramen Soup Bases and NoodlesMiso Base
Leve L 1
Serves up to 12
Prep time: 45 minutesWinters in Hokkaido in northern Japan are severe and the  
comfort and warmth of a good Miso Ramen have made it a daily 
staple. The quality of the miso makes all the difference in this recipe, so shop around and taste a variety of miso to find one that will add more depth.
Here, I’ve made a super flavorful Miso Base, or misodare , that can 
be enjoyed any time. (Please see Rameducate Yourself on page 152 to learn about the three components of all ramen.) Store it in the refrigerator, and when needed, you can make individual servings or enough to feed your whole family—this base offers the convenience of a one-person portion or a meal for many, all according to the base-to-stock ratio (3 tablespoons Miso Base to 1 cup/235 ml chicken or vegetable stock). Whether you’re taking it to work for lunch or preparing a family meal, it will be worth the labor because once you make it, it’s practically instant to serve up later. The Miso Base can be refrigerated for up to a week or frozen for one month.

(Text)1 Add the carrot, onion, apple, celery, and garlic to a food processor. Pulse into a fine chop. It is 
better to use a food processor but if you don’t have one, finely chop these ingredients by hand.
2 Add the bacon fat and 1 tablespoon sesame oil to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the finely chopped fruit and vegetables and cook until onions are translucent and apple is tender, stirring occasionally, for 10–12 minutes. When done, turn heat down to medium-low.
3 Add your ground pork to the cooked vegetable mixture. Cook for about 8–10 minutes until the meat is no longer pink. Stir in the ginger, sriracha, soy sauce, kelp granules, apple cider vinegar, and salt. Incorporate well.
4 Return the entire mixture to the food processor and pulse until pork is finely ground. It is better to use a food processer, but if you don’t have one, then use a potato masher or wooden spoon to break the mixture into very small pieces in the skillet.
5 Add the sesame seed paste and miso to the ground pork mixture and mix well. It should have the consistency of a thick paste. Your base is done.
6 Bring the Miso Base and chicken or vegetable stock to a boil (depending on the number of people you are serving, use the ratio of 3 tablespoons Miso Base to 1 cup (235 ml) chicken or vegetable stock). Lower heat and let simmer until it’s ready to serve. Use about 2 cups (475 ml) soup per serving. Right before serving, crank the heat back up to boil the soup.
7 Pour 2 cups soup (475 ml) over each bowl of noodles. Top each bowl with desired toppings.

(Text)5 Ramen Soup Bases and NoodlesTonkotsu Base
The Tonkotsu Base is the holy grail of ramen soup bases, and this 
recipe follows the traditional recipe I learned to make from Sensei Miyajima Rikisai at the Miyajima Ramen School in Osaka, Japan. Tonkotsu, known as “white soup,” comes from two different regions in Japan. This version comes from the Kanto region of Tokyo. It uses a double-soup method, where two separate broths are combined right before serving, making a more complex and flavorful soup. Leve L 3

(Text)1 Before cooking, you must have the Chashu with its braising liquid on hand to use later.
2 Make the Seabura: Place the pork back fat in a large pot, cover with water, bring to a boil, and 
simmer for 4 hours, uncovered.
3 Make the Tonkotsu Soup: In a separate pot of boiling water, blanch the chicken feet, drain, and then add them to the pressure cooker along with the pork knuckles or trotters and the potatoes. Cover with up to 5 quarts (4.7 L) water, making sure the total volume of water and food combined does not exceed half of the pot.
4 Leave your pressure regulator weight off of the vent pipe. Turn heat to high until steam flows from the vent pipe (this may take up to 20 minutes) and continue to let vent for 10 minutes more while the steam displaces the air in the cooker. Maintain high heat setting and start timing your cooking when the regulator weight begins to jiggle or rock. It may appear as if it is leaking, but this is normal. Regulate the heat so that the weight only jiggles 1–4 times per minute. Start a timer and cook for 1 hour.
5 Make the Shiodare: In a medium-sized pot, bring the kombu, shiitake, and 4 cups (950 ml) water to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Drain the kombu and shiitake and put the soup into a clean medium-sized pot.
6 Return this drained soup to the stove, add the bonito flakes, and heat to a boil, then simmer for  
5 minutes. Drain the bonito flakes and put soup into your other empty pot, pressing the flakes to release all their liquid.
7 Return this drained soup to the stove and add the clams, bring to a boil, then simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the clams with a sieve and measure out 1 quart or 4 cups (1 L) soup into your other empty pot (you will have a minimal amount to discard). Whisk in 
1⁄2 cup (140 g) table salt. Note that the 
salt to soup ratio should be 20 percent, resulting in a very salty soup base or Shiodare .
8 After 1 hour, take the pressure cooker off the heat and allow the pressure gauge to return to 0 (zero) before gently removing the cover. Push down the pork bones to get the bone fat out and make the soup creamier and thicker. Cook on a medium low heat with the cover off for about 1 hour longer, mixing periodically.
9 Directly into your serving bowls, add 1 tablespoon of your Chashu braising liquid and 1 tablespoon Shiodare per serving to make a Shoyudare .
10 Drain and remove the pork back fat that has been simmering. Cut the strips into smaller 2-inch (5 cm) pieces. Into a medium-sized bowl, take a large-holed sieve and push a couple of pieces at a time through the sieve so that you see it come through the other side in small little bits. Repeat until all pieces are pushed through. Your Seabura is ready. Set aside.
11 Strain all of the solids from the Tonkotsu soup in the pressure cooker and transfer the soup to a separate pot and keep warm. Right before serving, crank it up to a boil.

sliced pork in a skillet for 1–2 minutes to render the fat and make the slices crispy before placing 
on top of ramen. Use as many slices as you’d like to serve on your ramen—typical amounts vary from 1–3 slices. 
13 To assemble your bowl, add 1 cup (235 ml) piping hot Tonkotsu soup to your Shoyudare (Step 9) and 1 tablespoon of the Seabura (Step 10) to each serving portion, then add your noodles and place the sliced Chashu on top along with desired toppings.

combine any stock or fat to make a simple shoyu ramen. This recipe combines the stock, shoyudare, and fat into one. (Please see Rameducate Yourself on page 152 to learn about the three components of all ramen.) 
With this recipe, I’ve slow-cooked oxtail sections within my broth 
in a good crock pot, which helps render the fat from the bones without having to constantly stir. You could also make this in a slow cooker, large Dutch oven, or heavy-duty pot. The oxtail adds a meaty goodness and complexity to the fat component that complements the soy sauce. You’ll have to go to an Asian market to find dashi, or Japanese stock, which comes in granular form—there are many varieties to choose from, so just make sure to pick one that has bonito fish as the primary ingredient. It’s also important to have dried shiitake mushrooms, as they’ll give a more intense flavor to the soup than fresh ones. The final soup will taste overly salty, but when the noodles are added in, they will soak up the sauce and balance it out.level 2

(Text)1 In a crock pot, slow cooker, large Dutch oven, or heavy-duty pot, combine the bacon fat, carrots, 
onion, green onions, apple, celery, garlic, and dried shiitake mushrooms.
2 Add the whole chicken, oxtails, and lemon, then pour over the chicken stock, followed by the soy 
sauce, dashi, salt, pepper, and bay leaf—the stock should almost cover the chicken.
3 Set the crock pot or slow cooker to high and let cook for 10 hours. If using a large Dutch oven or pot, bring to a boil over a high heat and set in an oven preheated to 200ºF (90ºC) for 8–10 hours. When the oxtail meat easily falls off the bone, your soup is done.
4 With a slotted spoon, remove all of the larger solids and discard. Strain the remaining solids with a finer sieve into a large pot. You should have a light brown, glossy, and fat-rich soup. At this point the stock can be refrigerated for up to 2 weeks or frozen for 1 month.
5 In a separate saucepan, bring the Shoyu Base to a boil, then lower the heat and let simmer until it’s ready to serve. Use about 2 cups (475 ml) per serving. Right before serving, crank it back up to a boil.
6 Pour 2 cups soup (475 ml) over each bowl of noodles. Top each bowl with desired toppings. (See How to Build a Bowl of Ramen on page xi for help with timing the orchestration of your ramen components.)

(Text)Shio Base
If you’ve made my Tonkotsu Base (page 5), then you have a basic 
shiodare , or strong salt flavor base, with which you can combine any 
stock or fat to make a simple shio ramen. This recipe is a variation of shiodare but adds additional flavor so that you can simply combine it with a chicken or vegetable stock for a flavorful soup. (Please see Rameducate Yourself on page 152 to learn about the three components of all ramen.) 
This recipe starts off with the same components as the Miso Base 
(page 3), but I’ve added fresh and dried shiitake mushrooms to give 
it added depth. It also incorporates the nice fatty flavor of bacon fat. I experimented with different types of salt for this recipe to see which came through the best; I chose fleur de sel because I like the earthiness that it adds without it being overwhelmingly salty, and it helps keep the taste of the soup lingering on the palate. You can make your own original recipe with any special salt you have on hand.level 1

(Text)11 Ramen Soup Bases and Noodles1 In a food processor, combine the carrot, onion, green onions, apple, celery, garlic, and fresh shiitake 
mushrooms and process until very finely chopped, almost like a paste. It is better to use a food processor, but if you don’t have one, finely chop these ingredients by hand.
2 In a medium-sized pot, warm the bacon fat and sesame oil over medium-high heat. Add the finely chopped vegetables and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent and the apple is tender, 10–12 minutes. Add the dashi and fleur de sel, and mix well.
3 To make the broth, add the butter to a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Once the butter starts to brown and smells nutty, add the stock, mirin, kombu, and mushrooms. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and let simmer for at least 15 minutes, then remove solids with a sieve. Add the Shio Base to the broth (depending on the number of people you are serving, it’s 3 tablespoons Shio Base to every 1 cup/235 ml broth). Lower heat and let simmer until it’s ready to serve. Use about 2 cups (475 ml) soup per serving. Right before serving, crank the heat back up to boil.
4 Pour 2 cups (475 ml) soup over each bowl of noodles and add your desired toppings. (See How to Build a Bowl of Ramen on page xi for help with timing the orchestration of your ramen components.)

(Text)13 Ramen Soup Bases and NoodlesRamen Noodles 
There’s no getting around the fact that making every element of 
ramen from scratch is a lot of work. The good news is that almost all the components—the fat; the tare , or highly flavored season 
component; the broth; the toppings; and the noodles—can be made over the course of several days. If you make these ahead of time, then when you’re ready to assemble your ramen, it can be done relatively quickly. These noodles can be wrapped in individual portions and frozen for up to one month. You will need a pasta machine, and I’d recommend using an electric mixer with a dough hook, unless you want to develop Popeye forearms....
Remember, there are lots of other, easier noodle alternatives 
that are perfectly fine. Any of the following will work, just throw out 
those salty flavor packets:
• fresh noodles from a ramen shop 
• fresh packaged noodles that come with a soup-base packet 
• dried ramen noodles for instant ramen 
• dried chuka soba noodles ( chuka soba  actually translates to 
“Chinese noodle,” which are, in fact, ramen noodles)
• gluten-free packaged ramen noodles or rice ramen noodles  
for dietary restrictions
If you do venture down the homemade noodle path, then keep this 
in mind: a perfect noodle has a yellow hue, should be cooked al dente, and have a chewy and elastic, yet firm texture that holds up to the soup without getting soggy, all the way until the very last slurp. Leve L 3
Serves 8 
Prep time: 3 hours 
2 tsp “baked baking soda” (recipe on page 14) or kansui powder
11⁄4 cups (295 ml) water (if you are hand-kneading, change water 
quantity to 11⁄2 cups, or 355 ml)
31⁄2 cups (490 g) bread flour, plus extra for dusting
1⁄2 cup (60 g) cake flour
1 cup (150 g) wheat flour1 tbsp saltCornstarch, for dusting

(Text)1 In a small bowl, combine the baked baking soda or kansui powder and water until it dissolves. 
2 In a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the bread, cake, and wheat flours, kansui water, 
and salt. Mix for 10 minutes on the lowest speed until the dough forms little pellets. If you need to, add up to 5 additional teaspoons of water. The dough is ready when it still feels dry but comes together when squeezed with your hand. 
3 Tip the dough onto a floured board and knead into a ball for at least 10 minutes. Alternatively, you can put your dough in a plastic zip-top bag and form it into a ball so that it is easier to bring together and knead. 
4 When you are ready to make your pasta, set up your pasta machine so that it is stable and won’t slip from your work surface.
5 Cut your dough ball into 8 equal-sized pieces and use one piece at a time, keeping the rest wrapped tightly with plastic wrap or sealed in your zip-top bag and refrigerated. 
6 Roll out one piece until it resembles a flat, long shape. Sprinkle with some cornstarch so it doesn’t stick to the pasta maker. Pass it through your pasta maker on the largest setting—it will be a bit rough at the edges, but don’t worry about how it looks. Fold it over on itself and pass it through the machine again. 
7 Reduce the machine width to 2 and pass through. Fold it over on itself and pass it through again. 
8 Reduce the machine width to 4 and pass it through only once. You will now have one long strip of dough. Cut this strip in half vertically.
9 Reduce the machine width to 6 and pass through one of the halves twice. Repeat with the other half. Now your dough is ready to run through the noodle cutter attachment.
10 The two strips will yield enough noodles for 1 bowl of ramen. Repeat steps 6–8 for the remaining dough pieces from step 5. Sprinkle each batch of noodles with additional cornstarch, lifting up the noodles to separate and lightly coat them, then pack them individually in plastic wrap. Let them sit in the refrigerator for at least a day before using. If you are planning to use them later, put them in individual ziplock bags and store them in the freezer for up to one month. 
11 Cook the fresh pasta in a pot of boiling water. Depending on the number of portions, cook for  
1–2 minutes. Shake out all excess water and lay a portion in your bowl of hot soup by folding them over onto each other so they do not look messy. Then add the soup and toppings. 
How to Make “Baked Baking Soda”
Baked b aking soda replaces a Japanese ingredient known as kansui  that is often difficult to 
find and that gives ramen noodles their signature yellow hue and firmness. Harold McGee, 
the king of kitchen science, discovered that by baking baking soda, you could get the same effect as the kansui. Spread 
1⁄4 cup (55 g) baking soda on a foil-lined baking sheet and place 
it in an oven preheated to 275˚F (135˚C) for 1 hour. As this recipe only calls for 2 teaspoons, you can save the remainder in a zip-top bag. Just fold up the baking soda in the foil to make it easier to put in a storage bag.

(Text)Tamagoyaki (Japanese Omelet)
You will need a Japanese tamagoyaki  frying pan (it’s rectangular) 
to get a visually appealing omelet. If you don’t have one, a regular 
frying pan will work, but you won’t end up with the uniform rectangular shape that distinguishes this omelet.level 2
Makes enough for  
4 ramen portions
Prep time: 10 minutes
3 eggs
1 green onion, chopped 1 tsp shoyu (soy sauce) 1 tsp sugar
1⁄4 tsp salt
Nonstick cooking spray 
1 In a medium-sized bowl, whisk the eggs with the green onion, shoyu, sugar, and salt until foamy.
2 Over medium-high heat, warm 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a frying pan. Drip a tiny bit of egg in 
the pan—if it sizzles on contact, the pan is sufficiently hot. Add about a quarter of the egg mixture to the pan and tilt the pan so that the egg mixture covers the bottom in a thin, even layer. The egg will start cooking quickly so you’ll need to move fast.  
3 Using chopsticks, gently roll the egg mixture tightly toward you from the part of the pan farthest from the handle.
4 Quickly add a little more cooking spray to the exposed part of the pan.
5 Pour another quarter of the egg mixture into the pan, lifting up the cooked portion to get some egg mixture underneath it to cook. 
6 Roll the egg mixture away from you this time as it combines and attaches to the cooked egg layer. Nudge it to the back to the front of the pan, where you started before. 
7 Repeat two more times until you’ve used all of the egg—the omelet will obviously increase in size with each layer.
8 Roll the omelet out of the pan and you should have a rectangular-shaped block with your layers of egg. Let cool and slice vertically before serving.

Serves 12
Prep time: 30 minutesMenma (Seasoned Bamboo Shoots)
This is a popular topping for ramen, and there is a world of difference 
between fresh bamboo shoots and canned. If you can’t find fresh bamboo, I would forgo using it entirely. You can find fresh bamboo in most Asian grocery stores; you can recognize it by its signature conical shape.
1 lb (455 g) fresh bamboo shoots
1 tbsp sesame oil2 cups (475 ml) water3 tsp dashi granules 1 tbsp shoyu (soy sauce)1 tbsp sake2 tsp sugar1 tsp salt
1 Cut the bamboo shoots in half lengthwise and then into thin slices horizontally.
2 In a large sauté pan over medium-high heat, combine the sesame oil, water, dashi, shoyu, sake, 
sugar, and salt. Add the bamboo shoots. 
3 Heat, uncovered, until the bamboo has absorbed most of the liquid, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and store in an airtight container. Will keep for up to one week in the refrigerator or frozen for up to 1 month.

1 Fill a medium-sized pot with about 11⁄2 inches (3.5 cm) water and bring to a boil over high heat. 
Add the white vinegar or lemon juice—this will help the eggs to coagulate quicker and reduce the amount of feathering around the edges, but don’t add too much or the eggs will taste sour. Once the water comes to a boil, reduce to just above a simmer. 
2 Crack an egg into a small ramekin or cup. If poaching more than one egg, prepare up to 3 ramekins at a time—I don’t recommend cooking more than 3 at a time. 
3 Gently slide the eggs out of the ramekins and into the simmering water. Take care not to crowd the pan. 
4 Cook the eggs until the whites are opaque, about 31⁄2 minutes. 
5 With a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked eggs to a paper towel to drain. If not using immediately, store in a water bath in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 days.

(Text)Chashu (Braised Pork)
Chashu is one of the most popular ramen toppings. It can vary in 
flavor, size, and fat content—one ramen-ya might serve three thick, juicy pieces; another might give you two wafer-thin slices the size of half your bowl. Its origin, just like ramen, stems from the Chinese char-siu , roasted or barbecued pork. You may recognize char-siu 
by its signature red exterior and lean meat, but Japanese chashu is completely different. It’s not red, has more fat and tenderness, and is typically braised rather than barbecued. Braising calls for cooking it in liquid at low heat until the tough collagen in the meat breaks down. The result is a melt-in-your mouth experience. Chashu can be made from different cuts of pork and is traditionally tied so that it can be sliced into rounds.level 2
Serves 4–6, based on 
3 slices per serving
Prep time: 4 hours 
cooking time
2-lb (900 g) slab of pork shoulder or other part with fat, cut into  
4–5 inch (10–13 cm) wide pieces, rolled up into a nice round bundle, 
and tightly trussed with cooking string to keep its shape
21⁄2 qts or 10 cups (2.8 L) water 
1 qt or 41⁄4 cups (946 ml) dark shoyu (soy sauce)
21⁄2 cups (500 g) sugar
3⁄4 cup (175 ml) mirin (sweet rice wine) 
1 green onion, chopped 
1 tbsp grated ginger 
1 Combine the pork with the water, shoyu, sugar, mirin, onion, and ginger in a large pot over high 
heat. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook until the pork is tender, about 4 hours. Skim off any scum that floats to the surface. 
2 Remove the pork from the liquid. Insert a medium-thick wooden skewer into the center of the meat. If it comes out clean, the pork is done.
3 When you are ready to use it, take the pork out of the liquid. Save the liquid for Marinated Half-Cooked Eggs (page 26) or adding to your Shoyu Ramen Base—do not throw this away! Let the pork rest for at least 2 hours or overnight in the braising liquid in the refrigerator to make it easier to slice—overnight is best as the pork will continue to soak up the juices in that time. 
4 Sauté your sliced pork in a skillet for 1–2 minutes to render the fat and make the slices crispy before placing on top of ramen. Cut into 
1⁄4 inch (6 mm) thick rounds. Use as many slices as you’d 
like to serve on your ramen—typical amounts vary from 1–3 slices.

(Text)Roasted Nori (Seaweed)
These days you can find roasted and flavored seaweed in grocery 
stores, coffee shops, and even vending machines. I prefer to roast my own because some of the varieties out there are too oily or aren’t crunchy enough for me. If you purchase a pack of seaweed made for sushi in big sheets, you can roast them over an open gas flame in seconds. (Unfortunately, this can’t be done on an electric stove.) If you do it this way, I promise you’ll never go back to buying ready-roasted seaweed. It’s far tastier and crisper when you make it yourself.level 1
Makes 2 squares  
per portion 
Prep time: 2 minutes 
Japanese nori (seaweed) in sheets
Nonstick cooking spray or sesame oilSea salt or kosher salt
1 Spray both sides of each sheet of seaweed with cooking spray or wipe sesame oil over it using a 
folded paper towel.
2 Over a low flame on a gas stove, gently waft the seaweed back and forth on both sides until crisp.
3 Set the finished roasted seaweed sheet on a paper towel and repeat with additional sheets.
4 Sprinkle each sheet with salt and stack them about 4 or 5 high.
5 Cut each stack into quarters with a sharp chef’s knife or with kitchen shears.

(Text)25 Ramen ToppingsBeni Shoga (Pickled Ginger)
Most recipes for beni shoga  call for fresh shiso, but since store-
bought umeboshi vinegars tend to have shiso leaves in their liquid, 
I forgo using fresh shiso. What’s great is you can use the leftover umeboshi brine to complement any salad. This recipe is from a variation of the brine I use for bread and butter pickles. I love its sweet and sour balance with the subtleness of the sugar and extra zing from mustard seeds.level 1
Serves 30 
Prep time: 2 weeks 
6 oz (170 g) fresh ginger root (about 3 medium-
sized stalks)
1 cup (235 ml) umeboshi (pickled Japanese plum) 
vinegar *
2 tbsp salt
4 tbsp sugar4 tbsp mirin (sweet rice wine) 
1 tsp yellow mustard seeds
* you can purchase umeboshi vinegar at an Asian grocery 
store or online 
1 Peel the ginger and cut into 1⁄4-inch (6 mm) slices.  
2 In a small jar, combine the umeboshi vinegar, salt, sugar, mirin, and mustard seeds. Cover and 
shake to combine. 
3 Add the ginger to the jar, cover, and refrigerate for 2 weeks.
4 Remove the ginger slices from the brine and julienne into thin strips.

(Marinated Half-Cooked Egg)
I try to save time when it comes to cooking in my house, so this 
recipe is actually two. The ingredients I use to soak my half-cooked eggs in are the same as my mom’s recipe for teriyaki sauce. If you want to skip the teriyaki sauce step entirely, that’s fine, too. The other short cut: if you are making or plan to make Chashu (page 22) or Kakuni (page 28), you can use the braising liquid left over from that recipe to soak your eggs.level 2
Makes 6 eggs and  
2 cups (450 ml) 
teriyaki sauce
Prep time: 11⁄2 hours, 
plus 2 days to 
m a r i n a t e    
1 cup (235 ml) shoyu (soy sauce)
1 cup (200 g) sugar1
1⁄2 tsp grated ginger
1 tsp minced garlic
1⁄2 cup (120 ml) mirin (sweet rice wine)
6 eggs, at room temperature*
1⁄2 cup bonito fish flakes 
* Eggs should be brought to an even temperature in a warm bath before 
boiling so that cooking times do not vary. Also, poke a pin-sized hole in the bottom of the shells of the eggs for easy peeling later.

(Text)27 Ramen Toppings1 In a medium saucepan over high heat, whisk together the shoyu, sugar, ginger, and garlic in a 
medium saucepan. Once the mixture starts bubbling and the sugar dissolves, remove from the heat. Make sure it doesn’t bubble over. Stir in the mirin and cool to room temperature or refrigerate for  
at least 1 hour.
2 Bring a large pot of water to a boil. With a slotted spoon or a Chinese strainer, gently add the eggs to the boiling water, and immediately set a timer for 6
1⁄2 minutes.
3 While the eggs are cooking, prepare an ice-bath for them. When the eggs are done, immediately transfer them to the ice bath. Let them cool in the ice bath for about 10 minutes, then remove the eggs and peel them.
4 In a shallow container that is deep enough for the eggs to be covered in liquid, combine  
3 cups (700 ml) water and 1 cup (235 ml) teriyaki sauce, or 1 cup (235 ml) Chashu liquid (see page 22). Add your eggs; cover them with a paper towel by pressing the paper towel down so it’s touching the top of the eggs; and pour the bonito fish flakes over the paper towel—the weight of the paper towel will help the eggs marinate on all sides and the bonito flakes will flavor the eggs. Let marinate in the refrigerator for 2 days.
5 Remove the eggs from their soaking liquid and cut each one in half with a very sharp knife. You’ll end up with a beautiful half-cooked egg filled with liquid-gold goodness, ready to complete any ramen recipe!

(Text)Kakuni (Braised Pork Belly)
Kakuni  is a pork ramen topping, but it literally means “square 
simmered.” It’s cooked in a fashion similar to Chashu (page 22) 
but the pork is cut into squares before it is braised. When making kakuni, save the reserved braising liquid. It is a useful ingredient for Marinated Half-Cooked Eggs (page 26), or for combining with shiodare to make a very basic Shoyu Base (page 8).level 2
Serves 4–6, based on 
3 slices per serving 
Prep time: 4 hours

1 lb (455 g) boneless pork belly, cut into large

1 garlic clove
1 green onion, chopped1 tbsp grated ginger

(Text)Mayu (Black Garlic Oil)
Mayu is often used to add depth and flavor to ramen. It’s very bitter 
on its own but mixes well when used in small quantities. Because this recipe requires cooking the garlic until it’s charred and completely blackened, I use avocado oil for its high smoke point. Store in a plastic squeeze bottle and drizzle a small amount over the top of the ramen soup before serving.level 2
Makes 1⁄2 cup  
(120 ml), enough  
for 12 servings  
Prep time: 10 minutes
1⁄4 cup (60 ml) avocado oil 
8 garlic cloves, minced 
1⁄4 cup (60 ml) sesame oil
1 In a small saucepan over high heat, warm the avocado oil for about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and stir until it turns dark brown. Reduce the heat to medium and continue stirring occasionally until the garlic blackens. 
2 Transfer the mixture to a blender and add the sesame oil. Blend on high until well incorporated and smooth.

Many ramen shops offer fresh garlic cloves and a press at the table  
so you can squeeze the garlic right into your ramen. I prefer the 
subtler flavor of roasted garlic (plus I don’t like sweating garlic all day!). This butter adds flavor and richness to any ramen soup. It’s 
also delicious as a spread on bread or toast.level 2
Serves 4, based on  
1 tablespoon portions
Prep time:  
1 hour, 15 minutes 
1 garlic bulb
Salt and pepper, to season Olive oil, for drizzling
1⁄4 cup or 1⁄2 stick (55 g) unsalted butter,  
at room temperature
1 Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). 
2 Cut about 1⁄4-inch (6 mm) off the top of the garlic bulb to expose the tips of the cloves and place 
the garlic on a piece of aluminum foil.
3 Drizzle the bulb with olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and wrap with the foil to cover 
completely.
4 Place the wrapped garlic on a cookie sheet. Bake on the center rack for 1 hour, until the bulb starts popping out of its skin and is caramel in color. Feel free to peek in the oven to check. 
5 Remove from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes. Break apart the bulb and squeeze the garlic cloves out of their skins onto a cutting board. With the back of a knife or a fork, mash the cloves into a paste. 
6 Transfer to a small bowl and combine with the butter until well incorporated. Store in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 4 weeks. Bring to room temperature before using.

5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 Fill a small saucepan with about 1⁄2-inch (1.25 cm) olive oil and set over medium-high heat. Line a 
plate with a paper towel.
2 Add a single garlic slice to the hot oil. If it sizzles on contact, you’re ready to begin cooking. Add the garlic slices in 2 batches and cook just until lightly browned, 5–8 seconds. Watch carefully—these cook very fast and need to be removed promptly, or they will burn and taste very bitter.
3 With a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked garlic chips to the paper towel–lined plate and let cool before serving.

(Text)Fried String Potatoes
Called pommes pailles  by the French, these make a delicious 
topping for ramen. Unlike regular fried potatoes, they stay crisp for 
hours and you can keep them for up to 3 days—store them in an airtight container and re-crisp them in a toaster oven before use.level 1
Makes 8 portions,  
using a healthy pile  
per portion
Prep time: 10 minutes 2 cups (475 ml) vegetable oil, for frying 
1 russet potato, skin on, thinly sliced, preferably 
with a mandoline 
Salt, to season
1 Fill a large heavy-duty frying pan with 1⁄2-inch (1.25 cm) oil and set over medium-high heat. Line a 
plate with a paper towel. 
2 Add a potato strip to the hot oil. If it sizzles on contact, you’re ready to fry. Add small batches of 
potatoes to the hot oil and cook until browned and crisp, about 15 seconds. Watch closely—these can burn quickly. 
3 With a slotted spoon, transfer the crisped potatoes to the paper-towel-lined plate to cool. Repeat with the remaining batches. 
4 Lightly season with salt.

(Text)Kalua Pork and Cabbage Ramen
I was inspired with this recipe by my Auntie Claudie Naauao, who 
lives in Hawaii. She suggested that I make a kalua pork version of ramen. I love the smoky flavor of kalua pork and how its tender pieces easily shred into delicate strings that soak up the soup base.  
I would suggest that you use a slow cooker for this to make it easier. The braised cabbage and sweet sautéed apples make it a complete dish and the liquid smoke gives it an instant smoky flavor.level 1
Serves 6
Prep time: 5 hours, 
plus time to make 
Ramen Soup Base 
and Ramen Noodles 
(optional)
To Make in 
Advance
Miso Base (page 3) or 
your base of choice
Ramen Noodles  
(page 13)2 tbsp Hawaiian sea salt
11⁄2 lbs (670 g) pork shoulder
2 tbsp rendered bacon fat (any fat or oil can be substituted)2 tsp liquid smoke1 head cabbage, quartered (I prefer Napa cabbage)1 tbsp unsalted butter2 apples, peeled and diced1 tsp smoked paprika
Additional Toppings
6 green onions, chopped (1 tbsp per serving)
1 Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sea salt on each side of pork shoulder. In a slow cooker, add the bacon fat, set 
the pork shoulder on top, and pour the liquid smoke on top. Cover and cook for 3 hours on high. Add the cabbage and continue cooking until meat is tender and shreds easily, about 1 hour longer.
2 Transfer the pork to a cutting board and pull it into shreds with a fork. Transfer the cabbage to a bowl and discard the cooking juices; they will be too salty to use for anything.
3 In a medium frying pan over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the apples, sprinkle with paprika, and cook, stirring frequently until the apples are tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper.
4 Boil a pot of water for your noodles. In a separate saucepan, bring 21⁄4 cups (530 ml) Miso Base and 
12 cups (2.8 L) chicken or vegetable stock to a boil, then lower heat and let simmer until it’s ready to serve. Note: It’s 3 tablespoons of base to every 1 cup (235 ml) stock. Use about 2 cups (475 ml) soup per serving. Right before serving, crank it back up to boil.
5 Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as they’re done, drain well and separate into serving bowls.
6 Pour 2 cups (475 ml) soup over each bowl of noodles. Top each bowl with a small mound of shredded pork, cabbage, apple, and green onions.

(Text)Indonesian Pork Ramen with Coconut 
Curry Soup
The recipe for the pork marinade in this recipe is from my friend 
Elisabeth who was given it by someone she met while hiking in Indonesia. I am forever grateful, as it’s become a staple in my kitchen. This dish hits all the right notes—the aromatic flavors of the cumin, the sweetness of the bananas, the sliced tamagoyaki soaking up the coconut and curry broth, and the crunch of the fried string potatoes that stay crisp, even when drenched in soup. I usually marinate the pork and refrigerate it overnight to save time.level 1

(Text)41 Pork Ramen1 Set a large ziplock bag in a bowl to keep it steady, then add the lime juice, shoyu, maple syrup or 
brown sugar, garlic, cumin, curry, Sriracha or other chili paste, sesame oil, and peanut butter. Put the pork loin in the bag, seal it, and move the marinade around so that the pork loins are well coated. Refrigerate and leave to marinate for at least 3 hours or up to 24 hours.
2 Prepare a gas or charcoal grill for medium-high heat. Cook the pork loin over direct heat for about 10 minutes per side, rotating until the internal temperature reaches 145ºF (63ºC). Transfer the meat to a cutting board and let it rest for at least 8 minutes—the meat should be pink inside.
3 Boil a pot of water for your noodles. In a separate saucepan, bring 21⁄4 cups (530 ml) Shio Base and 
12 cups (2.8 L) chicken or vegetable stock to a boil. Whisk in the coconut milk and curry powder then reduce the heat and let simmer until ready to serve. Note: It’s 3 tablespoons of base to every 1 cup (235 ml) chicken or vegetable stock. Use about 2 cups (475 ml) soup per serving. Right before serving, crank it back up to a boil.
4 In a small sauté pan over medium-high heat, cook the butter until it begins to brown. Add the bananas and cook until lightly browned and starting to crisp, about 1 minute on each side.
5 Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as they’re done, drain well and separate into serving bowls.
6 Pour 2 cups (475 ml) soup over each bowl of noodles. Top each bowl with sliced pork, Japanese omelet, fried string potatoes, bananas, a little cilantro, and a segment of lime.

This porky ramen brings together two basic elements of the 
Japanese kitchen: tonkatsu , the breaded and fried cutlets that  
are so popular as a lunch dish and often included in bento boxes;  
and tonkotsu , the creamy white stock made from long-cooked  
pork bones, one of the classic bases for ramen.level 3

(Text)Ohayogozaimasu (Good Morning Ramen) 
Ramen for breakfast, why not? I often make scrambled eggs cooked 
in brown butter with crisped sage leaves in the morning, so why would those ingredients be any less delicious in a bowl of noodles? I like to cook bacon in the oven. There’s less mess to clean and the bacon ends up perfectly crisp. Just be sure to reserve the bacon fat; you’ll need it for many of my basic recipes.level 1

To Make in

Poached Egg (page 21)8 strips bacon (11⁄2 strips per serving)
1 bunch sage leaves
1⁄4 cup or 1⁄2 stick (55 g) unsalted butter
Additional toppings
1 bunch enoki mushrooms (small pile per serving)
1 avocado, sliced (3–4 slices per serving)1 tomato, diced (small pile per serving) 
1 Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC). Lay a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet. Spread the bacon 
strips on the sheet and bake for about 20 minutes. Watch carefully as time will vary with ovens. They will crisp up with no need to turn the pieces over. Save your bacon grease in a jar because you can use it to make the ramen soup bases. Remove from the oven and set on a paper towel.
2 Roll the sage leaves into a cigar shape and cut perpendicular to the roll into long strips, or a chiffonade.
3 Heat the butter in a small skillet over high heat until the butter starts to brown. Immediately scatter the sage leaves in the pan and cook for about 10 seconds. Turn the heat off and use a slotted spoon to remove the sage to a paper towel. Keep the browned butter to drizzle over the ramen.
4 Boil a pot of water for your noodles. In a separate saucepan, bring 21⁄4 cups (530 ml) Miso Base and 
12 cups (2.8 L) of broth to a boil, then lower the heat and let simmer until it’s ready to serve. Note: It’s 3 tablespoons of base to every 1 cup (235 ml) chicken or vegetable stock. Use about 2 cups (475 ml) soup per serving. Right before serving, crank it back up to boil.
5 Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as they’re done, drain well and separate into serving bowls.
6 Pour 2 cups (475 ml) soup over each bowl of noodles. Top each bowl with, mushrooms, avocado slices, tomatoes, poached egg, a crumbled up half strip of bacon, and crispy sage; lay another whole piece of bacon on the side. Drizzle the browned butter over the top for added flavor.

(Text)Ranch-Style Ramen
I learned to make this simple clear broth ramen from Sensei Rikisai 
at the Miyajima Ramen School in Osaka, Japan. It’s relatively quick to make compared to more traditional styles of ramen and the ingredients are not hard to find, yet it still has a deep flavor. It’s always a hit with my family. If you don’t have access to kombu, you could substitute wakame, kelp granules, or a teaspoon of fish stock. The flavor will be slightly different but it will still be delicious!level 2

1⁄2 lb (225 g) ground chicken
12 cups (2.8 L) water
4 pieces ginger (each 2 inches/5 cm long by 1⁄2 inch/  
6 mm wide), roughly cut on the diagonal, skin on
4 green onions (use the green part chopped large for 
soup and the white part for topping)
1 large rectangular piece kombu (about 10 inches/

1 In a large wok or stock pot, combine the ground pork and chicken with your hands. Add the water, 
a little at a time, squeezing the meat together and breaking up the fibers and fat until you get a sort of watery mush. You may want to wear disposable gloves to handle the raw meat.
2 Add the ginger, green onions, kombu, and shiitake mushrooms.
3 Turn heat to high. While the soup is coming to a boil, continue to stir with a large rubber spatula, picking up the mixture from the bottom and swiping the sides so that the meat does not stick. Stir frequently until the mixture comes to a boil and all of the meat has started to cook and the liquid is turning clear. This will take about 10 minutes. After the liquid turns clear, keep at a little bit above a simmer for another 30 minutes.
4 Drain the pork and chicken from the soup—once to get all of the larger pieces out with a thicker sieve and the second with a very fine sieve to get the remaining pieces out. For the second drain, return the soup to the wok and boil, then turn down to a simmer. Right before serving, crank it back up to a boil.

(Text)5 Prepare your chashu by frying quickly in a pan on both sides for 1–2 minutes to render the fat and 
make it crispy. Keep it ready to reheat right before placing on top of the ramen.
6 Pour 11⁄2 cups (360 ml) soup into each serving bowl. Season individual bowls with salt, rather than 
the entire pot, to keep flavors consistent. Season until it’s just a bit too salty because when added to the ramen, the noodles and extra water will take some of the salt taste away and balance it out.
7 Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as they’re done, drain well and separate into the seasoned serving bowls.
8 Squeeze out the excess water from white parts of green onions and place a small mound on top. Also add the sliced chashu.

(Text)51 Chicken RamenOven-Broiled Karaage Curry Ramen
There are few foods I find more comforting than fried chicken—it 
ranks among my top five favorite foods in the world. Karaage  is the 
Japanese version of fried chicken and I would eat it every day if I could. Since that just wouldn’t be healthy, for this recipe, I cheat a bit and cook it in the oven. The chicken ends up wonderfully crisp and I don’t have to deal with a pot of hot oil. The Golden Curry—a rich, thick, and instant curry that I add to the Miso Base—doesn’t drench the karaage so it maintains its crunch. It’s all the pleasure without the guilt.level 2

(Text)1 Add the shoyu, sugar, garlic, and ginger to a small saucepan and bring to boil. Once boiling, remove 
from the heat and add the mirin. Let cool to room temperature.
2 Rinse and pat dry the chicken thighs and cut each piece into bite-size pieces.
3 Add the chicken to a medium-sized bowl and cover with the marinade. Refrigerate and let marinate for at least 1 hour.
4 Heat the sesame oil in a medium-sized skillet on medium-high heat. Add the red onion and sauté until it starts to get charred around the edges. Set aside.
5 Set the oven rack at the top of the oven and preheat the broiler.
6 Drain the excess marinade from the bowl of chicken and sprinkle the chicken with cornstarch until all the pieces are liberally covered.
7 Place the chicken, so that no pieces are touching, on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
8 Broil for about 6 minutes, then flip and broil for an additional 5 minutes or until they are crispy and brown. Watch closely so they do not burn, as ovens will vary.
9 Set the chicken on a wire rack to cool.
10 Boil a pot of water for your noodles. In a separate saucepan, combine 21⁄4 cups (530 ml) Miso Base,  
12 cups (2.8 L) of chicken or vegetable stock and 6 Golden Curry boullion squares to a boil, then lower the heat and let simmer until it’s ready to serve. Note: It’s 3 tablespoons base to every 1 cup (235 ml) chicken or vegetable stock. Use about 2 cups (475 ml) soup per serving. Right before serving, crank it back up to boil.
11 Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as they’re done, drain well and separate into serving bowls.
12 Pour 2 cups (475 ml) soup over each bowl of noodles. Top with 3 pieces of chicken karaage, sautéed red onions, lettuce, marinated half-cooked egg, and garlic chips. Sprinkle with roasted sesame seeds and slip 2 nori squares into the broth. Right before serving, squeeze some lemon juice over the top.

delicious Geng Gari Gai—a traditional dish from Southern Thailand with aromatic chicken and curry. Though I didn’t have access to all the same ingredients that we had in Thailand, I was able to make a delicious soup using produce and seasonings found closer to home and combined it with my Shio Base.level 2

(Text)1 Heat the peanut oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and shallots 
and sweat for 2 minutes. Turn heat down to medium and add the chilies, red pepper, and eggplant. Continue to stir for 3–4 minutes until the eggplant starts to soften. Remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl.
2 In the same skillet or wok, heat the coconut cream, salt, pepper, turmeric, coriander, cumin, cloves, ginger, and lemongrass paste over low heat. Season the chicken, add it to the pan, and turn the heat to high. Then reduce the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook for about 15 minutes.
3 Add in the fish sauce, juice of 1⁄2 lime, brown sugar, and chicken stock. Simmer for an additional  
10 minutes. Reserve 1 cup (235 ml) of curry sauce from the pan to use separately with your  
Shio Base.
4 Add the bowl of garlic, shallots, chilies, red pepper, and eggplant to the mixture and continue  
to simmer until ready to serve.
5 Boil a pot of water for your noodles. In a separate large pot, start preparing the stock for your Shio Base. To your 12 cups (2.8 L) chicken stock, whisk in 1
1⁄2 cups (360 ml) Shio B ase. Then whisk  
in the 1 cup (235 ml) curry sauce that you reserved from the pan. Heat this up to boil, then lower the heat and let simmer until ready to use. Right before serving, crank it back up to boil.
6 Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as they’re done, drain well and separate into serving bowls.
7 Pour 2 cups (475 ml) soup over each bowl of noodles. Top with a generous helping of chicken, vegetables, and curry, and garnish with basil and a lime segment.

(Text)Chicken Meatball Ramen
My husband is Jewish so I’ve become pretty familiar with the light 
texture and fluffiness of a good matzah ball. I wanted to make a chicken meatball that’s equally light and delicious so I borrowed the technique of adding club soda and whipped egg whites to the meat mixture. The Shio Base gives it the perfect balance of saltiness and the golden yolk of the poached egg mixes in to bring the “chicken and the egg” together again.level 2

(Text)57 Chicken Ramen1 Using a mixer or a whisk, whip the egg whites until soft peaks form.
2 In a medium-sized bowl, combine the chicken, carrot, mushrooms, mint, sugar, shoyu, seltzer, onion 
powder, garlic salt, and pepper until well combined.
3 Gently fold in the breadcrumbs and the egg whites until just combined. Let the mixture rest for  
10 minutes.
4 In a large pot, start preparing the broth for your Shio Base. Combine the chicken or vegetable stock with butter, mirin, kombu, and mushrooms. Bring this to a low boil.
5 Make about 24 golf-ball-sized balls with the chicken mixture, enough for 2 per servings. The trick is to not overhandle the mixture, just gently scoop out and make them as quickly as possible, being careful not to squeeze at all when forming them. Wth a slotted spoon, drop them right into the stock you’ve prepared and cook in batches for about 6 minutes, uncovered.
6 Boil a pot of water for your noodles. Remove the chicken meatballs from your broth, take out the kombu and dried mushrooms and add your 2
1⁄4 cups (530 ml) Shio Base to the broth. It’s 3 tablespoons 
of base for every 1 cup (235 ml) of stock. Heat this back up to a boil, then lower the heat and let simmer until ready to use. Right before serving, crank it back up to boil.
7 Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as they’re done, drain well and separate into serving bowls.
8 Pour 2 cups (475 ml) soup over each bowl of noodles. Top each bowl with 4 meatballs, a small mound of daikon radish shoots, sweet red pepper, and a poached egg.

(Text)Ginger Chicken Ramen
It’s definitely not for everyone, but when ginger shines as the star 
flavor of a dish, I’m a fan. You can increase or reduce the amount as you please but you know where I stand. The crispy green beans, just-cooked shoyu egg scramble, and shredded carrots balance  
the intensity of the ginger, especially when mixed into the soup.  
It’s always easiest to freeze your ginger before grating.level 1

9 Right before you are about to pour the soup in your bowls, you’ll need to make your shoyu egg scramble. In a small bowl, combine the eggs, shoyu, and sugar. Beat well.
10 Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a medium skillet over high heat. When the butter starts to brown, pour in your beaten eggs and very quickly mix around with chopsticks.
11 When the eggs are barely cooked, remove from the pan and set in a bowl—they should be somewhat runny.
12 Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as they’re done, drain well and separate into serving bowls.
13 Pour 2 cups (475 ml) soup over each bowl of noodles. Top each bowl with a large mound of shredded ginger chicken, shredded carrots, shoyu egg scramble, and roasted sesame seeds.

(Text)Teriyaki Beef-Wrapped Asparagus 
Ramen 
When I was a kid, my mom made beef-wrapped asparagus 
appetizers whenever she hosted fancy parties. I felt so grown-up eating them and I loved how perfectly bite-sized they were. Now, I think they’re the perfect addition to elevate any ramen. I found some sweet Momotaro tomatoes at a farmers’ market in Santa Barbara and added them in for a pretty pop of color. You can add  
any fresh vegetables that you feel would complement it as well.level 2

1 Cut the raw beef slices in half and roll each asparagus spear in 1⁄2 slice of beef, pressing the meat 
around asparagus so that it is tightly rolled and stays secure.
2 In a small bowl, combine the shoyu, sugar, ginger, and garlic. Whisk to combine.
3 Heat 1 teaspoon sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the rolled beef and 
asparagus and cook for about 5 minutes, turning throughout until all sides are lightly browned.

(Text)4 Pour the sauce mixture over the beef and asparagus and turn to coat. Remove and set onto a plate, 
then pour the remaining sauce over the top. When cool, slice each spear in half diagonally.
5 In the same skillet you used to brown the beef and asparagus, heat 1 teaspoon of sesame oil over high heat. Add the bok choy and quickly cook on both sides until tender, about 2 minutes. Remove and season with a sprinkle of sea salt.
6 Boil a pot of water for your noodles. In a separate saucepan, bring 21⁄4 (530 ml) cups Miso Base and 
12 cups (2.8 L) broth to a boil, then lower the heat and let simmer until it’s ready to serve. Note: It’s 3 tablespoons of base to every 1 cup (235 ml) chicken or vegetable broth. Use about 2 cups (475 ml) soup per serving. Right before serving, crank it back up to a boil.
7 Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as they’re done, drain well and separate into serving bowls.
8 Pour 2 cups (475 ml) soup over each bowl of noodles. Top each bowl with 4 halved slices of beef-wrapped asparagus, a small bunch of bok choy, 2 tomato slices, a pile of fried string potatoes, and a marinated half-cooked egg. Tuck 2 squares of nori into the soup, then sprinkle some roasted sesame seeds over for garnish.

(Text)65 Beef RamenKobe Beef Tsukemen
Kobe beef, the delicious and tender well-marbled beef from Kobe,  
a city in Japan’s Hyogo prefecture, isn’t exactly something you find 
at your grocery store every day, but when you do stumble across it, treat yourself to something divine. The real highlight of this dish is the style of this ramen. It’s prepared as a tsukemen , where you 
drench your separated noodles into a flavor-rich warm soup. Look out for the pieces of kobe that come with a little square of beef suet, or beef fat. You can melt the suet and sear the meat in it for additional flavor and umami.level 1

(Text)1 In a small bowl, whisk the lemon juice, shoyu, sake, and mirin to make a marinade.
2 Sprinkle the steak with salt and pepper.
3 Melt the suet in a medium-sized skillet over high heat. Add the steak and quickly sear on both 
sides, until just cooked, leaving the meat rare in the center.
4 Add the marinade to coat and remove the steak from the pan to rest, leaving the juices in the pan.
5 Reduce the marinade and pan juices for about 1 minute in the skillet.
6 Boil a pot of water for your noodles. In a separate saucepan, bring 4 cups (946 ml) Shoyu Base to a boil. Add the remaining cooking marinade and pan juices from the steak and whisk in the horseradish, then lower the heat and let simmer until it’s ready to serve. Use 1 cup (235 ml) soup per serving. Right before serving, crank it back up to boil.
7 Cut the steak into small squares—the meat should be on the rare to medium-rare side.
8 Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as they’re done, drain well and separate into serving bowls.
9 Add 1⁄2 of one cubed steak to the serving bowls. Top with a quail egg, mound of daikon, a mint 
leaf, a thin slice of lemon, and a dollop of roasted garlic butter. Serve the soup in a separate bowl for dipping.

(Text)1 Make the cooking liquid by whisking the shoyu, sugar, mirin, sake, garlic, and ginger together 
until combined.
2 Warm the liquid in a medium-sized skillet over a high heat. When it reaches a boil, turn down to medium-high heat and add the carrot, daikon radish, red pepper, cabbage, and mushrooms. Cook for 5 minutes, then remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
3 Next cook the tofu for an additional 5 minutes. Remove it and set aside.Sukiyaki Ramen
I love everything about sukiyaki —traditionally wafer-thin beef, 
served hot pot style by simmering with vegetables, tofu, and a jelly-type noodle, and often dipped in raw egg. Here, I’ve added quail eggs as a topping, in case you find a raw egg is too much. It cooks really quick so just make sure you have all of your other components ready to go.level 1

(Text)4 Season the beef, then add it and cook it very quickly. Leave it as rare as possible; the heat of the ramen 
soup will continue to cook it so it’s ok if it’s redder than is usually safe. Remove it and set aside.
5 Boil a pot of water for your noodles. In a separate saucepan, bring 11⁄2 cups (360 ml) Miso Base and 
8 cups (1.8 L) broth to a boil. Add the remaining cooking liquid from the sukiyaki to your soup base, then lower the heat and let simmer until it’s ready to serve.

This recipe was created by my friend Emily Lai. This is a staple of 
Malaysian cuisine and stems from the basic ingredients of fresh roots and coconut milk. It shouldn’t be too difficult to find dried shrimp, just look for fresh ones that are bright pink, coral-colored, and whole, as opposed to brown and falling apart.level 3

(Text)1 Prepare the laksa paste by blending the turmeric, ginger, shallots, garlic, dried chilies, red chilies, 
cashews, dried shrimp, coriander, and lemongrass together in a food processor or blender until it turns into a paste.
2 In a medium pot with a lid, bring the water and a pinch of salt to a boil. Add the chicken breast, and when the water returns to a boil, cover and let the chicken steep in the hot water for 20 minutes. Do not open the lid.
3 Remove the chicken then return the water to a boil and add the shrimp. Cook for 5 minutes, then remove and let cool.
4 Add reserved shrimp shells and heads to the cooking liquid. Let simmer for 10 minutes, then strain out all solids.
5 Add 3⁄4 cup (175 ml) Shio Base and simmer for another 10 minutes.
6 Boil a large pot of water for your noodles.
7 Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the laksa paste and sauté until the oil starts to separate. Reserve a few tablespoons for your topping.
8 Add the coconut milk to your Shio soup infused with chicken and shrimp and bring it to a boil. Check for seasoning to see if more salt needs to be added.
9 Blanch the mung bean sprouts in the same ramen noodle water for 30 seconds and set aside.
10 Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as they’re done, drain well and separate into serving bowls.
11 Pour 2 cups (475 ml) soup over each bowl of noodles. Top with blanched bean sprouts, hard-boiled egg, green beans, chili, mint, and a spoonful of the reserved laksa paste. Garnish with a lime wedge. If desired, top with chicken and shrimp meat.

Another great recipe that Emily Lai and I developed together! 
Although born in Malaysia, Emily now lives in San Francisco, where she operates The Rib Whip, a Southern BBQ truck, and a Malaysian pop-up called Masak | Masak. We had so much fun experimenting with different combinations for this Louisiana-style ramen. I was pleasantly surprised to be able to find all of the ingredients in my local grocery stores.level 3

(Text)77 Seafood Ramen1 De-shell the crawfish, saving the shells for step 2 and setting the meat aside for topping the soup.
2 Fill a large pot with the water and add the crawfish shells, salt, black pepper, coriander, cloves, 
cayenne, paprika, oregano, thyme, lemon (squeeze in juice and add halves), onion, and garlic. Bring to a boil over high heat for about 30 minutes. Save the stock for later use.
3 Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, and celery (or what is called the “holy trinity”) and let sweat for 10 minutes. Place in a bowl and set aside.
4 In the same saucepan used above, heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the sliced sausage and cook through, turning throughout, for about 5 minutes until browned.
5 Boil a pot of water for your noodles. In a separate large saucepan, combine 5 cups (1.2 L) Shoyu Base to 3 cups (700 ml) crawfish shell stock to 1
1⁄2 cups (360 ml) holy trinity (step 3) and bring to a 
boil, then lower the heat and let simmer until you are ready to serve. Right before serving, crank  it back up to a boil.
6 De-shell the crawfish when they are cooled and set aside.
7 Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as they’re done, drain well and separate into serving bowls.
8 Pour 2 cups (475 ml) soup over each bowl of noodles. Top each bowl with a small pile of crawfish, holy trinity, sausage, green onions, lemon zest, and a sprinkle of file powder. Garnish with a crawfish head.

(Text)1 In a large pot, bring the chicken stock, 11⁄2 cups (360 ml) Shio Base, ham hock, and cabbage to a boil. 
Simmer for 1 hour so that the soup can absorb the flavors of the ham hock and cabbage.
2 Lightly salt both sides of the sea bass and immerse in the soup. Cook for 5–7 minutes to poach. 
Remove the fish and set aside.
3 Strain the ham hock and the cabbage out of the soup and discard. Bring the liquid to a boil, then lower the heat and let simmer until you are ready to serve.
4 Heat the sesame oil in medium skillet and sauté the snap peas for about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and remove from the heat.Egg Drop Ramen
This is another recipe that I developed with help from my friend Emily Lai. Emily was born in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and raised in the restaurant business. She generously shared her method for making traditional egg drop soup as the base for this ramen. She published the original in Vogue  magazine, so this is something special.level 3

(Text)Crispy Soft Shell Crab Ramen
One of my all-time favorite foods is fried soft-shell crab with its 
crispy delicate legs and the fact that you can eat the entire body, bite after juicy bite. They are way less work than a hard-shell crab and, in my opinion, even tastier. Most Asian food markets carry them frozen, so there should be no problems finding them in the off-season. I like to cook these under the broiler, and have found that as long as you remove and press out any excess water from the crabs before dredging them with katakuriko  or cornstarch,  
they cook up perfectly golden.level 2

1 cup (235 ml) yuzu citrus juice (you can 
substitute lime juice; 2 tbsp per serving)
1 Set the oven rack to 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) from the heating element and preheat the broiler.
2 Gently squeeze out any water from the soft-shell crabs and dab lightly with a paper towel. Lightly 
dredge the soft-shell crabs on both sides with cornstarch and place on a lined cookie sheet.
3 Spray the crabs with nonstick cooking spray on both sides. Broil for about 5 minutes, then flip and broil for an additional 5 minutes or until they are crispy and brown. Watch closely so they do not burn, as ovens will vary.
4 Boil a pot of water for your noodles. In a separate saucepan, bring 12 cups (2.8 L) Shoyu Base to a boil, then lower the heat and let simmer until it’s ready to serve. Right before serving, crank it back up to a boil.

(Text)Furikake Salmon Ramen
This recipe is great because if you don’t have the ramen soup base or 
fresh ramen noodles ready, you can eat the salmon on its own with some rice and a vegetable. I happen to love the salmon on ramen because the furikake  condiment adds an additional crunchy texture 
and flavor.level 1

Cooked Egg (page 26)24 oz (680 g) salmon fillet, skin on (ask for 
thickest part)
1⁄4 cup (60 g) mayonnaise (I prefer Japanese 
mayonnaise that you can find at Japanese 
grocers)
1 tbsp shoyu (soy sauce)
1 tsp sesame oil (I prefer the Kadoya brand 
because it is very strong)
1⁄4 cup (26g) furikake (Japanese condiment 
made from sesame seeds, seaweed, and salt)
Additional Toppings
11⁄2 cups (105 g) mushrooms, julienned (I prefer 
shiitake; 1⁄4 cup/17 g per serving)
3⁄4 cup (40 g) chives, chopped (2 tbsp per 
serving)
11⁄2 lemons, quartered (1 quarter per serving) 
1 Set the oven to broil. Place the salmon, skin side down, on a baking sheet lined with foil or a 
non-stick liner. In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, shoyu, and sesame oil.
2 Using a spatula, evenly spread the mixture in a thin layer over the salmon.
3 Evenly sprinkle furikake over the salmon to lightly coat it.
4 Broil the salmon for about 8 minutes, or until just done; this varies depending on the thickness  
of the fillet (do not overcook).
5 Remove from the broiler and slice into 4 even portions, about 11⁄2 inches (4 cm) wide. Remove the 
salmon skin.
6 Boil a pot of water for your noodles. In a separate saucepan, bring 12 cups (2.8 L) Shoyu Base to  
a boil, then lower the heat and let simmer until it’s ready to serve. Right before serving, crank it back up to boil.

(Text)Sweet Chili Salmon Ramen
The salmon on its own is one of my mom’s favorite dishes, which I 
make for her every time she visits. I thought it would be great on ramen because the extra-crispy salmon skin gives it texture and it goes well with broccoli and broccolini. The tenderness of a freshly made menma or seasoned and simmered bamboo shoots, perfectly steamed broccoli drizzled with sesame oil and a swirl of roasted garlic butter make this one of my favorites, too.level 2

4 Remove the salmon and face skin side up on a cutting board. Gently remove the skin by running  
a knife along the underside of the skin and the salmon and return the skin to the pan. Fry it over high heat on both sides for about 2 minutes until it gets crispy. Remove and set on a paper towel.
5 To the same pan, add the shoyu, sweet chili sauce, and sesame oil and combine over medium heat until sauce bubbles.

(Text)California Ramen
Being a California native, I love the fresh, accessible ingredients 
found in a California roll. During crab season, our family always eats a ton of fresh Dungeness crabs and if you have access to any, this recipe is pretty simple to pull together. Most grocery stores carry cooked Alaskan king crab legs that you can take home and crack open—no fuss. I’ve recommended the Shoyu Base here as I think  it best complements the seafood, but again, use whatever you have on hand or have decided to make. This recipe can be made in  
20 minutes, but the speed of this is down to the additional toppings and the base, noodles, and eggs being prepped ahead of time.level 2

20 minutes, plus 
time to make Ramen 
Soup Base, Ramen 
Noodles (optional),

Shichimi togarashi (Japanese mixed chili pepper 
spice), optional
1 Crack the crab and set aside.
2 Boil a pot of water for your noodles. In a separate saucepan, bring 12 cups (2.8 L) Shoyu Base to a 
boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer until it’s ready to serve. Right before serving, crank it back up to a boil.
3 In a small saucepan, heat the olive oil and butter, then add the garlic and squeeze the lemon over it. Cook until just sizzling.
4 Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as they’re done, drain well and separate into serving bowls.

(Text)91 Spicy RamenSpicy Base
I most often use this spicy base with the Miso Base (page 3), but it 
can be used with any base to add a rich and spicy complexity that isn’t mouth-numbing but definitely gives it a nice kick. Add more or less of it depending on how spicy you like your ramen.level 1
Serves 6
Prep time: 20 minutes
16 small shishito peppers, whole (you can 
substitute 3 green bell peppers, seeded)
2 green chili peppers, seeded and quartered
2 tsp red pepper flakes
1⁄2 cup (120 ml) sesame oil
1 In a blender, combine the green bell peppers, green chili peppers, and red pepper flakes. Slowly 
add in the sesame oil to emulsify.
2 Add 1⁄2 cup (120 ml) of Spicy Base for each 2-cup (475-ml) serving to any Ramen Soup Base.

(Text)Chorizo Miso Ramen
The inspiration for this chorizo-infused miso base came to me when 
I was standing in line with my sister Kathleen at La Super Rica Taqueria, the Santa Barbara taco stand made famous by Juila Child.  
I was excited to discover how well the chorizo blended into the soup base. Then I added more spicy chorizo on top. The result is a vibrant, full-flavor Mexican take on ramen.level 2

5 Boil a pot of water for your noodles. In a separate saucepan, bring 21⁄4 cups (530 ml) Miso Base and  
12 cups (2.8 L) broth to a boil. Add 6 tablespoons of cooked chorizo to your soup, then lower the heat and let simmer until you are ready to serve. Note: It’s 3 tablespoons of base to every 1 cup (235 ml) chicken or vegetable stock. Use about 2 cups (475 ml) soup per serving. Right before serving, crank it back up to a boil.
6 Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as they’re done, drain well and separate into serving bowls.
7 Pour 2 cups (475 ml) soup over each bowl of noodles. Top each bowl with a small mound of corn and chorizo; raw kale; about 
1⁄4 cup (40 g) of the onion, pepper, chili mixture; radishes; and a poached egg.

(Text)Spicy Pork Tantanmen
On my ramen tour of Tokyo, I was taken to LaShowHan for 
tantanmen . The name translates to “red hot chili noodle,” and the 
dish is a Japanese adaptation of a Szechuan-style spicy noodle dish known as Dan Dan noodles. I ordered a spectacular mazemen  
(brothless) style premium tantanmen with the perfect amount of heat—not too overpowering but with just enough kick to remind you of what it is. Without a heavy soup, the flavors of the individual spices stood out. The owner, Kenichi Okada, even took a selfie with our group. It’s one of my favorite souvenirs from the trip. His tantanmen is the inspiration for this recipe, so I’ve tried to make my best Kenichisan, but if you want the real deal, you’ll have to visit his shop in Tokyo (page 157).level 2

3 Purée the pepper in a food processor or a blender. Set aside.
4 Heat the sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat.
5 Add the ground pork and cook until no longer pink, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Remove the pork and pulse in a food processor until it becomes a fine mince.
6 Warm the chili oil in the wok at medium-high heat and add the minced pork.
7 Stir in the salt, sugar, shoyu, chili paste, sesame paste, and ground peppercorns and fry until all of the aromatics combine.
8 Boil a pot of water for your noodles. Add in the chicken stock, bring to a boil and turn down to simmer for 10 minutes to absorb all of the spices. Stock should evaporate a little and the sauce will be thick.
9 Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as they’re done, drain well and separate into serving bowls.
10 Pour 3⁄4 cup (175 ml) of the sauce into a bowl, top with noodles and garnish with green onions, 
peanuts, daikon radish sprouts, a drizzle of sesame oil, and chili paste.

My mom always served nasubi , or Japanese eggplant, in  
the most appealing way, leaving the stem intact and slicing 
through the flesh so that it fanned out on the plate. I love

2 tsp grated ginger (1⁄2 tsp per serving)
2 green onions, chopped (1 tsp per serving)
1 Cut the eggplant lengthwise in 1⁄4-inch (6 mm) strips, leaving the stem on so that they can  
fan out. Lightly season both sides.
2 In a small bowl, combine the shoyu, mirin, rice wine vinegar, and sugar. Whisk to combine.
3 Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the eggplant, fanning  
each one out so they are lying flat and none are touching. Cook for about 3 minutes on each  
side until they are lightly browned and the meat has softened. Repeat until all the eggplant  
is cooked.
4 Pour the sauce mixture over the eggplant and turn to evenly coat. Remove the eggplant and set 
onto a plate; pour the remaining sauce over the top.

(Text)Kabocha Ramen
Kabocha ranks among my favorite winter Japanese squash. It has a 
rich and nutty flavor and because the skin is edible when cooked, there’s no peeling required. In this ramen, the bitterness and  
spice of the mizuna lettuce balances the sweetness of the squash  to deliver a nice balance. Since the kabocha is steeped in shoyu, the Shoyu Base goes perfectly and the fried shiso leaf gives it a surprise crunch to start your first bite.level 3

1 Cut the kabocha in half and remove the seeds with a spoon. Save one half for later. Cut the  
stem and bottom off of the remaining half and cut into 11⁄2-inch (4 cm) cubes. No need to take  
the skin off.
2 In a medium skillet, whisk the shoyu, salt, dashi, sugar, mirin, and water. Bring to a boil and 
then reduce to simmer.
3 Add the kabocha in one layer so that each piece is touching the sauce. The sauce should almost cover the kabocha.

(Text)4 Simmer, uncovered, until the kabocha is soft, approximately 45 minutes. Turn each piece over 
halfway through cooking. When finished, the liquid should be almost gone.
5 Make a tempura batter out of the egg, cold water, and flour. Add 1⁄2-inch (6 mm) oil to a medium 
skillet on medium-high heat. Dip the shiso leave(s) into the batter mixture one at a time. When a little flour thrown in starts to sizzle, fry the shiso leaves, making sure they do not touch each other in the pan. Fry on both sides for about 10 seconds each, then set on a paper towel to remove excess oil until ready to use.
6 Boil a pot of water for your noodles. In a separate saucepan, bring 12 cups (1.8 L) Shoyu Base to a boil, then lower the heat and let simmer until you are ready to serve. Use about 2 cups (475 ml) soup per serving. Right before serving, crank it back up to a boil.

Hello fellow fungi lovers! With so many Japanese mushrooms to choose 
from, just go with whatever is fresh for the season. The only mushrooms I wouldn’t recommend here are matsutake mushrooms because of their high cost and strong flavor. If you are lucky enough to get your hands on those, make a dish where they are the highlight; in this dish, any other mushroom varieties works, so pick four of your favorites.level 2

(Text)Crispy Greens Ramen
I am a big fan of Swiss chard, kale, and Brussels sprouts but I  
love them even more when they are cooked crisp in the oven.  
They stay surprisingly crunchy in this ramen and even when  
they sink into the coconut-and-fish-sauce-infused Shio Base, the  
little nooks of the leaves fill with deliciousness and leave you so 
satisfied. The healthy greens really balance out the richness of  
the coconut milk.level 2

(Text)Cold Noodle Broth
My brother-in-law, Victor, got this recipe from his uncle who runs a 
small restaurant in Yokohama, Japan. The broth is very strong, so use it sparingly. It’s more like a flavorful sauce than a soup, so don’t over-serve this one. It’s super simple and perfect for a nice hot day.level 1
Serves 6
Prep time: 30 minutes
31⁄2 cups (350 ml) water
11⁄2 cups (150 g) sugar (I prefer baker’s sugar as 
it’s finer and dissolves quicker)
11⁄2 cups (350 ml) mirin (rice wine vinegar)
1⁄2 cup (120 ml) shoyu (soy sauce)
Sesame oil
1 In a medium pot over medium-high heat, add the water, sugar, vinegar, and shoyu. Mix well until the sugar dissolves.
2 Remove from the heat and let cool before using the broth.
3 Right before serving, add a couple of drops of sesame oil to each serving. Serve over cold noodles with your toppings of choice.

Tsukemen  refers to a dish of noodles that are served separately and

Hiyashi Chuka Ramen means “Chilled Chinese Ramen,” but as with 
many Chinese dishes, the Japanese have made their own version. This refreshing ramen-type salad with cold broth is normally served in the summer, with its colors speaking to what’s in season. There are all kinds of variations of this, so feel free to substitute with what you have fresh on hand for your own version.level 1

(Text)Slow-Roasted Tomato and Miso 
Spinach Chilled Ramen
The tender and herb-laden slow-roasted tomatoes really are the  
star of this dish. The spinach is reminiscent of traditional Japanese 
goma-ae , made by coating spinach with sesame paste. These, 
coupled with a poached egg and the Cold Noodle Broth, make a rewarding lunch after a big morning workout.level 2

Poached Egg (page 21)1⁄2 cup (120 ml) olive oil
2 sprigs fresh rosemary, chopped
2 sprigs thyme, chopped1 tsp salt
1⁄8 tsp white pepper
21⁄2 lbs (1.1 kg) tomatoes, stems removed and halved horizontally
3 tsp sesame oil, divided1 lb (455 g) baby spinach leaves, washed and dried1 tbsp sesame paste or tahini2 tbsp shoyu (soy sauce)2 tbsp mirin (sweet rice wine)
Additional toppings
2 cups (100 g) bean sprouts (1⁄3 cup/17 g per serving)
Roasted sesame seeds, for garnish
1 Preheat the oven to 325ºF (170ºC) with the rack set in the middle position. Combine the olive oil, 
rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper in a shallow baking pan. Add the tomatoes and toss until well coated, laying them cut side down before cooking.
2 Roast the tomatoes for 2 hours or until they are completely wilted and soft.
3 While the tomatoes are roasting, boil a pot of water for your noodles. Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as they’re done, drain well and refrigerate in a bath of cold water for at least 1 hour.
4 Cook the spinach in three batches. Heat 1 teaspoon sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the spinach leaves and sauté, moving around frequently until just cooked, about a minute. Remove and set in a bowl. Repeat with additional batches. When the spinach cools, squeeze out any excess water.

(Text)Green Seaweed Fried Chicken Ramen
I recently discovered aonoriko , a powdered seaweed used to season 
soups and tempura and as a topping for okonomiyaki  (a Japanese 
savory pancake). It’s a fine powder and adds dark-green specks of 
flavor, turning an ordinary batter into something special. This recipe makes an aonoriko-battered chicken that I broil instead of deep-fry, so it’s not only healthy but it takes on a dumpling-like quality that blends well with ramen.level 3

Noodles (optional), 
and Marinated 
Half-Cooked Egg 
(optional)
To Make in

Tonkotsu Base (page 5) 
or your base of choice
Ramen Noodles  
(page 13)
Marinated Half-
Cooked Egg (page 26)4 tbsp cornstarch (I prefer katakuriko, or Japanese  
potato starch)
3⁄4 lb (340 g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into  
bite-sized pieces
Nonstick cooking spray
Batter
1 egg
1⁄2 cup (120 ml) cold water
1⁄2 cup (55 g) flour
1 tbsp aonoriko (Japanese powdered seaweed)
1 tsp salt
Additional Toppings
1 can baby corn (2–3 ears per serving)
1 bunch pea shoots (small pile per serving)6 tsp grated ginger (1 tsp per serving)1 lemon, sliced into 6 segments
1 Set the oven rack to 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) from the heating element and preheat the broiler.
2 Sprinkle the cornstarch over the chicken pieces.
3 In a separate bowl, whisk the egg, cold water, and flour together. Gently incorporate the aonoriko 
and salt into the batter without overmixing.
4 Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and coat with cooking spray so that chicken doesn’t stick.
5 Dip the chicken pieces into the batter and lay them on the cookie sheet so that they don’t touch.
6 Broil for about 6 minutes, flip, then broil for an additional 5 minutes or until they start to brown around the edges. Watch closely so they do not burn, as ovens vary. They should resemble the texture of a dumpling.

(Text)Cheese Ramen
My friend Bradley, who often travels to Tokyo for business, insisted 
that I try his favorite cheese ramen shop, Tsukomo. They use a local artisan cheese called Golden Gouda that they grate paper-thin with a big machine that sits on the bar; then they place a huge mound of the cheese on the ramen. The finely shredded cheese melts right into every bite. This is my rendition of that delicious creation, but you must try the original if you are in Tokyo (page 159). This recipe is all in the prep, so once you have your major components made ahead of time, you really can throw this together very quickly.level 3

Marinated Half-
Cooked Egg (page 26)
Roasted Garlic Butter  
(page 31)1 cup (100 g) Brussels sprouts, outer leaves 
trimmed
2 tbsp olive oil (I prefer smoked olive oil)
1⁄2  tsp kosher salt
1 cup (235 ml) chicken stock
1 cup (100 g) finely grated aged Gouda cheese 
(use a microplane to get it very fine)
Additional Toppings
4 cups (400 g) finely grated aged Gouda cheese

1 Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). Put the rack in the middle position and line a baking sheet 
with parchment.
2 Toss your Brussels sprouts leaves with olive oil and sprinkle with kosher salt. Arrange them in a single layer so that they do not touch and bake for about 10 minutes or until crispy and brown around the edges. Watch carefully to avoid burning. Remove and set aside.
3 Boil a pot of water for your noodles.
4 Take your whole roasted bulb of garlic, if using, remove the cloves and smash them with the back of a knife to make a paste.

This recipe was inspired by photos of a matcha-infused ramen 
posted on my friend Brian’s Ramen Adventures  blog. I was inspired 
to make a tea-smoked duck ramen with a matcha-fortified Shio Base. My cousin Brian and his friend Jace helped me test this one 
out and both of them said they’d never had anything like it, and that it was as delicious as it was unique. The recipe requires a cedar plank that can be purchased online or at most cooking stores. Cedar planks impart an intense, smoky flavor to the duck in a relatively short amount of time. I add liquid smoke to make it even stronger.level 3

(Text)1 In a small bowl, whisk 2 teaspoons of the matcha powder with the shoyu, brown sugar, cinnamon, 
dry sherry, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, and liquid smoke to make a marinade. Soak the duck breasts  
in the marinade, cover, and chill overnight.
2 Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.
3 Remove the duck from the marinade and cut it on the skin side with a sharp knife in a crosshatch pattern. Season both sides with salt and pepper. Save the marinade for later use.
4 Place the cedar plank on the grill on direct heat and cover until it starts to smoke. Turn the plank over and place on indirect heat.
5 Place the duck, skin side up, on the plank and cook for about 25 minutes, or until an internal thermometer pushed into the duck reads 165ºF (74ºC).
6 Remove the duck from the plank and set skin side down on direct heat to crisp the skin, or approximately 3–4 minutes. Remove and let rest.
7 Boil a pot of water for your noodles. In a separate large pot, start preparing the broth for your Shio Base. To your 8 cups (1.8 L) chicken stock, add the butter, mirin, wakame, and shiitake mushrooms and bring this to a boil. Then lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes; strain out all solids.
8 To this stock, add 11⁄2 cups (360 ml) of Shio Base. Then add the remaining marinade from your duck 
and 4 teaspoons matcha, leaving the soup a deep green color. Heat this back up to a boil, lower the heat and let simmer until ready to use. Right before serving, crank it back up to a boil.
9 Slice your duck on the bias and set aside.
10 Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as they’re done, drain well and separate into serving bowls.
11 Pour 2 cups (475 ml) soup over each bowl of noodles. Top each bowl with 1⁄2 sliced duck per serving, 
sliced pear, some cilantro, and a marinated half-cooked egg.

Although my husband and kids were great testers for my recipes, 
I figured I’d give them a break from ramen every night and invite friends over during the day to taste some of the really special ones. This one hit it out of the park—the lobster shell infused Shio Base is what did it for them. It was also very pleasing to the eye—with the shredded purple cabbage adding such beautiful color and the lemon zest giving a brightness to both the soup and the lobster. This is one of my favorites.level 3

(Text)1 Preheat oven to 450ºF (230ºC).
2 Split the lobster tails down the center of the back by turning over and cutting in half lengthwise 
through the shell with kitchen scissors, starting from the top and leaving the fin intact.
3 Thread a soaked skewer through the underside of the tail through the bottom of the shell.
4 Brush the underside portion with the exposed meat with clarified butter. Wrap in foil and set on  a baking tray. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the lobster tails from the foil and reserve the drippings.
5 Make the Lobster Broth: In a large soup pot over a high heat, combine the stock, butter, mirin, kombu, dried shiitake mushrooms, bay leaves, and reserved lobster drippings. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer.
6 Carefully remove the lobster meat from the shell by sliding a knife under the meat and gently lifting it out of its shell. Add the shells and the lobster juices to your stock. Cover and simmer for about 30 minutes.
7 Boil a pot of water for your noodles.
8 Line a colander with cheesecloth and set it over a pot large enough to hold the stock. Strain the lobster stock and return it to the stove. Add 
3⁄4 cup (180 ml) Shio Base. Right before serving, crank 
it back up to a boil.
9 Boil the noodles—if fresh, boil for about 1 minute; if packaged, boil for about 2 minutes. As soon as they’re done, drain well and separate into serving bowls.
10 Pour 2 cups (475 ml) soup over each bowl of noodles. Top each bowl with a lobster tail, shredded purple cabbage, and a small mound of arugula and spinach mixed together. Add the lemon zest and a dollop of roasted garlic butter, and squeeze a lemon wedge over each bowl before serving.

(Text)Agedashi-Doufu Fried Tofu
When I ordered this in a restaurant, I couldn’t understand how the 
tofu could stay crispy when it’s swimming in sauce. I found out the trick here is to just lightly dust the tofu before frying it to achieve a delicate crispiness and still maintain a smooth and silky center. Too much batter makes it gummy. A daikon grater is essential here; try one and you’ll see what a difference it makes.level 2
Serves 4–6
Prep time: 20 minutes
2 blocks soft tofu
Vegetable oil, for frying3 tbsp cornstarch (I prefer katakuriko, or Japanese 
potato starch)
Sauce
1 packet dashi granules (keep in packet form)2 cups (475 ml) water3 tbsp shoyu (soy sauce)2 tsp mirin (sweet rice wine)2 tbsp sake
Garnish
1 daikon, peeled and grated with excess liquid 
squeezed out
4–5 chives, chopped (I prefer garlic chives)Bonito fish flakes, optional (1 tsp per serving)
1 Drain the tofu and wrap it carefully in a paper towel. Set it on a plate in the refrigerator for  
20 minutes to get all of the moisture out. Remove, unwrap, and cut the tofu into small cubes, each 
piece being 1 inch (2.5 cm) in width.
2 In a small saucepan, combine the dashi, water, shoyu, mirin, and sake. Heat to boil, then turn down to a simmer and cover. Simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the dashi packet and keep covered on a low simmer until ready to use.
3 In a deep frying pan, add enough oil so that the tofu can completely submerge (about 11⁄2 inches/  
4 cm). Heat on high to approximately 375ºF (190ºC), or when a small piece of the tofu sizzles immediately when added.
4 While the oil is heating, lightly dust the cornstarch onto the tofu so that it is completely covered on all sides. You can use a sieve to dust or make a little duster out of cheesecloth tied with baking string.

(Text)5 With a slotted spoon, gently lay the pieces of tofu into the hot oil, being careful not to overcrowd 
them. Cook in batches while rolling each piece over to cook on all sides. Remove when the tofu barely changes color and becomes crisp and almost inflated-looking. Do not brown. Set to drain on a paper towel.
6 Arrange a couple of spoonfuls of the sauce in a serving dish and lay a couple of pieces of your tofu in the sauce. Garnish with daikon, chives, and bonito fish flakes, if you like.

(Text)Basic Japanese Rice
Making fluffy and tender Japanese rice is a breeze if you have a  
rice cooker. I highly recommend treating yourself to one. Even the 
basic versions can keep your rice warm for days. How cool is that?  If you don’t have a rice cooker, no worries—making rice on the stove is pretty easy, too.
Japanese rice is shorter grained and higher in starch content than 
other rices, which gives it its stickier consistency. The rice needs to be washed multiple times to rinse off the surface starch and hydrate the grains. I actually prefer short-grain brown rice, which is cooked in the same manner. If you live near one, visit a Japanese market and you’ll see different brands of Japanese rice that vary according to region, price, and quality—be adventurous and try them out. When you’ve had an excellent bowl of rice, you’ll know.level 1
Makes as much  
as you need
Prep time:  
25 minutes
2 cups (400 g) Japanese short-grain white rice*
1 qt or 4 cups (1 L) water
* If you want to increase the amount of rice, add 2 cups 
(475 ml) additional water for every 1 cup (200 g) rice.
If you don’t have a rice cooker, follow these easy instructions for the stove top.
1 In a medium saucepan, add the raw rice and thoroughly rinse in the sink by pouring water over  
the rice until it is covered by about 2 inches (5 cm) of water. Swirl and squeeze the rice and water 
with your hands until the water looks milky.
2 Carefully pour out the milky water, leaving the rice. Repeat 3 times or until the water runs clear.
3 Once the water runs clear, give it a final drain. Cover the rice with 1 quart or 4 cups (1 L) water to begin cooking.
4 Place the lid on the pan and start cooking the rice on high until the water has come to a boil. Turn the heat down to just above a simmer and cook for 20 minutes (brown rice may require more cooking time). Do not remove the lid when cooking as steam will be released, extending the cooking time. Remove from heat and let steam with the lid on for an additional 10 minutes before serving. Results should be perfect!

(Text)139 SidesCya-han Fried Rice
In Japan, you’ll often see fried rice offered on the menu at ramen 
shops alongside fried dumplings. In my home growing up, we ate fried rice for breakfast. My own recipe has changed over the years but this is a basic one that you can add almost anything to. The options are endless, so experiment to make your own rendition: make it pork-free; throw in some chopped pineapple for a Hawaiian version; or use up those vegetables you didn’t finish last night.  
If you are making it for your kiddos, skip the sriracha.level 1

Basic Japanese Rice
To Make in 
Advance
Basic Japanese Rice 
(page 138)4 strips bacon
1⁄4 red onion, finely chopped
1 tbsp sesame oil
4 cups (745 g) cooked Basic Japanese Rice2 eggs2 tbsp shoyu (soy sauce)1 tsp sriracha (optional)
1 In a medium- to large-sized skillet, cook 4 strips of bacon until well done. Set aside on a paper 
towel and crumble when cooled. Do not discard your bacon grease.
2 In the pan with leftover bacon grease, sauté the onions on medium-high heat until they start to brown, stirring frequently for 2 minutes.
3 Add the sesame oil to the onions.
4 Immediately add the rice and incorporate until it is coated with the grease, oil, and onions. The rice will start to make a popping sound as it gets crispy.
5 Make a well in the middle of the rice and crack the eggs into it. Take a fork or chopsticks and mix the eggs up in the middle.
6 Combine the egg and rice mixture until the eggs cook through—you’ll be able to see little pieces  of cooked egg throughout as it completely cooks.
7 Add the shoyu and Sriracha, if using, and mix through.
8 Mix in the crumbled bacon right before serving to preserve its crispiness and serve warm.

(Text)Sweet Pork Gohan (Rice)
This recipe was inspired by one from my blogger friend Brian, at 
Ramen Adventures. He had just returned from Hiroshima where they were in the midst of a soupless tantanmen (Japanese version of a spicy Chinese-style ramen) boom. When you finish the noodles, there is a sludge of tare (highly packed flavoring base), ground pork, and green onions left in the bowl, to which you are meant to add rice. This is a very simplified, non-spicy variation but feel free to add a spicier kick if you’d like.level 1

(Text)141 SidesCucumber Sunomono (Salad)
This light and refreshing salad is the perfect accompaniment to a 
rich and filling bowl of ramen. The trick to making the cucumbers soak up all of the delicious dressing is to cut them wafer-thin. An inexpensive, plastic, Japanese mandoline slicer is the tool for the job and well worth the minimal investment.level 3
Serves 4–6
Prep time: 20 minutes, 
plus 1 hour to chill
2 cucumbers (I prefer Japanese or English 
cucumbers)
1⁄4 tsp salt, plus additional to season
1 tsp dried wakame (optional)
1⁄2 cup (100 g) sugar
1⁄2 cup (120 ml) Japanese rice vinegar
1 tsp shoyu (soy sauce)
Additional Toppings
Freshly cracked crab (optional)
Cooked baby shrimp (optional)Chopped octopus (optional)
1 Slice the cucumber with a mandoline on the lowest setting for a very thin cut. Put in a bowl 
and sprinkle with salt, incorporate, and set aside. This will help get all of the water out of the cucumber so that the salad is not soggy.
2 Soak the wakame in water for about 10 minutes. Squeeze out all excess water and julienne into thin strips. Whisk together the sugar, vinegar, 
1⁄4 teaspoon salt, and shoyu. Add the wakame.
3 Place the salted cucumbers in a colander and rinse with cold water. Squeeze out the excess water from the cucumbers and add to the vinegar mixture.
4 Chill for at least 1 hour before serving. If desired, top with freshly cracked crab, cooked baby shrimp, or chopped octopus.

(Text)Auntie Mary Jane’s Cauliflower  
no Tsukemono (Pickled Vegetables)
My Auntie Mary Jane is a great cook and her pickled vegetables 
make an ideal side dish for ramen—the tartness of the vinegar brine complements a rich ramen soup.level 1 
Serves 10
Prep time: 30 minutes
1 head cauliflower, broken into bite-sized pieces
1 small onion, sliced (I prefer Vidalia)1 carrot, sliced3–4 ribs of celery, sliced1 tsp red pepper flakes
Brine
1 cup (235 ml) white vinegar1 cup (200 g) sugar3 cups (700 g) water4 tbsp kosher salt
1 Prepare an ice bath. Cut your vegetables and blanch your cauliflower, onion, and carrot in a pot 
of boiling water in separate batches for 30 seconds each. Return the water to a boil for each batch. Remove the vegetables and plunge into an ice bath. Set the celery aside.
2 Heat brine ingredients—the vinegar, sugar, water, and salt—in a medium pot on a high heat. Bring to a boil for 3 minutes or until the sugar dissolves, stirring frequently. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature.
3 Put all of your vegetables in a container or glassware that can be covered. Pour the cooled brine mixture over the vegetables and refrigerate for at least 8 hours until ready to serve. Will keep for one week in a refrigerated airtight container.

(Text)143 Sides1 Boil a large pot of water for your potatoes, and add about 1 teaspoon of salt to the water. Add your 
potatoes and boil for about 25 minutes, or until a knife can cut through them easily.
2 While the potatoes are boiling, place your eggs into a separate pot of cold water, fully covering them. Bring to a boil, and then immediately remove from the heat and cover. Let the eggs sit in the hot water for 10 minutes. Place in an ice bath for 3 minutes, crack, and peel. Cut the eggs into bite-sized pieces, yolk included. Add to a large bowl, big enough to mix all of your ingredients without being crowded.
3 Add the pancetta, red onion, cucumber, gherkins, and carrot to the bowl.
4 Drain the potatoes and set aside to cool. When cool, cut them into bite-sized pieces. Add to the bowl with the apples and the Parmesan.
5 Add the mayonnaise, relish, mustard, salt, and pepper, and mix all ingredients until well incorporated.
6 Refrigerate and serve cold. Will keep for 3 days.Kim Family Potato Salad
My wonderful Korean friend, Soo, gave me this recipe. You’ll find potato salad in bento boxes all over Japan. I enjoy it as a chilled side dish to complement a bowl of cold ramen in the summer. This one has a sweet crunch from the apples balanced with a bright zest from the gherkins and relish. For this recipe, the order that you add your ingredients is important. The apples are added at the end so they don’t brown and the Parmesan is added after the potatoes so that the cheese can melt into the mixture. Thank you, Kim family, for sharing your secrets.level 1

(Text)Gyuniku Korokke (Beef and Potato Croquette) 
with Katsu Sauce
I never refuse the offer of a korokke . It is one of my favorite 
Japanese comfort foods. I love the super-crisp coating and their 
smooth, fluffy potato filling. The katsu sauce that you dip it in provides the zing that brings it all together.level 2

Prep time: 1 hour
1 tsp salt, plus additional to season
4 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered2 tbsp olive oil
1⁄2 onion, diced
1⁄2 lb (225 g) ground beef
1⁄4 cup (60 g) heavy whipping cream

(Text)4 Add the beef and onion mixture to the potatoes, and then pour over the whipping cream, sugar, shoyu, 
and a liberal sprinkling of salt and pepper. Combine well until mixture is ready to make small patties.
5 Prepare the Katsu sauce by combining the ketchup, shoyu, and Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl. Whisk together until incorporated.
6 Prepare a dipping station with the eggs beaten with a little water, flour, and breadcrumbs. Dip each croquette in egg, then flour, then egg again, then the breadcrumbs. Repeat for each croquette. You can freeze any croquettes you are not using in a freezer-safe container for up to 1 month.
7 Heat the oil on medium-high in the same sauté pan used before; use about 1⁄2-inch (6 mm) deep or 
half the width of a croquette. The oil will be ready when a pinch of breadcrumbs fries up quickly. Don’t overcrowd the pan, fry 3–4 croquettes at a time.
8 Remove the croquettes and set onto a wire rack, do not let them touch.
9 Serve warm and drizzle some Katsu sauce over the top.

(Text)Auntie Betty’s Shrimp Gyoza
My Auntie Betty is a legendary cook in our family. She gets a 
special Dace fish paste from May Wah supermarket in the Richmond District of San Francisco. If you’re ever in the area, grab some to make your gyoza just like hers. My auntie’s inspiration came from a little restaurant in San Francisco that used to make the most delicious gyoza. The owner gave her the recipe without any real measurements, but through trial and error, she perfected it. Enjoy!level 2 
Makes 30
Prep time: 1 hour
30 raw shrimp, peeled, deveined, and cleaned
1⁄2 cup (125 g) fish paste (I prefer Dace fish paste)
1⁄4 cup (62.5 g) dried dill
1 large garlic clove, minced
1 tbsp unsalted butter, melted2 tbsp heavy cream1 tsp white pepper1 package round won ton wrappers4 tbsp vegetable oil
1⁄8 cup (30 ml) chicken stock
Dipping Sauce
1⁄2 cup (120 ml) shoyu (soy sauce)
1⁄4 cup (60 ml) white vinegar
5 drops chili oil
1 Cut each shrimp into 3–4 small 1⁄2-inch (6 mm) pieces.
2 Combine the shrimp, fish paste, dill, garlic, butter, cream, and pepper in a medium bowl.
3 Drop the shrimp mixture by spoonful onto won ton rounds. Fold over and use hot water with your 
finger around half the round and fold over to seal.
4 Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and lay the wontons in a row—it’s fine if they are touching each other. If you want to serve them at a later date, freeze on an unlined baking sheet overnight, then transfer to a sealed bag to store.
5 Prepare the sauce by whisking the shoyu, vinegar, and chili oil until combined.
6 Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the gyoza on both sides. Do not crowd the pan. Pour the chicken stock in the pan, cover, and let simmer for 4 minutes. Remove and serve with the sauce.

I don’t normally serve fried food to my kids and I really tried to make 
this recipe by baking or broiling, but I just couldn’t get the same crispiness for my mom’s wings without resorting to a big ’ole pan of oil. We make these once a year for New Year’s, so it’s a special treat for all of us, but they are also great as a side dish with ramen. Warning: they are extremely addictive!level 2 
Makes 40 wings
Prep time: 1 hour
2 cups (475 ml) vegetable oil or enough to fill a medium-
sized, deep saucepan about 11⁄2 inches (4 cm)
1 cup (110 g) flour
1 cup (235 ml) water3 ice cubes2
1⁄2 lbs (1.1 kg) chicken wings, washed and towel-dried
Sauce
1 cup (200 g) sugar1 cup (235 ml) shoyu (soy sauce)2 tsp grated ginger
1⁄4 cup (60 ml) mirin (sweet rice wine)
1 Heat the sauce ingredients in a small saucepan to a boil and then turn down to simmer and  
leave it.
2 Prepare a wire rack on an aluminum foil-lined cookie sheet ready for the cooked chicken.
3 Heat the oil to medium-high in a deep saucepan.
4 Combine the flour and water to make batter. Add the ice cubes to the batter to keep cold, 
continuing to mix as the ice melts.
5 Test the oil by adding a very small amount of batter to the hot oil to see if it fries up quickly. If it does, your oil is ready.
6 Add the chicken wings to the batter in batches so that none are touching.
7 Fry in batches until both sides are brown and crispy; turn with metal tongs halfway through.
8 Dip the fried chicken wings in the simmering sauce for about 5 seconds.
9 Remove and drain on the prepared wire rack, making sure that the wings do not touch each other. This will maintain their crispiness. Serve hot or at room temperature.

Dynamite
Chirashizushi , or scattered sushi, is traditionally made by scattering 
raw fish and vegetables over sushi rice. This variation made by my 
cousin Jill mixes the ingredients into the rice and is topped with a crab dynamite mixture similar to those found on top of sushi that bakes up golden brown and is simply delicious. It’s filling, so it’s best to serve alongside a lighter-style ramen base such as Shio or Shoyu. It’s great for parties, too, as it can be served hot or cold. Thanks, Jilly-Bean!level 3

(Text)1 Preheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC) with the rack in the middle position.
2 In a large pot or a rice cooker, rinse and drain the rice to remove impurities. Do this three or four 
times or until the water runs clear. Add the kombu and cover with the 31⁄4 cups (770 ml) fresh 
water. Let soak for 30 minutes. If you have a rice cooker, transfer the rice to it and follow the instructions. If you don’t, cook your pot on high heat with the lid on. After the water has been boiling for 30 seconds, turn the heat down to simmer and continue to cook for 14–15 minutes. Briefly turn up the heat again, then remove from heat. Without removing the lid, allow the rice to steam for about 10 minutes.
3 In a small saucepan, whisk the rice wine vinegar, 1⁄3 cup (65 g) sugar, and salt. Bring to a boil, 
stirring often until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat.
4 In a small bowl, whisk the eggs. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium-  
high heat. Add the eggs in two separate batches and make two flat, thin omelets. Cool, roll up, and julienne.
5 Heat the shoyu and 1 tablespoon of sugar in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the lotus root and carrots and sauté until there is no more liquid in the pan, approximately 5 minutes.  
Set aside.
6 When the rice is done, quickly empty it into a large bowl and remove the kombu. Add the vinegar mixture, folding it in until the rice cools.
7 Add the julienned eggs from step 4 and the sautéed vegetables from step 5 into the rice and mix. Press into a 9 ×  13-inch (23 ×  33 cm) baking dish.
8 Sprinkle furikake on top.
9 Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes.
10 In a medium bowl, combine the mushrooms, onion, crab, mayonnaise, and sour cream. Layer on top of the rice.

(Text)Rameducate Yourself
It wasn’t very long ago that as far as most Americans were concerned, ramen was a block 
of dried noodles that was sold in a plastic package with a tiny envelope of mysterious seasonings, and wasn’t found much outside of college dorm rooms and the ateliers of starving artists. This “instant ramen” was developed by Momofuku Ando, a Taiwanese-Japanese businessman as a way to deal with post–World War II food shortages. It’s only in the past decade that most Americans, including myself, have learned about the more traditional-style ramen made with long-simmered broths and artisan noodles that even appear on the menus of four-star restaurants. 
My own ramen education took me from watching Tampopo , the classic movie about 
the Japanese love of food and search for the perfect noodle, directed by filmmaker Juzo Itami, to a more hands on one in Japan. While there, I enrolled in an intensive ramen-cooking course and toured the ramen shops of Tokyo with one of the city’s best-known ramen bloggers (see page 156). Not only did I immerse myself in the culture of ramen, but  I also learned a lot about myself as a Japanese-American.
The build-up to the trip included both excitement and trepidation. I am a yonsei , or 
fourth-generation Japanese-American, and this was my first visit to my home country.  
I don’t speak Japanese and I was worried about how people would treat me. I was told by relatives here in the United States to just speak English because the Japanese would rather not have you botch up their language; but if I was hakujin , or Caucasian, trying to speak 
Japanese then that would seem endearing. Weird. So, that’s how I started, by speaking English and being a good gaijin , or foreigner. Then my ten years of Japanese school started 
kicking in, and every so often, I would try to say something in the native language. To my surprise, my garbled version of Japanese, or “Janglish,” was met with overwhelming hospitality and patience. Being a yonsei seemed to inspire the locals to take me under their wings, knowing that I was Japanese—however long ago my ancestors lived there.  
It turned out to be an asset. 
I was eager to get home and incorporate my newfound wisdom into my recipes. Sensei 
Rikisai at the Miyajima Ramen School in Osaka taught me that ramen was introduced to Japan at the end of the Edo Era in the late nineteenth century when the country finally allowed visitors. Before that, the country had been formally closed to all foreigners. The Chinese came and introduced the noodle, lamien . The Japanese quickly changed the 
name to ramen  and sold it as street food. Around this same time, the Portuguese brought 
over a wind instrument called a shawm . The Japanese adapted it into what they call

(Text)153 Rameducate Yourselfa charumera , which was used by the ramen sellers to signal buyers to their carts, in 
the way that an ice cream truck plays a tune when it drives down the block. Ramen’s 
popularity began. 
I was lucky to have Brian MacDuckston, an American living in Tokyo who blogs about 
his favorite food at Ramen Adventures , as my guide to the ramen-yas  of Tokyo. He’s just 
completed a ramen guide for exploring fifty of the best ramen shops in Tokyo and anyone traveling there with a hankering for ramen should consider this guide a must-have. I asked him for a brief summary of the current state of ramen in Tokyo. Here’s what he had to say:
When the dish that would come to be known as ramen made its way from  
China to Japan, it was quite simple: noodles with a firm bite and a light broth, really meant only to keep the noodles hot and add a bit of flavor. It was easy to prepare in large quantities, quick to cook the noodles, and was well suited to feeding many people in a short amount of time. Burgers and fried chicken may be commonplace in modern Japan, but in the past one hundred years, ramen was the ultimate fast food.
It wasn’t long before moms were cooking ramen at home. With the advent  
of modern preservatives, the home-cooked ramen family meal could be as easy as a big pot of instant noodles, or as complex as handmade everything—soup from scratch topped with the family’s secret-recipe chashu . Most home meals lay 
somewhere in the middle—fresh noodles from the local noodle shop, a light chicken stock kicked up with umami-rich ingredients, and some roasted meats sourced from a nearby butcher. This was dinner for many modern Japanese families, and  the effect of the past few decades are being felt around the world today.
For many who grew up in Japan, ramen is deeply nostalgic. Slurping is 
probably the most fun way to consume food, and ramen doesn’t just encourage slurping, it practically requires it. So with the current generation of adults longing for their favorite childhood food, ramen shops have had to take things further. Known in Japanese as kodawari , chefs are paying extreme consideration 
to details. They’ll use soy sauce blends made from tiny craft breweries, salt flown in from around the world, and chickens that are fed peculiar diets of wild sesame and mushrooms to give their egg yolks more flavor. This trend of kodawari means some amazing yet still relatively basic bowls of ramen.
If slurping alone isn’t nostalgic enough, local varieties of ramen do even 
more to instill a sense of hometown. Some, such as Hokkaido’s famous miso ramen, use locally sourced ingredients, such as miso, corn, and rich butter, to recall the flavors of the far north. Other areas, such as Hakata with their thick pork tonkotsu ramen, are more about the style. Hakata is home to hundreds of late night yatai , or street stalls, that sell stinky, porky, delicious ramen well 
into the night. Other styles, such as Kitakata ramen, seem to mirror the simple

(Text)countryside life. Kitakata ramen is light enough to eat for breakfast, an activity 
enjoyed by many before heading off to work in the rice fields.
With the kodawari boom, many home cooks have been able to experiment 
with customizing their bowls. The Internet means that specialty ingredients are just a click away. It is these extras—high quality kodawari ingredients and local flair—that have elevated ramen from a simple noodle soup to the gourmet level that it stands at today.
As you explore the world of ramen, you’ll see how this regionality plays in the different 
soup bases and styles. Sensei Rikisai taught me that ramen is made up of three building blocks: a stock that is the base for everything; a small amount of tare , or a highly packed 
flavoring base, that is added to the stock to determine what type of ramen it is; and a fat that makes everything milder and balances the flavors out. Tare, when used as an adjective, becomes dare , as in shiodare , or strong salt flavor component. He described it 
as a perfectly staged play with each component having its own necessary role. With the exception of my Tonkotsu recipe (see page 5), which Sensei Rikisai taught me to make traditionally, I’ve simplified my other recipes and combined some of these building blocks to make it easier for the home cook.
The four main types of ramen that can be intermixed and changed by the stock, the 
tare, and type of fat added are Miso (miso paste blended in), Shio (a light salt component),

(Text)155 Rameducate YourselfShoyu (mainly soy-sauce based), and Tonkotsu (creamy pork soup). The only thing that’s 
a bit confusing is that Tonkotsu is a soup on its own, so you might see a Spicy Misodare Tonkotsu Soup, which is a combination of a Spicy Miso as the strong flavor component  
and Tonkotsu Soup. And a good soup has to have umami. My cooking course taught me that there are three kinds of umami: glutamic acid umami, which comes from ingredients such as seaweed and chicken; isocyanic acid umami, which comes from ingredients such  as dried fish and mackerel; and guanylic acid umami, which comes from ingredients  
such as shiitake mushrooms and pork. Believe it or not, umami is very scientific—it’s not just the fifth flavor sense that no one can describe. 
Aside from the umami factor, the texture of the noodles is vital to a good bowl of ramen. 
Noodles can be made with varying levels of gluten. To understand this, for instance, a baguette has a medium-high level of gluten, whereas tempura, sweets, and cookies are low in gluten. Ramen noodles are in the semi-high gluten category. Most ramen chefs mix up the types of flours they use in their ramen noodles to experiment with these gluten levels. I use a combination of bread flour, cake flour, and wheat flour because I think it makes a lighter noodle. You can also vary the percentage of water mixed with “baked baking soda” or kansui  
powder (see page 14) to make a noodle that has a certain density. Noodles can be skinny, fat, flat, etc.—there isn’t really a perfect formula. I use a 25 percent water to flour ratio in my recipe, but that’s just what I think gives the best results for the mix of flours I am using. 
Ramen is special because it’s not just noodles and soup. It’s a well-choreographed 
bowl of goodness, with each element able to stand out on its own. The time it takes to eat a bowl of ramen versus the time it takes to prepare it is completely disproportionate, another reason that makes this dish so intriguing. On your ramen path, you may want to seek out top-notch quality ramen by artisanal ramen masters who cultivate their own style. They’ll have secret variations in the way they incorporate these components, and you’ll start to recognize the differences the more you learn. What makes a good bowl for you may be a thick, rich Tonkotsu, or you might prefer a lighter Shio. That’s why ramen can please the most finicky of noodle freaks. 
What are the characteristics of a good bowl ? The perfect density of soup brimming 
with depth and layered flavor; salt content that’s not overpowering; handmade noodles that are firm yet springy, and hold up to the soup; and fresh toppings that have been given as much attention as everything else. A good bowl will give both your mind and body overall satisfaction and let you feel it for hours after as you lick your lips and still taste the soup lingering. Hungry yet?

(Text)156Want to try the real deal in Tokyo, Japan? Brian MacDuckston, my 
colleague from Ramen Adventures , chaperoned me along with my friends 
Margret and Andi to these six ramen-yas, which I highly recommend for a nice, well-rounded tour to experience the different types of ramen available in Tokyo.
Most Tokyo ramen-yas have very minimal seating, with seats at a 
bar and no waiting area. The chef is always present and is typically only accompanied by one or two apprentices, depending on the size of the shop. And it’s quiet. The Japanese like to face the chef and eat without talking or socializing. It is the same at sporting events or concerts in Japan; people stand side by side but there isn’t much interaction as they enjoy the show. It is their way of showing respect to the performer, and to the master and his expertise at a ramen-ya.
Customers respect the line and wait without complaining—no 
looking at their phones or talking too much. They place their orders and pay at a small ticket machine at the front of the shop, and then line up outside, and sometimes along the back wall of the restaurant, as their turn draws closer. When a seat opens up, they are prompted. They sit down quickly, hand over their tickets, and wait for their ramen. Within minutes, the bowl is presented on a raised bar in front of them. They dig into their ramen and finish within 15 minutes. With a polite “ gochisosama, ” they exit and the next person sits. This 
efficient system keeps the line moving quickly.
Some ramen-yas are set up in more of a restaurant-style with a 
waiter, a menu, and proper drink service. You are welcome to stay longer at these establishments but my advice is to show respect and do as others do. Eat, enjoy, and get out. You can talk later.Ramen Tour of Tokyo

This was our first ramen stop in Tokyo and probably the most formal of 
all of the ramen-yas we went to. It had a long line at 11 a.m.; it was the first time we used the ticket machine to place an order, and everyone was quiet as a mouse, except for the slurping, of course. We were advised by Brian to only take pictures of the ramen, but to do this very quickly. Our bowls were placed on the raised bar and it was as if we were paying homage by reaching for it with both hands and placing it in front of us to consume. My traveling partner and photographer for the trip, Andi, and I each shared the Shoyu and Shio varieties and thought they were divine. The soup wasn’t too heavy so we were able to finish them both, the egg filled with liquid gold and just enough negi (green onion) and chashu. The Shio version had a delicious green pesto-type topping that I think was made with anoriko , a powdered seaweed.

This was my first taste of tantanmen, a Japanese adaptation of a 
Szechuan-style spicy noodle dish known as Dan Dan noodles. I don’t tend to like super-spicy food, but the Premium Si Chuan–style bowl  was not too overpowering, and the sansho  pepper gave it an earthy, 
lemony taste that just slightly numbed my tongue. I loved that it was served mazemen -style (or without soup), so that the spices 
and the sauce were folded into every bite. I was just as fond of the owner, Master Okada-san. It’s also not a strict sit, eat, and get out establishment, which was refreshing!

I ordered the Shoyu-Niboshitare Tonkotsu ramen with a side of tender 
lamb. The Tonkotsu is cooked with pork and lamb bones with a lamb chashu and the most interesting prep of menma in long strips to top it off. My favorite part was Master Shono-san’s signature spice mix of ground cinnamon, cumin, and fennel seeds that was provided in a shaker at the table. The décor and ambience are cool and casual—he has a chandelier made out of niboshi , or dried infant sardines, in the 
front of the restaurant. He also has five other ramen shops in Tokyo, with one U.S. location in San Francisco.

I read about this place on ramenadventures.com before my trip and was 
so excited to taste their tsukemen , or dipping noodles, with Brian himself. 
Unfortunately, he had another appointment to go to and couldn’t stay for the whole experience, but he made sure we purchased the right ticket at the machine in the back and ushered us in. It was worth the wait—a complex and layered chicken-bone soup with deep fish flavors and an intensity that made every noodle-laden bite satisfying. Brian would later tell me that the soup is actually a tori paitan , with chicken bones 
cooked in the same way you would cook pork bones for a similar soup. It is then added to a second fish soup to give it that smoky flavor. Here the line continued to the back of the bar, where everyone watched over the customers in anticipation as seats would free up and our line slowly moved ahead. The master was super serious, very concentrated, and intently involved in his preparation for us. I was mesmerized.

type of local artisan cheese called Golden Gouda is incorporated into the soup and also piled high on top. It’s shaved to almost a powder form right at the bar, so it sinks and melts into the soup to give you a rich, thick, satisfying meal. You won’t be hungry for an hour or five later.

They serve tori paitan  here, which is ramen with a creamy chicken 
soup. There are only two menu items and they were out of one so we 
ordered the torishiroramen— their signature creamy chicken soup 
with a shiodare . There were delicate pieces of perfectly tender chicken 
and thin fried onions and shredded negi (Japanese green onion) on top with a crispy piece of garlic toast and some sweet minced garlic on the side. It was a graceful dish and very well-orchestrated. The restaurant is more upscale in a seated restaurant-style space. The line here took a little longer because of this but it was well worth the wait. They were voted best rookie tori paitan by Tokyo Ramen of the Year  
magazine in 2014, deservedly so.

(Text)One of the last emails I received from my husband, Dave, the week my cookbook was due read:  
“I would be lying if I said I won’t be happy when you submit everything!” Then he added, “Are we still 
having cheese ramen tonight?” and signed the note with a winking emoji. That pretty much sums up the last year of my life as my husband and three kids—Maggie, Ryan, and Ellie—indulged me, week-in and week-out, eating ramen until it came out of their ears, watching me cook like a madwoman, and helping me clean a huge kitchen mess EVERY DAY. They let me sneak downstairs and write recipes until two in the morning, while Dave took care of all the going-to-bed rituals. The two older kids, Maggie and Ryan, often walked to school the next day because I couldn’t function like I was supposed to in the morning for them.
My friends would say, “How do you do it all?” and the answer I would give them is, “I don’t. It’s nuts.” 
I gave up my marketing consulting business to devote myself to the cookbook full-time and be at  
home for the kids, but quickly found that melding the two just wasn’t possible without some suffering. I found that when I took time out for myself, which I desperately needed on occasion, my family would get the short end of the stick because I’d have to make up for working on recipes when I was with them, instead of really taking care of them. My eight-year-old daughter, Maggie, became my official noodle maker but she asked to be paid. I don’t think my seven-year-old son, Ryan, washed his face the entire year because I was too busy to notice. And when asked at my daughter’s preschool to describe what your mommy likes, my two-year-old, Ellie, said, “Sitting at the computer” and “Drinking juice (aka wine).” I gained ten pounds of ramen weight, but luckily, Dave told me he’s never been into petite women. I turned “lunch with girlfriends” into “come over and try some of my ramen.” So, we learn to make accommodations. I guess the answer to the question of how do I do it all is that I couldn’t have done it without my village of friends who pitched in when I needed help and a super-supportive and forgiving family who always told me that the last ramen I served them was the best one they’ve had yet. Love you, guys, so much.Acknowledgments
