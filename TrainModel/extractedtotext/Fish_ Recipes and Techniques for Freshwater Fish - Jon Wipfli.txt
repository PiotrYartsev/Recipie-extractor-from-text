Textintroduction
In this book, I cover multiple species of fish, ranging everywhere from bluegill to muskie, 
but could not reasonably cover every species of landlocked fish. For the purpose of func -
tionality I cover the species of which I have witnessed the most consumption. There is a 
plethora of species I would have liked to cover and, with any luck, those species will be 
covered in a future book. 
My goal in writing this book was to create recipes that can be made by chefs of any 
level while incorporating various techniques and ingredients that may be unfamiliar to 
some. Beyond that, I hope it creates an increased interest in obtaining your own protein 
and getting outdoors and fishing! I would love to hear from readers about what should be 
included in future editions! 
I hope this book is helpful to you. If you have questions about the book or need help 
navigating a recipe, please reach out to Jon.Wipfli@gmail.com or find me on Instagram  
@theminnesotaspoon and I’ll do my best to help.

TextTo research and write this book, I had to do quite a bit of fishing. This went far beyond 
solo trips. I was lucky enough to connect with some incredible fishermen and learn new 
fishing techniques along the way. We fished for steelhead and whitefish in Michigan, lake 
trout on Lake Superior, muskie and walleye in Wisconsin, and made it to the Dakotas for 
some ice fishing. It was eye-opening to see how different people specialize in one style of 
fishing—and the work, time, and money they put into it. 
To people who do this daily, it seems like simple work, but for an outsider looking 
in, it’s outstanding. The knowledge I took away from these fishermen on fish habitat, 
habits, and cycles was astounding. For example, I watched an expert fisherman navigate 
the endless waters of Lake Superior knowing exactly where specific lake-bottom terrains 
appeared and observed another knowing exactly which night the herring run would occur 
based on when the snow melts. This is knowledge gained slowly over years of persistence 
mixed with trial and error, all while typically not being able to see the subject until it 
breaks the plane of the water. There’s an underappreciated wealth of knowledge these 
individuals carry, and I have an immense respect for them. 
I grew up fishing the waters of northern Wisconsin, never taking it too seriously. As 
a kid and young adult, my friends, family, and I would often catch walleye, gill, crappie, 
bass, and northern pike and walleye pike near our family cabin. In my twenties I moved 
to Montana and found an immense amount of pleasure in learning to fly-fish its massive 
rivers and the beautiful lakes I found nestled high in the mountains. In my late twenties I 
caught the muskie bug after my close circle of hunting friends introduced me to the sport. 
Again, I was lucky enough to spend time in boats with folks more knowledgeable than I, 
chasing monster muskies and occasionally hook into one myself. 
The more time we spent in boats not catching muskies (so, about 98 percent of the 
time), the more I learned that success when fishing isn’t measured by fish caught, follows, 
or inches measured. It’s all about getting outside, drinking some beers with friends, and 
learning about what’s happening in the natural world that surrounds us. No matter your 
skill level, there’s an easy way to get out and sink a line into the water, and I can’t think of 
a better way to spend a day.

TextBIG PICTURE
Beyond the sporting aspect of it, lake and river fishing is generally a sustainable and af -
fordable way to obtain food. Fish management and stocking, for the most part, is well 
regulated and well done. Dollars spent for fishing licenses provide countless jobs and help 
protect our right to use these lands. Personally, it’s the best money I spend every year. 
If you enjoy the privilege of being able to use public lands as much as I do, continue to 
buy those licenses, bring your friends out on adventures, and find other ways to support 
public lands. 
All this said, this book is a cookbook, not a fishing book. I am not a fish biologist nor an 
expert fisherman. Fishing is an activity in which I’ve found meaning and pleasure over the 
course of my life, but I am in no way an expert resource on the subject. My specialty lies in 
cooking, and I find it very satisfying, on many levels, to expertly prepare food I’ve killed. 
As always, be mindful of what you take and how you take it. Always follow all applicable 
laws and regulations.  And, if possible, find out what condition the lake is in and if it has 
a healthy and robust fish population. 
NOTE 
It’s also good to keep in mind that eating any large predatory fish comes with some health risks, 
mostly stemming from mercury content and other containments in the waters. They should not be 
eaten in large quantities or fed to children, pregnant women, or the elderly. If you do decide to catch 
and keep one, please do due diligence on the fish, the fishing habitat, and any and all health risks 
associated with it.

TextEATING
Wild game cookbooks can be challenging to organize because more than one fish or piece 
of game can work for many recipes. Generally speaking, I think people with a freezer full 
of fish will look for some flavor combinations that interest them and go with whatever’s 
just been caught (or is in the freezer). For example, you can substitute perch for crappie in 
the Crappie Escabeche (page 107) without any real effect on the quality of the dish—and 
you can find examples like that across the entire book. Grouping recipes into substitut -
able categories of fish reflects that formatting. Fish that I believe can be easily substituted 
for another find their way into the same groups, so feel free to substitute within those 
categories with minimal risk to the end results. But even that is not a hard rule, as you can 
move different species around to various recipes throughout the book once you learn the 
different characteristics of the fish. 
I approached this book in a similar fashion to the way I approached my first book, 
Venison . I include a mix of more elevated dishes that require a bit of technique, as well 
as meals that can be easily cooked over a fire (and just as easily enjoyed). I try to strip my 
recipes of extra steps to keep the majority accessible to cooks of all skill levels. 
I also think of these recipes as a baseline for a final dish. Recipes and ingredients have 
countless variables, making it difficult to re-create a dish exactly as written under the best 
of circumstances. I recommend taking ownership of these recipes and playing with them 
to suit your tastes. Using the techniques and the base recipes will get you off to a great 
start. However, using your own tastes to alternate spices, vegetables, seasonings—even 
swapping out the fish for another type—will be a delicious exploration. 
With any luck, you’ll soon be sharing these recipes with the same family members and 
friends you were with when you caught that fish. Good luck on the lake and have fun in 
the kitchen!

Cooking over live fire imparts flavors to any meal that you can’t manufacture any other 
way. Live fire is one of my favorite ways to cook and is mentioned frequently in this book, 
so I want to review the basics of a good fire. 
Whether it’s a grill, an open pit, or any other grilling unit, here are some tips for open-
flame cooking—mostly based on using charcoal and wood. 
For a high-temperature grill , I like to use natural lump charcoal mixed with small chunks 
of hardwood, preferably oak. With this method it’s best to get the lump charcoal hot and 
add the chunks of wood to get them smoking. Once they’re black and smoldering, it is a 
good time to add the protein to the grill. 
 ĦWhen operating with straight hardwood only,  I like to get a good base of 
wood coals going from burning logs at a high temperature and then add a 
log or two on top to get a nice smoky flavor. It’s unrealistic to judge a certain 
surface temperature, but a grill anywhere in the 400°F to 650°F (200°C to 
343°C) range is suitable for most applications. 
 ĦWhen I write “start a fire,” this is what I’m referring to. 
 ĦDepending on the heat of the grill you may have to rotate and flip your fish 
less or more often. 
 ĦFor optimum results make sure your grill and grates are clean. 
 ĦTo prevent sticking, coat the grates with a light layer of grapeseed oil and make 
sure they’re hot before adding the fish. 
 ĦPractice cooking over open fires. It’s an imperfect art but has lots of benefits. 
Finding a rhythm over the fire will develop over time, and your success rates 
will be nearly perfect.

TextFish species vary widely in taste and texture. Fish can have a sweet, lighter flavor, such 
as walleye, or a heavier, oilier flavor as seen in salmon. Some have a lighter and flakier 
texture, such as bluegill, compared to the steak-like quality of sturgeon. Preferring one 
quality another is up to the consumer, but, with few exceptions, all these fish are better 
eaten when as fresh as possible. 
If you’re purchasing fish from a fishmonger, look for these signs to ensure you are get -
ting the freshest fish possible. 
 ĦThe eyes should be bright, not clouded.
 ĦThe flesh should bounce back when poked and it should not be mushy.
 ĦThe fish should smell fresh. All fish have a “fishy” smell, but it should be a 
clean fish scent. 
 ĦTrust your gut. If something seems amiss, it very easily could be. Don’t buy 
that fish.
Before cooking, or even butchering, fish, there are two crucial steps to finalize 
your catch:  proper cleaning and proper storage. These are both simple steps but take 
some diligence to do correctly. After you pull your catch out of the water, gut it as soon 
as possible and put the fish on ice. Keep the fish on ice up until the time you clean it and 
immediately put it back on ice until you cook or freeze it. While in culinary school, a pro -
fessor used to tell me if you start a recipe with crap, you’ll end up with crap. If the fish isn’t 
properly cleaned and stored, you’ll find yourself in that pickle.

TextCLEANING
Fresh fish are susceptible to quick muscle breakdown and turning into something you 
don’t want to eat. Gutting and cleaning fish quickly for preparation or the freezer is cru -
cial to getting the best possible product. Killing, gutting, cleaning, scaling, and cooling the 
fish rapidly yield the best results. I can be a bit over the top when I clean fish—removing 
the guts and scales before removing the fillets. The other way I approach it is skipping 
both of those steps (ignoring the gutting process) and just removing the fillets. When 
you’re not cooking a whole fish or cooking skin-on fish, it’s much quicker to skip scaling, 
but I do appreciate having scales off the skin while removing the meat from the skin. Take 
the process to your level of needs. 
Always use a sharp knife (I like to use either a flexible boning knife or hard Japanese 
steel) and have a large, clean cutting board available and a sink nearby.

TextSCALING
Scaling comes first if you’re planning to cook the fish immediately or freeze the fish with 
the scales off. When scaling fish, cleanup is easier if you have a fine drain catch in your 
sink. I find the process much simpler if the fish is cold, somewhere around refrigerator 
temperature (34°F, or 1°C). 
In my experience, I like to scale fish before freezing so that I know all the frozen fish 
are consistently prepped. If a label wears out or I can’t identify whether the fish is scaled 
through the packaging, I know what I’m getting before the fish is thawed. 
Scaling the fish for fresh cooking is also a great option. The skin of fish is one of the 
most flavorful parts of the animal; it helps keep in moisture while cooking and eliminates 
the risk of meat loss during the butchering process. 
To scale a fish effectively, you’ll need a couple things:
 ĦScaler:  A great scaler can easily be found online for less than $20. It will save 
you a boatload of time and last forever, so it’s money well spent. 
 ĦRunning water: Whether a stream or a faucet, water helps keep your 
workstation clean and ready to butcher. 
STEPS FOR SCALING FISH
1. If desired, remove all the fins of the fish with a pair of kitchen shears.
2. Under running water, run your fish scaler against the grain of the fish until all 
the scales are removed (A). 
3. It’s common to have some scales left near the fin areas of the fish and on the 
underbelly. Double-check those areas to make sure all scales are removed.

TextGUTTING
The first step to gutting a pile of fish is cracking a cold one. After that it’s pretty easy. Cut 
shallowly from the anus to the gills and pull out all the smelly stuff. If you do have a pile of 
fish, gut them all at once and then move on to butchery to help avoid cross contamination. 
Once all the guts are out, give the fish an extra rinse to make sure all the particulates are 
out as well. 
STEPS FOR GUTTING FISH
1. Place a sharp knife into the anus of the fish, just barely through the flesh (A). 
2. Cutting as close to the skin as possible, cut the fish up toward the beginning of 
the gills (B). 
3. With kitchen shears, snip anything connecting the guts to the fish from inside 
the throat cavity. Remove anything in the cavity by pulling it out with your 
hands (C) and rinse the inside of the fish thoroughly (D). A

TextOnce the fish is gutted, it’s time to either scale it, store it for future cooking, or cook it 
immediately. If you’re not scaling before freezing, skip to page 35 and then come back to 
scaling (see page 28).A clean cavity should look about like this.

TextSTORING
Proper storage is crucial for fish. It makes all the difference between enjoying your catch 
and ruining it before it ever hits the kitchen. Fortunately, there are multiple ways you can 
store fish to keep it tasting its best. 
When I store fresh fish in a restaurant, I place the fish on top of a stainless steel per -
forated pan inserted into a deeper stainless steel pan. I cover the fish tightly with plastic 
wrap and place a bag of ice on top of the fish in the refrigerator. While it may seem like a 
bit much, this technique is the best way to store fresh fish and give it the longest shelf life. 
If you don’t want to go through that process of fresh fish storage, I recommend storing 
fish in a container that gives it the ability to lose moisture but not sit in its own juices. Any 
sort of perforated pan placed over a container to catch drippings will do. 
If you’re planning to freeze the fish, best success is with vacuum sealing whole, gutted, 
scaled fish. Keeping the fish whole means less surface area is exposed, which helps retain 
moisture in the fish. Freezing fish in blocks of ice is a good technique as well, but I prefer 
the space and time efficiency of using a vacuum sealer. Freezing in tightly sealed reseal -
able bags is also a good solution, but freezer burn will creep up on you much quicker, so 
plan to eat it sooner rather than later.

TextFILLETING
Congratulations, you now have a fish that’s ready to butcher! This brings me to my friend 
Anderson, who volunteered his butchering skills in service of this book. Anderson works 
with fish of all varieties at a fish company called The Fish Guys located in Minneapolis, 
Minnesota. The sheer volume of fish he sees and works with makes him a great resource 
for all things that live in the water. When we came up short catching fish for this book, 
Anderson and The Fish Guys were right there with something to fill in the spot. 
There are two types of fish filleting for the fish used in this book. First is for your 
standard-issue walleye, bluegill, perch, and so on, and second is for northern and muskie. 
There are minor differences in all the fish, but the basics are the same. With northerns 
and muskies you have to look out for Y bones, which are fine bones that stand up through 
the midsection of the fish; the rest can be butchered without this in mind. For the pur -
poses of this book I refer to the cleaning of northern and muskie as a “five fillet” fish. The 
more traditional method, I’ll call the “two fillet” method. 
I’ve seen a few overarching techniques for filleting fish, but my favorite comes from 
Anderson, who can move through a pile of fish damn quickly. Starting with a gutted fish 
he simply cuts in front of the gills and then straight across the backbone, keeping the 
rib bones in place on the fillet. He then flips the fillet, removes the ribs, and fillets the 
fish cleanly. 
The following steps assume you are working with gutted fish. If you plan to keep the 
skin on for cooking, scale the fish before taking fillets off the body.

TextFILLETING “TWO FILLET” FISH
1. Place your sharp knife just in back of the gills of the fish (A).
2. Cut down toward the spine until your blade hits the spine. Cut through the 
spine and remove the head and set aside. 
3. Place your knife blade parallel to the spine at the opening where the head was 
(B).
4. Making sure your knife is running underneath the open gut side of the meat, 
run your knife along the spine of the fish all the way through the base of the 
tail and remove the fillet (C & D) .
5. Place your knife parallel on the other side of the spine and run your knife 
down the spine to remove it from the flesh (E & F) . 
6. With the flesh facing upward, carefully remove the ribs by running your knife 
under the rib cage (G & H) . 
 If keeping the skin on, skip steps 7 and 8.
7. Run your knife between the flesh and the skin at the tail end of the fish for 
about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Make a small incision with your knife into the skin of 
the fish by the tip of the tail, large enough to poke your finger into.
8. With your finger anchoring the skin of the fish, run your knife, angled toward 
the skin, down the rest of the fillet.
9. Remove pin bones toward the front of the fish by cutting around the line 
where you can feel them or remove them with bone tweezers.

TextFILLETING NORTHERNS AND MUSKIES   
(“FIVE FILLET” FISH)
1. Place your gutted and scaled fish on a cutting board, stomach side down.
2. Place a knife behind the head at the back of the gill plate and cut it down to 
right above the spine. Run the knife just across the top of the spine all the way 
down to the tail and remove the back fillet. Set aside.
3. Place the fish on its side. 
4. About three-fourths of the way down the fish toward the tail, run your knife 
down to the spine.
5. Turn your knife to align with the spine and remove the tail fillet. Repeat on the 
other side.
6. Place the fish back on its stomach. 
7. Look down into the meat and locate the Y bones.
8. Cut along the outside of the bones down toward the cutting board and remove 
the fillet around the ribs. Repeat on the other side.
9. If desired, remove the meat from the skin using the aforementioned  
filleting technique. 
10. Use all scraps for Basic Fish Stock (page 151).

TextWood-Fired 
Salmon
Salmon definitely is best when it’s as fresh as possible. This recipe doesn’t require many steps or 
ingredients, so any signs of deteriorating fish will be noticeable in the finished dish. The simple com -
bination of super fresh fish, lemon, salt, and smoke is perfect. I originally made this as an appetizer to 
pick at right off the hot griddle. Turn to Wood-Fired Salmon with Fennel Salad and Seasoned Yogurt 
(page 49) for a more complete recipe fit for plating. These steaks could also be used elsewhere, like 
in the Catfish Tacos with Crema and Tomatillo Salsa (page 119). Use any leftovers for a salmon quiche 
(see Steelhead Trout Quiche with Fiddleheads and Arugula, page 66) or pudgy pie (see Smoked 
Trout–Stuffed Pudgy Pie Hash Browns (page 62)! 
YIELD: Serves 4 to 6 
INGREDIENTS 
Grapeseed oil, for cooking
1 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley
1 lemon, sliced (save the ends 
for squeezing)
Four 8-ounce (225 g) 
salmon fillets
Kosher saltPROCEDURE
Start a fire in your grill with natural lump charcoal (see page 23). 
Once the coals are hot and roasting, add a log or two of your 
chosen wood (hickory or apple). Let the logs burn down until the 
flames subside. Y ou want a temperature around 450°F (230°C). 
Drizzle a large cast-iron skillet with grapeseed oil. Spread the 
parsley evenly over the pan. Place the lemon slices on top of the 
parsley. Top the lemon with the salmon fillets. Lightly coat the 
salmon with grapeseed oil and season with salt. 
Place the skillet on the grill grate and close the grill lid. Slightly 
crack the grill vents. Smoke should be able to escape, but the 
grill should also hold a bit of smoke. Cook for 6 to 7 minutes, 
depending on your grill’s temperature, or until the fish reaches an 
internal temperature of 145°F (63°C) measured with an instant-
read thermometer. 
Squeeze some lemon from the reserved ends over the top and 
pick away, or transfer to plates and serve.

TextFennel Salad 
with Wood-Fired Salmon  
and Seasoned Yogurt 
This recipe pairs the Wood-Fired Salmon (page 48) with a rich, herbaceous yogurt and crispy fennel 
salad. Fennel has a strong licorice flavor that pairs well with fish, and cutting it thinly on a mandolin 
makes the taste a little less overwhelming. The final product is light and crisp, leaving you refreshed! 
YIELD: Serves 4 to 6
INGREDIENTS FOR THE 
SEASONED YOGURT
1 cup (230 g) plain full-fat 
Greek yogurt
1 tablespoon (6 g) fennel seed
1 tablespoon (20 g) honey
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly cracked 
black pepper
INGREDIENTS FOR  
THE FENNEL SALAD  
AND SALMON 
1 garlic clove, thinly sliced
1 Thai chile, thinly sliced
1 small shallot, minced
2 tablespoons (30 ml) 
champagne vinegar or freshly 
squeezed lemon juice
2 fennel bulbs, quartered, 
cored, and sliced as thinly as 
possible (see tip)
Kosher salt 
6 tablespoons (90 ml) 
grapeseed oil
1/4 cup (16 g) fresh parsley, 
roughly chopped
1 recipe Wood-Fired 
Salmon (page 48)PROCEDURE
To make the seasoned yogurt:  In a small bowl, whisk all the 
ingredients for the seasoned yogurt. Cover and refrigerate 
until needed. 
To make the fennel salad and salmon: In a large bowl, stir 
together the garlic, Thai chile, shallot, and vinegar. Let sit for 
about 30 minutes. 
Add the sliced fennel to the vinegar mixture. Season to taste 
with salt and toss to combine. Let the mixture sit for 10 minutes 
to soften the fennel. Add the grapeseed oil and parsley and toss 
to combine. 
To plate, place a spoonful of yogurt on the plate, a salmon fillet on 
top, and finish with a bit of fennel salad.
COOKING TIP
A mandolin is a slicing device that will change your life in the 
kitchen! It will help you cut things extremely evenly and thinly in 
a fraction of the time it takes with a knife. Watch your fingertips, 
though, and use a thick glove to protect your slicing hand. Cut -
ting your finger on a mandolin is a mistake you’ll make only once.

TextSalt, Sugar, and 
Dill–Cured Salmon
Curing with salt, sugar, and dill is one of the most traditional methods for making cured salmon. It’s 
a tried-and-true technique you can’t go wrong with as long as you use fresh salmon . In the recipe 
following (page 52), I pair this salmon with crème fraîche and some traditional accents on toast—but 
I encourage you to use your imagination. It can make its way into omelets, top bagels or eggs Bene -
dict, or be plainly sliced onto a charcuterie platter. It’s an extremely versatile ingredient. Y ou can also 
use this same process with other fish, such as trout or bass.
YIELD: Serves 10 to 12 when 
used as part of other recipes
INGREDIENTS
1 cup (300 g) kosher salt
1 cup (200 g) sugar
Two 24-ounce (680 g) salmon 
fillets, bones removed 
as needed 
2 bunches fresh dill, 
roughly choppedPROCEDURE
In a small bowl, stir together the salt and sugar until blended. 
Sprinkle the bottom of an 8 x 12-inch (20 x 30 cm) glass baking 
dish with a layer of the salt and sugar mixture and a layer of dill. 
Lightly season the skin side of one salmon fillet with the salt and 
sugar mixture and place it, skin side down, in the baking dish. 
Aggressively season the flesh side of that fillet with the salt and 
sugar mixture and spread a handful of dill over the fish. 
Aggressively season the flesh side of the second fillet and place 
it on top of the fillet in the dish so that flesh is resting on flesh. 
Aggressively season the skin side of the exposed salmon and 
spread the remaining dill over the top.
Cover the salmon with plastic wrap and place some weights, such 
as bricks or a couple of large tomato cans resting on a sheet of 
parchment, on it, pressing the salmon down evenly. Refrigerate. 
Flip the fish every 12 hours and drain the juices collected each 
time it’s flipped. Do this four times over a curing period of 
48 hours. 
After 48 hours, wipe away any excess salt with a damp cloth 
and the salmon is ready to eat. When you’re ready to serve it, 
remove the skin.

TextCured Salmon 
with Crème Fraîche, Lemon,  
and Dill on Toast
This is a straightforward dish that seems to please everyone. The star is diced cured salmon with 
some added fat in the form of crème fraîche, fresh lemon for acidity, and dill for a pop of freshness. 
Shallots and capers add to the depth of flavor, but aren’t necessary for a great-tasting end result. If 
you don’t have time to cure the salmon yourself, buy cured salmon for this recipe.

TextDeviled Eggs 
with Smoked Salmon
I feel like everyone has experienced a few versions of deviled eggs. When done well, the filling 
should be bright, fresh, and creamy. The eggs should have good texture from being perfectly cooked 
(see tip), and the toppings should add the final send-off to deviled egg heaven. 
This is my standard deviled egg recipe, but topped with a bit of smoked salmon. If you have cured 
salmon, salmon roe, caviar, or pretty much anything else sitting around the house, it can be used as 
a substitute for the wood-fired salmon. Perfecting the filling is all about using homemade aioli. If you 
want the perfect eggs, take your time!
YIELD: Serves 4 to 6 as  
a snack
INGREDIENTS
12 large hard-boiled 
eggs, shelled
1/3 cup (75 g) Homemade 
Aioli (page 87), plus 
more as needed
2 tablespoons (30 g) stone-
ground mustard
2 teaspoons garam masala
1 teaspoon freshly squeezed 
lemon juice, plus more to taste
1 teaspoon Tabasco
6 ounces (170 g) Wood-Fired 
Salmon (page 48; leftovers 
work well) 
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Paprika, for garnishing
Fresh dill sprigs, for garnishingPROCEDURE
Halve the eggs lengthwise. Remove the yolks from the whites 
and set the whites aside. Press the yolks through a tamis or fine-
mesh strainer, or put them through a potato ricer, so they fall in 
fine particles. 
In a large bowl, stir together the aioli, mustard, garam masala, 
lemon juice, and Tabasco. Using a rubber spatula gently fold the 
egg yolks into the aioli. Taste and add more lemon juice, salt, 
and pepper, as needed. Y ou can also add more aioli if you want a 
creamier consistency. 
Transfer the egg and aioli mixture into a piping bag with a 
medium tip. Pipe the filling into the egg whites. Alternatively, 
spoon them into the egg cavities. Top with the salmon, a sprinkle 
of paprika, and a dill sprig. 
COOKING TIP
If you’re having trouble making well-cooked eggs, combine the 
eggs and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. 
Remove the pan from the heat and place a lid on the pan. Let the 
eggs sit for 7 minutes. Add ice to the water and let your eggs cool 
before peeling.

TextWild Rice–Stuffed 
Steelhead Trout 
with Asparagus Salad and Beurre Blanc
I first learned of this recipe while fishing for steelhead trout in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. The pair -
ing of two celebrated Midwest ingredients makes for a great flavor combination, and the wild rice 
adds a nice bite of texture. Beurre blanc (a French butter sauce) ties the whole thing together and 
adds the perfect amount of savory to the dish. Make sure the wild rice is fully cooked before stuffing 
the trout, as it won’t continue to cook in the fish. 
YIELD: Serves 6 to 8
INGREDIENTS FOR 
THE WILD RICE
2 tablespoons (28 g) 
unsalted butter
3 celery stalks, diced
1 medium carrot, diced
1 medium yellow onion, diced
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon (3 g) minced fresh 
thyme leaves
8 ounces (225 g) wild rice
1 quart (960 ml) chicken stock, 
plus more as needed
Kosher salt 
INGREDIENTS FOR THE 
ASPARAGUS SALAD 
8 large asparagus stalks 
1 teaspoon freshly squeezed 
lemon juice
1 tablespoon (15 ml) 
grapeseed oil
Kosher saltPROCEDURE
To make the wild rice:  In a 6- to 8-quart (5.8 to 7.6 L) pot over 
medium heat, melt the butter. Add the celery, carrot, onion, garlic, 
and thyme. Sweat the ingredients until soft, about 4 minutes. 
Add the wild rice. Toast for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring. Add the 
chicken stock and bring the mixture to a simmer. Simmer until 
the wild rice has popped and is fully cooked, about 50 minutes. 
Add more chicken stock as needed, if the rice gets dry. Taste and 
season with salt. Let cool at room temperature. 
While the rice cooks, make the asparagus salad:  Using a 
mandolin or vegetable peeler, thinly shave the asparagus 
lengthwise. In a medium bowl, combine the shaved asparagus, 
lemon juice, and grapeseed oil. Toss to coat. Taste and season 
with salt. Set aside.
To make the steelhead trout:  Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). 
Lightly coat a sheet pan with grapeseed oil and set aside. Open 
the cavity of the fish and fill it with as much of the cooked wild 
rice as possible. (Y ou’ll probably have some rice left over that you 
can warm and serve on the side.) Using butcher’s twine, tie the 
fish as closed as possible without squeezing out all the wild rice. 
Season the outside of the fish with salt and pepper. 
Place the fish on the prepared sheet pan. Bake for 45 to 50 
minutes, or until the fish reaches 145°F (63°C) measured with an 
instant-read thermometer and is cooked to your liking.

One 3- to 4-pound (1.35 to 1.8 
kg) steelhead trout, gutted 
and scaled
Kosher salt 
Freshly ground black pepper
INGREDIENTS FOR 
BEURRE BLANC 
1 medium shallot, finely diced
3 tablespoons (45 ml) white 
wine vinegar
1 tablespoon (9 g) peppercorns
1 tablespoon (5 g) 
coriander seeds
8 tablespoons (1 stick, or 112 g) 
cold unsalted butter, cubed
Splash heavy cream
Freshly squeezed lemon juice, 
for seasoning
Kosher salt If you enjoy eating the skin, turn on the broiler. Place the fish 
under the boiler for 1 to 2 minutes to crisp the skin a bit. Remove 
the fish from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
While the fish cooks, make the beurre blanc: In a 2-quart (960 
ml) saucepan over medium heat, combine the shallot, vinegar, 
peppercorns, and coriander. Bring to a simmer. Cook until the 
liquid reduces to the consistency of a glaze, about 6 minutes. 
Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a small 
heatproof bowl. Return the liquid to the pan and place it over 
very low heat. One at a time, add the butter cubes, whisking 
constantly until each melts into the liquid before adding the next. 
Work slowly so the butter doesn’t separate. Once all the butter 
is incorporated, whisk in the heavy cream. Season to taste with 
lemon juice and salt. 
To serve:  Cut the twine away from the fish. Pull off some of the 
meat and plate with a scoop of wild rice from the cavity. Ladle on 
the beurre blanc and garnish with a handful of asparagus salad.

TextLake Trout in Foil 
with Fennel, Mushrooms,  
and Sugar-Cured Jalapeños
Cooking over open flames and in aluminum foil is second nature to me. When I began studying 
French cuisine, the technique and ingredients were elevated and given a name that sounded new 
and exciting to me— en papillote , which means “in paper.” It’s the same idea here, but with foil instead. 
The benefit of cooking in paper or foil is all the moisture stays within the cooking vessel, produc -
ing an extra-succulent dish. There’s also something to the less-than-precise nature of the process 
that seems to make the food taste even better. Bonus: there are no dishes to worry about cleaning 
if you and your guests are good with eating straight from the foil! Arugula salad (see Sturgeon and 
Roast Beets with Yogurt, Grapefruit, and Arugula Salad, page 131) makes a great optional garnish.
The sugar-cured jalapeños take 24 hours to prepare, so you will need to plan ahead. If jalapeños 
are too hot for your palate, use bell peppers or a mix of peppers for a milder garnish. 
YIELD: Serves 6 to 8
INGREDIENTS FOR THE  
SUGAR-CURED JALAPEÑOS
8 jalapeño peppers, 
thinly sliced 
1 cup (200 g) sugar
INGREDIENTS FOR THE 
LAKE TROUT IN FOIL
1 pound (454 g) button 
mushrooms, cleaned 
and halved
1 fennel bulb, 
cleaned and diced
1 tablespoon (15 ml) melted 
unsalted butter
1 tablespoon (3 g) fresh 
thyme leaves
Kosher salt
1 lemon, sliced
One 3- to 4-pound (1.35 
to 1.8 kg) lake trout, 
filleted and bonedPROCEDURE
To make the sugar-cured jalapeños: In a medium bowl, toss 
together the jalapeño peppers and sugar.
To make the lake trout in foil: Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). 
In a large bowl, toss together the mushrooms, fennel, melted 
butter, and thyme. Season to taste with salt and set aside. 
Tear off a 30-inch (75 cm)-long piece of heavy-duty aluminum 
foil. Place the mushroom mixture in the center of the foil. Lay 
the lemon slices over the mushroom mixture and place the lake 
trout on top of the lemon. Tightly wrap the foil over the fish and 
mushrooms and place the sealed packet on a sheet pan. Bake 
for 25 to 30 minutes until the fish reaches 145°F (63°C) measured 
with an instant-read thermometer. 
To serve: Carefully open the foil packet. Top with some of the 
sugar-cured jalapeños and let your guests dig in!

TextSmoked Trout–
Stuffed Pudgy Pie 
Hash Browns
Pudgy pie makers (two tiny cast-iron pans on the end of two long roasting sticks) are the most ver -
satile pieces of cooking equipment you can use over a campfire. From breakfast to dinner, you can 
pretty much place anything you want in the cookers and make a good meal. This is an easy breakfast 
recipe that takes your basic hash browns and stuffs them with smoked trout. Y ou may run into some 
issues with the potatoes sticking to the pudgy pie maker, so make sure the cooker is well seasoned. 
Y ou’ll also want to make sure it’s warm when you add the butter and that you’ve squeezed as much 
water from the potatoes as possible. If you don’t have butter, nonstick cooking spray works well, too. 
Feel free to open the cooker multiple times during cooking to see how the potatoes are browning. 
Top with an egg and you have a perfect campfire breakfast. If you want to step it up, add some hol -
landaise sauce!
YIELD: Serves 4
INGREDIENTS
4 large russet potatoes, peeled 
and grated
2 teaspoons kosher salt
4 tablespoons (56 g) cold 
unsalted butter
12 ounces (340 g) smoked 
or roasted trout or salmon 
(leftovers work well)
4 large eggsPROCEDURE
Start an open fire with whole logs or in a grill, and let it get hot, 
until there’s a good coal base and the fire is burning strong (see 
page 23) before starting this recipe.
Place the grated potatoes in a large bowl. Cover them with cold 
water and pour out the water. Do this a few times until the water 
is clear and the potatoes aren’t releasing any more starch. Drain 
the potatoes and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Dry the 
bowl and return the drained potatoes to it. Add 2 teaspoons of 
kosher salt.
Rub the cold butter on the inside of the pudgy pie maker until 
there’s a thin coating. Warm your pudgy pie maker directly over 
the fire until it is hot enough to melt the butter, about 2 minutes. 
Tip the pudgy pie maker around to spread the butter until melted 
and the pudgy pie maker is coated.

TextTo each side of the pudgy pie maker, add a tightly packed layer of 
potatoes. Place 2 to 3 ounces (28 to 42 g) of trout in the middle 
of the potatoes on one side only. Close the pudgy pie maker 
and place it over the fire. Cook, flipping and turning, until the 
hash browns are browned, 6 to 8 minutes total, checking after 
3 to 4 minutes and then every 2 minutes or so to ensure they 
don’t burn. 
Once the hash browns are done, heat a large skillet over the fire 
right on the wood. Add a dollop of butter to melt. Crack the eggs 
into the skillet and cook them, sunny-side up, for 4 to 6 minutes 
until the whites are set, holding the pan closer or farther from the 
heat, as needed, making sure not to burn the eggs.
Remove the hash browns from the pudgy pie maker while the 
eggs finish cooking and place them on plates. Top with the fried 
eggs and serve.NOTE 
If you’re not planning on 
keeping your catch, catch-and-
release fishing is an equally 
rewarding experience. When 
practicing catch-and-release 
fishing, do your best to stress 
the fish as little as possible, 
giving it a higher chance 
for survival. Work quickly to 
remove hooks and get the fish 
back into the water as fast 
as possible!

TextSteelhead  
Trout Quiche 
with Fiddleheads, Morels, and Arugula
Steelhead trout and eggs are one of those timeless combinations that pleases just about everyone. 
Turning that combination into quiche amplifies the feeling of a homey, down-to-earth meal. Beyond 
that, this dish screams springtime with the arrival of steelhead and fiddlehead ferns. 
There are two ways to make this dough: I do it the simple way, baking the quiche only one time. 
If you want a crispier crust, blind bake the crust (fill the crust with parchment and dried beans and 
bake until crisp, about 10 minutes) before adding the eggs. Y ou can also take a shortcut and buy a 
premade pie shell.
YIELD: Serves 4 to 6 
INGREDIENTS FOR 
THE DOUGH 
11/2 cups (186 g) all-purpose 
flour, plus more for the 
work surface
12 tablespoons (11/2 sticks, or 
168 g) cold unsalted butter, 
thinly sliced
Pinch kosher salt
1/3 cup (80 ml) ice water
INGREDIENTS FOR 
THE SALAD 
1/4 cup (56.25 g) ramp bottoms, 
thinly sliced 
Juice of 1 large lemon
1 tablespoon (15 ml) 
grapeseed oil
Kosher salt
One 12-ounce (340 g) bag 
baby arugula
1 cup (100 g) fiddlehead 
ferns, blanched PROCEDURE 
To make the dough:  In a large bowl, combine the flour, cold 
butter, and salt. Working quickly, crumble the butter into the flour 
by rubbing it between your clean hands. A little at a time, add the 
ice water and mix the dough until it starts to come together. The 
dough should stick together easily, but it shouldn’t be extremely 
wet. Add just enough water so it’s not crumbling, but still sticks 
together with ease. (Alternatively, you can do this in a food 
processor.) Divide the dough in half. 
On a lightly floured surface, roll out one of the halves to about  
1/8 inch (0.3 cm) thick. Place the rolled dough onto a sheet pan 
and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours until completely chilled. Tightly 
wrap the remaining dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up 
to 3 days or freeze for up to 1 month for future use. 
While the dough chills, make the salad:  In a large nonreactive 
bowl, combine the ramp bottoms and lemon juice. Set aside for  
1 hour to marinate. Whisk in the grapeseed oil and a pinch of salt. 
Add the arugula and fiddleheads. Toss to coat in the dressing.

TextINGREDIENTS FOR 
THE FILLING
1 tablespoon (14 g) unsalted 
butter, plus more for preparing 
the pie plate
1 small shallot, diced
2 garlic cloves, sliced
11/2 cups (99 g) cleaned and 
halved morel mushrooms
Kosher salt 
1 cup (225 g) loosely packed 
diced ramp tops
8 ounces (225 g) leftover 
smoked or roasted steelhead 
trout, shredded
6 large eggs
1 cup (240 ml) heavy cream
Freshly ground black pepperTo make the filling:  In a large sauté pan or skillet over medium 
heat, melt the butter. Add the shallot and garlic. Slowly sweat 
them until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and a 
pinch of salt. Cook until the mushrooms are soft, about 4 minutes, 
stirring occasionally. Add the ramps. Cook for 1 minute. Remove 
the pan from the heat and let cool to room temperature. Add 
the trout. 
In a large bowl, combine the eggs and heavy cream. Using a 
fork, beat until completely combined. Season to taste with salt 
and pepper.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Generously coat a glass pie 
plate with butter.
Remove the rolled dough from the refrigerator and place it into 
the prepared pie plate. Form the dough to fit the plate, removing 
any extra dough hanging over the edge. Spread the mushroom 
and trout mix into the dough. Pour the egg mixture over the top. 
Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked and the 
quiche just starts to develop some color. Remove from the oven 
and set aside. 
To serve: Cut the quiche into 4 to 6 slices. Place one piece on 
each plate and add a handful of salad on the side. Drizzle the 
quiche with any ramp vinaigrette left in the bowl.

TextNewspaper Trout 
I can almost guarantee this recipe was first made by someone who had only newspaper and a few 
trout sitting next to a campfire. Great recipes are often made with a lack of ingredients—forcing you 
to use what you have around you—and I think this is one of those scenarios. At its core, this recipe 
is as minimalistic as it comes . . . well, that is, without the addition of the radicchio salad and maple 
vinaigrette. The bitter greens go well with the sweetened vinaigrette and add a flavor pop to the 
fish. Y ou can use any type of trout, just adjust the cooking time and the amount of paper—the bigger 
the fish, the more paper you’ll need and the longer to cook. I used a large lake trout for this recipe 
and about two sections of the newspaper. Y ou’ll also need parchment paper and butcher’s twine. 
Although I cooked this fish in the oven, this recipe translates well to a grill or over an open fire.
YIELD: Serves 6 to 8
INGREDIENTS 
FOR THE TROUT
One 3- to 4-pound (1.35 to 
1.8 kg) lake trout, gutted 
and scaled
Kosher salt 
Freshly ground black pepper
1 bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley
1 lemon, sliced
INGREDIENTS FOR 
THE SALAD 
2 large heads radicchio, 
quartered through the root end 
so they stay intact
Grapeseed oil, for coating 
the radicchio
Kosher salt
1/2 cup (58 g) chopped oil-
packed sun-dried tomatoes, 
drained, oil reserved for the 
vinaigrette
1/2 cup (68 g) toasted pine nutsPROCEDURE 
To make the trout: Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). 
Season the trout with salt and pepper. Stuff the fish’s cavity with 
the parsley and lemon slices. 
Lay out newspaper so it’s about 6 inches (15 cm) larger than 
your fish on both sides and about 10 layers deep. Place a layer 
of parchment paper over the newspaper. Lay the stuffed trout 
in the middle of the paper and wrap the paper around the fish, 
fully covering it. Using butcher’s twine, tightly tie the newspaper 
around the fish in 5 or 6 places, depending on the size of the fish. 
Fill a clean sink with cold water. Place the newspaper-wrapped 
fish into the sink and let soak for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the 
packet from the water and place it on a sheet pan. Roast for about 
45 minutes, or until the fish reaches an internal temperature of 
145°F (63°C) measured with an instant-read thermometer.
While the fish cooks, make the salad: Heat a large skillet over 
medium-high heat. Lightly oil the cut sides of the radicchio with 
grapeseed oil and season with salt. Working in small batches so 
you don’t crowd the skillet, add the radicchio to the hot skillet, 
cut side down, and sear for about 30 seconds on each cut side, 
or until they begin to brown. The radicchio should have some 
crunch left to it. Once all the radicchio is browned, set aside to 
cool to room temperature. Once cooled, chop into 1-inch (2.5 cm) 
cubes and transfer to a large bowl. Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes 
and toasted pine nuts.

TextFire-Roasted Trout 
on Avocado Toast
I’m a huge fan of cooking things on sticks over an open fire. The simplicity of the process plus the 
depth of flavor it brings to meat makes it a go-to cooking technique for me. This recipe pairs trout 
smoked over an open fire with a clean, bright avocado toast with sweet and spicy jalapeños. I don’t 
think I could imagine a better meal to start a day. 
YIELD: Serves 4 to 6 as  
a snack
INGREDIENTS FOR 
THE TROUT 
One 1-pound (454 g) rainbow 
or brown trout, scaled 
and gutted
Kosher salt 
INGREDIENTS FOR THE 
AVOCADO TOAST
4 ripe avocados, halved 
and pitted
Juice of 2 limes
Kosher salt 
1 loaf artisan whole-grain 
wheat bread, sliced
1 recipe Sugar-Cured 
Jalapeños (page 61; optional)PROCEDURE
Start a fire in your grill with hardwood or lump charcoal (see  
page 23), making sure the fire has a good, hot, coal base.
To make the trout: Find a green wooden stick about 1/2 inch  
(1 cm) wide and long enough to hold over a fire comfortably 
without burning your hands. Position the trout’s stomach cavity 
around the stick. If it’s clumsily on there, cut a little farther down 
into the tail so it can rest comfortably on the stick. Using 4 to 5 
pieces of butcher’s twine, securely tie the fish around the stick. 
Season the fish with salt. Place the fish over the fire, rotating it so 
it cooks evenly. Aim to get the skin a bit crispy and cook it until 
the meat is just cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes, depending on 
how hot your fire is. Once it reaches 145°F (63°C) when measured 
with an instant-read thermometer, set the fish aside to rest. 
While the fish rests, make the avocado toast: Scoop the 
avocado flesh into a medium bowl. Add the lime juice and season 
to taste with salt. Using a fork, mash the avocados. 
Toast the bread.
To serve: Spread the avocado mash over the toast and flake 
some of the trout onto each piece. Garnish with the sugar-cured 
jalapeños (if using) and serve.

Lettuce Wraps
If I was able to cook everything underneath a giant dome of salt, I’m pretty sure that’d be the only 
way I’d cook. Creating a dome of salt gives the fish a higher salinity level, but it also traps in all the 
moisture and produces a soft, buttery texture that’s hard to create using any other method. 
Y ou can serve this with anything you like, but here you’ll find everything you need—I make the 
accoutrements from scratch, but, admittedly, it is a lot of work! Feel free to use store-bought sauces 
or slaws. I’d recommend having something savory, something acidic, something crunchy, something 
spicy, and something fresh. Any combination of those characteristics equals tasty wraps! This makes 
a light, flavorful snack that can be eaten over the course of an afternoon. 
YIELD: Serves 6 to 8; makes 
1 quart (760 g) coleslaw, 2 cups 
(480 ml) sweet and sour sauce, 
2 cups (300 g) quick cucum-
ber pickles, and 1 cup (180 g) 
simmered peppers
INGREDIENTS FOR 
THE WALLEYE
6 pounds (2.7 kg) kosher salt
4 large egg whites
1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon 
(135 ml) water 
Two 1½- to 2½-lb (679 g 
to 1.1 kg) walleyes, gutted 
and scaled
1 lemon, sliced
25 Bibb lettuce leaves
1 cup (125 g) chopped 
toasted cashews
INGREDIENTS FOR THE 
RED CABBAGE COLESLAW 
1/2 head red cabbage, shredded 
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon (15 ml) rice 
wine vinegar 
1/2 teaspoon ground aniseedPROCEDURE
I use a wood-fired oven for this and get it to an internal 
temperature of 600°F (315.5°C). If using a conventional oven, get 
it as hot as possible. 
To make the walleye: In a large bowl, combine the salt, egg 
whites, and water. Mix until well combined. 
On a sheet pan, lay a 1/2-inch (1 cm) layer of the salt mixture. 
Place the walleyes on top of the salt and stuff the cavities of the 
walleyes with the lemon slices. Using the remainder of the salt 
mixture, form a dome around the walleyes so they’re completely 
covered. Pack the salt in so the dome doesn’t have any open 
spaces. It should cover all of the walleyes. Bake for 45 to 50 
minutes. Y ou’ll notice the salt start to brown and harden, which 
is a sure sign the fish is done, or almost done. If you’re unsure 
whether it’s cooked, leave it in the oven for about 10 minutes 
longer. Once the dome is brown and hard, remove the fish from 
the oven and set aside.
While the fish cooks, make the red cabbage coleslaw:  In a large 
bowl, toss the shredded cabbage with the salt. Stir in the vinegar 
and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Sprinkle with the 
aniseed before serving.

INGREDIENTS FOR 
THE QUICK CUCUM -
BER PICKLES
1 English cucumber, 
thinly sliced
Pinch kosher salt
1/2 cup (120 ml) rice vinegar
1/2 cup (120 ml) water 
INGREDIENTS FOR THE 
SIMMERED PEPPERS
11/2 cups (225 g) sliced mixed

Pinch kosher salt To make the sweet and sour sauce: In a 2-quart (1.9 L) saucepan 
over medium heat, combine the pineapple juice, brown sugar, 
vinegar, and soy sauce. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer for 
2 minutes.
In a small bowl, whisk the cornstarch and water until smooth. Add 
this slurry to the simmering liquid, whisking until it thickens. Keep 
warm until needed.
To make the quick cucumber pickles: Place the cucumber slices 
in a medium bowl and sprinkle with the salt. Let sit for 30 minutes. 
Squeeze the cucumbers to get rid of their water and return 
them to the bowl. Add the vinegar and water. Let sit at room 
temperature until needed. 
To make the simmered peppers: In a 2-quart (1.9 L) saucepan 
over medium heat, combine the sliced peppers, water, sugar, 
vinegar, garlic, whole cloves, and salt. Simmer until the peppers 
soften, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and let cool 
to room temperature. Remove and discard the whole cloves 
before serving. 
To serve: Using a clean hammer, crack open the salt dome and 
pull away the chunks of salt. Remove the walleyes from the salt 
and brush away as much salt as possible from the outside and 
the cavity of the fish. Place them onto a cutting board. Remove 
the walleye skins. 
On another board, arranged the lettuce leaves and all the 
accoutrements. Place the toasted cashews in a small bowl. 
Assemble your lettuce wraps with whatever you like!

TextMushroom-
Crusted Walleye 
with Sautéed Spring Vegetables 
Crusting fish and other proteins is something I really love. The addition of dried mushroom adds 
savor to the dish and also gives pale-colored fish a shot of color contrast that creates a stunning 
presentation. This dish uses dried morels to crust the walleye, which echoes the flavors of the mo -
rels in the rest of the dish. As a complete dish, it screams spring with the addition of fava beans 
and asparagus. 
YIELD: Serves 4
INGREDIENTS 
Four 6-ounce (170 g) walleye 
steaks, patted dry
Kosher salt
4 tablespoons (16 g) 
finely ground dried morel 
mushrooms 
Grapeseed oil, for 
cooking the fish 
2 tablespoons (28 g) 
unsalted butter
3 shallots, finely diced
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon (3 g) fresh 
thyme leaves
8 ounces (225 g) fresh 
morel mushrooms, cleaned 
of dirt and cut to an edible 
size, if needed
1/2 cup (120 ml) chicken stock
1 cup (125 g) thinly sliced (on a 
bias) asparagus 
1/2 cup (75 g) fava beans, 
blanched and shelled
1/4 cup (60 g) heavy cream
Freshly squeezed lemon juice, 
for seasoningPROCEDURE
Heat a large sauté pan or skillet over high heat. Season the 
walleye steaks with salt. Coat one side of each steak with  
1 tablespoon (4 g) of the dried morels. Shake off the excess. 
Place enough grapeseed oil in the pan to lightly coat the bottom 
and heat it just until smoking. Place the steaks in the hot pan, 
morel side down, and decrease the heat to medium-high. Sear 
for about 2 minutes until the morels are crusted onto the fish. Flip 
the fish, decrease the heat to medium, and finish cooking the fish 
until cooked through, about 5 minutes more. Transfer the fish to 
paper towels to drain. Keep warm.
Wipe out the sauté pan or skillet and place it over low heat. Add 
the butter to melt. Add the shallots, garlic, and thyme. Cook until 
the shallots are translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. 
Add the morels. Cook until they start to soften a bit and have 
a pleasant texture and flavor, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the chicken 
stock. Cook until reduced to a saucy consistency, 4 to 5 minutes. 
Throw in the asparagus and fava beans and let them warm 
through. Add the heavy cream. Simmer until reduced by half. 
Season to taste with salt and lemon juice 
Place a large spoonful of the spring vegetables on the bottom 
of a bowl with a bit of the sauce. Place a piece of walleye on top 
and serve.

TextWalleye and Wild 
Rice Sausage 
This recipe comes from my friend Jack Riebel, an acclaimed chef and staple of the Minneapolis food 
scene. When I saw his walleye sausage recipe, I knew it had to be in this book. It’s reminiscent of a 
lobster roll, but, with the addition of walleye, I think he’s somehow improved on that. Catch Jack at 
the Lexington in St. Paul, Minnesota—he owns the joint, so he’ll probably stay there—or make this 
recipe at home for a taste from his kitchen!
YIELD: Serves 6 to 8
INGREDIENTS
908 g (2 pounds) walleye 
fillets, skin removed
20 g (0.7 ounce, or about 
1 heaping tablespoon) 
kosher salt
1 g (0.035 ounce) 
ground coriander
0.5 g (0.017 ounce) 
ground ginger
30 g (1 ounce, or about 33/4 
tablespoons) cornstarch 
4 large eggs
480 ml (2 cups) whole milk
82.5 g (2.9 ounces, or about 
1/2 cup) cooked wild rice, 
roughly chopped
12 g (0.4 ounce, or 1/4 cup) 
fresh minced chives
1.2 m (4 feet) natural 
sheep casings
2 tablespoons (28 g) 
unsalted butter, plus more for 
toasting the buns
6 to 8 brioche buns, buttered 
and toasted 
NOTE 
This recipe requires a sau -
sage stuffer, food processor, 
instant-read thermometer, 
and precise scale.PROCEDURE
In a food processor, blend the walleye into a paste, about  
1 minute. Add the salt, coriander, ginger, and cornstarch. Pulse 
until fully combined. Add the eggs. Pulse until incorporated. Add 
the milk and blend until the mixture is homogenous. Transfer to a 
large bowl. Fold in the wild rice and chives. Tightly cover the bowl 
with plastic wrap and refrigerate to cool. 
Once the mixture is chilled, use a sausage stuffer to place 
the mixture into the casings, portioning them to your liking. I 
recommend 31/2 to 41/2 ounces (100 to 115 g) per link. 
Fill an 8-quart (7.7 L) soup pot with 3 inches (7.5 cm) of water and 
place it over medium heat. Bring the water to a low simmer. Add 
the sausage and cover the pot. Poach the fish until they reach an 
internal temperature of 150°F (65.5°C) measured with an instant-
read thermometer. Remove from the poaching liquid and transfer 
to a plate. Chill immediately. 
To reheat the sausages: In a large cast-iron skillet over medium-
high heat, melt the butter. Add the poached sausages. Cook, 
searing on each side, for 4 to 5 minutes total. 
Serve in buttered and toasted brioche buns. I like to coat the 
interior of the buns with a layer of Homemade Aioli (page 87), 
add some chopped romaine lettuce before adding the sausage, 
and then top it all with Sugar-Cured Jalapeños (page 61), Quick 
Cucumber Pickles (page 83), and fresh dill.

TextWalleye in  
Nage Broth
with Fall Vegetables
When making nage broth, fish is gently poached in a lightly seasoned broth and the accompaniments 
are then cooked in the same broth, making for a very aromatic dish—one that’s bright, refreshing, 
and leaves you feeling renewed. The saffron and ginger add unmistakable flavor and distinct color, 
but feel free to include other ingredients, such as clams or mussels, just before serving to make it 
your own. Use any vegetables you like in the broth, but I recommend sticking to vegetables that cook 
quickly. Y ou want them to add some texture without imparting any overly heavy flavors. 
YIELD: Serves 4
INGREDIENTS FOR THE 
NAGE BROTH 
2 quarts (1.9 L) water, light fish 
stock, or clear chicken stock
1/4 cup (60 ml) 
champagne vinegar
1 medium white onion, peeled 
and halved
3 garlic cloves, peeled
2 celery stalks diced 
(large size)
1 fennel bulb, halved
One 2-inch (5 cm) piece fresh 
ginger, peeled 
1 tablespoon (5 g) 
coriander seeds
1 tablespoon (6 g) freshly 
ground black pepper
2 cardamom seeds
2 teaspoons saffron threadsPROCEDURE
To make the nage broth: In a 6-quart (3.8 L) soup pot over high 
heat, combine the water, vinegar, onion, garlic, celery, fennel, 
ginger, coriander, pepper, and cardamom seeds. Bring to a 
simmer. Decrease the heat to medium and simmer the broth, 
uncovered, for about 1 hour, or until it reduces to roughly 1 quart 
(960 ml). Add the saffron threads to the liquid and let steep for 
5 minutes. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer into 
a medium heatproof bowl. If using in the next couple of days, 
refrigerate the broth tightly covered. 
To make the walleye and vegetables: In a large sauté pan or 
skillet over medium heat, bring the nage broth to a gentle simmer. 
Add the walleye steaks and return the liquid to a very gentle 
simmer. Cook for about 4 minutes, or until the steaks reach an 
internal temperature of 145°F (63°C) measured with an instant-
read thermometer. Remove the walleye steaks from the pan and 
set aside.

TextPan-Roasted Walleye 
with Warm Aioli 
Warm aioli smothers the fish in a mouthwatering coating that makes it as succulent as anything I have 
ever tasted. We’re going to use nage broth (page 84) and modify it slightly with the addition of aioli to 
create a completely different experience than the Walleye in Nage Broth with Aromatics (page 84), but  
using very similar ingredients. This dish is advanced, so take your time and don’t become frustrated if 
it doesn’t come out correctly the first time—it will still be delicious. While the ingredients listed will be 
enough for four servings, I advise making the aioli first and following the procedure for the fish, one 
serving at a time, until you get the hang of it. Note that homemade aioli is crucial, as the dish won’t 
turn out right with something store-bought. Y ou will have leftover aioli— save the rest for Walleye BLTs 
(page 92).

INGREDIENTS FOR THE 
HOMEMADE AIOLI 
Juice of 1 small lemon
1 garlic clove, finely minced
2 large egg yolks
11/2 cups (360 ml) grapeseed oil
Kosher salt
INGREDIENTS FOR THE 
WALLEYE AND SAUCE 
Grapeseed oil, for 
cooking the fish
Four 6-ounce (170 g) walleye 
steaks, skin removed, 
patted dry
Kosher salt
2 cups (480 ml) Nage 
Broth (page 84)
1/3 cup (45 g) diced carrots 
1/3 cup (40 g) diced celery
1/3 cup (28 g) diced fennel 
1/3 cup (53 g) diced onion
1/4 cup (60 g) Homemade Aioli
1 tablespoon (3 g) minced 
fresh chives
1 tablespoon (4 g) minced fresh 
flat-leaf parsley
Lemon wedges, for squeezingPROCEDURE
To make the homemade aioli: In a large bowl, combine the 
lemon juice and garlic. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. 
Add the egg yolks and whisk to combine. While whisking 
continually, slowly pour in the grapeseed oil. Continue whisking 
until all the grapeseed oil is emulsified into the egg yolks. 
Taste and season with salt. Tightly cover with plastic wrap and 
refrigerate to chill.
To make the walleye and sauce: Pour enough grapeseed oil 
into a large sauté pan or skillet over high heat to lightly coat the 
bottom. While the pan heats, season the walleye steaks with salt. 
When the pan is hot, place one (or more) walleye steaks, skin 
side down, into the pan. Decrease the heat to medium-high. Cook 
for about 2 minutes. Flip the fish and let it finish cooking, 2 to 3 
minutes more. Remove the walleye from the pan and set aside. 
Drain the pan of oil and return it to low heat. Add 1/4 cup (60 ml) of 
broth to the pan along with one-fourth each of the carrot, celery, 
fennel, and onion. Cook until the broth reduces to just under  
1 tablespoon (15 ml). Remove the pan from the heat and let cool 
for 30 seconds. 
Whisk 1 tablespoon (15 g) of aioli into the broth. Return the pan 
to very low heat if the sauce needs to reduce more. The aioli will 
separate if it gets too hot, so use a gentle hand. Separated mayo 
will have a greasy, unpleasant flavor. 
Season with one-fourth of the chives and parsley and to taste 
with salt and lemon juice. Place the walleye on a plate and pour 
the warm aioli over the top.
Repeat with the remaining ingredients for the remaining servings.

TextBreaded Walleye 
with Charred Jalapeño Tartar Sauce 
Breaded and pan-fried walleye is a classic for a reason—and I don’t see anything taking its place in 
the near future. This recipe has the iconic three-stage breading that provides a crunchy crust. The 
walleye is served with tartar sauce that gets a kick from roasted jalapeños. For the breading, I like to 
use panko bread crumbs and break them up a little finer. I find standard-issue bread crumbs to be too 
fine and panko comes in a bit coarse, so breaking it down a bit makes for the perfect compromise. 
If you make the aioli for the tartar from scratch (see Homemade Aioli, page 87), the entire dish will 
stand out even more! 
YIELD: Serves 4
INGREDIENTS FOR THE 
CHARRED JALAPEÑO 
TARTAR SAUCE 
11/2 cups (340 g) mayonnaise, 
or Homemade Aioli (page 87)
2 tablespoons (18 g) 
diced charred jalapeño 
peppers (see tip)
1 tablespoon (10 g) 
minced shallot
1 tablespoon (9 g) 
minced cornichon
1 tablespoon (9 g) minced 
rinsed capers
1 teaspoon minced fresh dill
1 teaspoon minced fresh flat-
leaf parsley
Kosher salt 
Freshly ground black pepper
Freshly squeezed lemon juice, 
for seasoningPROCEDURE
To make the charred jalapeño tartar sauce: In a medium bowl, 
stir together the mayonnaise, jalapeños, shallot, cornichon, 
capers, dill, and parsley. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and 
lemon juice. Tightly cover and refrigerate until needed.
COOKING TIP
To char the jalapeños:  Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to high 
heat, between 450°F and 550°F (230°C and 290°C). Place the 
jalapeños on the hot grill grate. Cook until they’re black and soft, 
turning as needed. Let cool. Peel away and discard the charred 
skin. Remove and discard the seeds and the stem. Dice the jala -
peños as needed.

6 large eggs, beaten
1 cup (124 g) all-purpose flour
2 cups (100 g) panko bread 
crumbs, lightly crushed
1 tablespoon (3 g) fresh thyme 
leaves, finely minced
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
Eight 4-ounce (115 g) 
walleye fillets
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Grapeseed oil, for

shallow container and the flour in a second shallow container. In 
a third shallow container, stir together the panko, thyme, garlic 
powder, and cayenne. Season the walleye fillets with salt and 
pepper. Working one at a time, coat the fillets on both sides with 
flour, shaking off any excess. Dip the fillets into the egg, remove, 
and place into the panko to coat fully. Set aside.
Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add enough 
grapeseed oil to cover the bottom of the pan generously and let 
it heat until just before smoking. Working in batches, place a few 
walleye fillets into the hot skillet. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until 
browned. Flip and cook until the other side is equally browned 
and the fish is cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer the 
fish to paper towels to drain and continue cooking the remaining 
walleye. Serve immediately with the tartar sauce on the side.

TextWalleye BLTs 
When tomato season rolls around, it’s tough to beat the flavor of a ripe heirloom tomato. When 
paired with thick slabs of roasted bacon, homemade aioli, crisp lettuce, and fried walleye, you’re 
in for a treat. The key to a good BLT lies in all the ingredients being the absolute best they can be, 
so don’t skip any steps! Find some beautiful heirloom tomatoes at a local farmer’s market and track 
down some good bacon. (My favorite is applewood smoked bacon from Nueske’s, in the middle  
of Wisconsin!) 
YIELD: Serves 4
INGREDIENTS 
8 slices bacon 
8 slices whole wheat 
bread, toasted
1/2 cup (115 g) Homemade 
Aioli (page 87)
8 slices heirloom tomato
4 large Bibb lettuce leaves
4 Breaded Walleye Fillets 
(page 90), pan-friedPROCEDURE
To make perfect bacon, skip the sauté pan or skillet. Y ou’ll have 
much more evenly cooked bacon this way! Preheat the oven to 
350° (180°C).
Place the bacon strips on a sheet pan. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, 
or until they’re cooked to your liking. 
To assemble each sandwich: Generously slather 2 pieces 
of toast, each with 1 tablespoonful (15 g) of aioli. In this order 
from bottom to top, on one slice of toast, stack 2 tomato 
slices, 1 lettuce leaf, 1 walleye fillet, and 2 bacon slices. Top 
with the second slice of toast and serve! Repeat with the

TextNorthern Pike 
Dumplings 
in Watercress and Pea Soup 
Due to the bone structure of northern pike, you can often end up with some less-than-ideal fillets for 
cooking. This recipe solves that problem by grinding the meat to get rid of scraps that otherwise might 
not find a home—and it does so with style. These dumplings are soft, clean-tasting, and carry a great 
fish flavor. They’re balanced by the peppery and brightly flavored watercress soup that boasts a bright 
green color enhanced by fresh spring peas. If you’re looking for a more refined experience, strain the 
soup through a fine-mesh strainer. Personally, I say skip the straining and enjoy the chunky bits.
YIELD: Serves 4
INGREDIENTS FOR 
THE DUMPLINGS
1 pound (454 g) northern 
pike, cleaned
3 large eggs
11/2 cups (360 ml) heavy cream
Kosher salt
INGREDIENTS 
FOR THE SOUP
1 tablespoon (14 g) 
unsalted butter
1 large yellow onion, diced
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 pound (454 g) russet 
potatoes, washed, 
peeled, and diced
1 quart (960 ml) clear 
chicken stock
Kosher salt
4 ounces (115 g) sugar snap 
peas, strings removed
8 ounces (225 g) watercress
1 lemon, quartered
Fresh tarragon leaves, for 
garnishingPROCEDURE
To make the dumplings: In a food processor, blend the pike until 
it’s evenly chopped into small bits and looks semismooth. Add 
the eggs. Continue blending for 1 minute more. Add the heavy 
cream and blend until the mixture is smooth. Season to taste with 
salt and blend one last time. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover, 
and refrigerate until completely chilled, about 1 hour. 
To make the soup: In a 4-quart (3.8 L) soup pot over medium 
heat, melt the butter. Add the onion and garlic. Sweat the 
vegetables until soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the potatoes. Cook for 
3 minutes. Add the chicken stock and bring the soup to a simmer. 
Simmer the soup for about 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are 
soft. Pour the soup into a clean container and refrigerate the soup 
base to cool. 
In a large bowl, prepare an ice bath and place a strainer in it. 
Bring a 4-quart (3.8 L) saucepan full of water to a rapid boil over 
high heat. Add enough salt, about 1/4 cup (75 g), to the water to 
make it taste like seawater. Drop in the peas and boil for about 
45 seconds, or until they’re brightly colored and starting to cook. 
Using a slotted spoon, transfer them into the ice bath to cool. 
Remove from the ice bath and refrigerate.
Add the watercress to the boiling water and blanch for 15 
seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to the ice bath to cool.

TextLift the strainer from the ice bath to remove the watercress. 
Squeeze out any excess water. Transfer the cooled vegetables to 
a bowl and refrigerate to keep cool. 
Working in batches, in a standard blender, blend the soup base 
and vegetables until smooth. Taste and season with salt, as 
needed. Transfer to a container and refrigerate while making the 
dumplings. 
To finish the dumplings: Fill a wide 4-quart (3.8 L) saucepan with 
about 4 inches (10 cm) of water. Add 2 tablespoons (36 g) of salt 
to the water to make it taste like seawater. Place the pot over 
high heat and bring to a simmer. Decrease the heat to medium.
Using 2 tablespoons, form small dumplings of the pike mixture 
between the spoons. Place them into the salted simmering water 
and cook for about 2 minutes, or until firm and cooked through.
To finish the soup: While the dumplings cook, place the soup 
over medium heat to warm. When the soup and dumplings are 
ready, ladle some soup into a bowl and place a few dumplings 
into the soup.
Garnish with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a sprinkle of 
tarragon and serve.

TextNorthern Pike 
Cooked in Butter 
with Stewed Tomatoes, Arugula,  
and Torn Bread 
Gently cooking fish in a fat—in this case, butter—is an easy way to bring the delicate flavors out of it. 
The butter slowly cooks the fish while keeping its moisture locked in, giving it a buttery flavor. Place 
that on some fresh stewed tomatoes with olives and capers and you have yourself a nice little meal!
YIELD: Serves 4
INGREDIENTS
4 large tomatoes
1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil
2 garlic cloves, sliced
1 shallot, minced
2 tablespoons (13 g) minced 
Castelvetrano olives 
1 tablespoon (9 g) capers, 
rinsed and drained
1 tablespoon (4 g) minced fresh 
oregano leaves
4 pounds (1.8 kg) 
unsalted butter
Four 8-ounce (225 g) 
pike fillets
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
4 handfuls arugula
1/4 cup (60 ml) sun-dried tomato 
vinaigrette (see Newspaper 
Trout, page 71)
16 large croutons, 
preferably homemadePROCEDURE
Bring a 4-quart (3.8 L) pot filled with water to a boil over 
high heat. 
On the bottom of each tomato, using a sharp paring knife, cut 
a small X that just pierces the skin. Place the tomatoes into the 
boiling water for approximately 45 seconds, or until you see the 
skin start to peel away from the tomato where it was cut. Using 
a large slotted spoon, remove the tomatoes and run them under 
cool water until cooled. With a paring knife, peel back the tomato 
skins from where the X was made. Dice the tomatoes and set 
them aside. 
In a large sauté pan or skillet over medium heat, combine the 
olive oil, garlic, and shallot. Cook for about 3 minutes until 
translucent. Add the diced tomatoes. Cook them down until 
most of the moisture has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Stir in 
the olives and capers. Sauté for 1 minute more. Sprinkle in the 
oregano. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside. 
In a 4-quart (3.8 L) saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter 
and heat it to about 160°F (71°C) measured with an instant-read 
thermometer.

TextSeason the pike with salt and pepper. Place a small metal trivet 
or silicone steamer rack into the butter so the fish doesn’t lie on 
the bottom of the pan. Place the fish on the rack. Cook until it 
reaches an internal temperature of 150°F (65.5°C) measured with 
an instant-read thermometer, about 12 minutes. Using a slotted 
spatula, remove the cooked fish from the butter and place it on 
paper towels to drain.
Place the stewed tomatoes on a serving plate and top them with 
the fish. 
In a large bowl, toss together the arugula, vinaigrette, and 
croutons. Serve the salad on the side.

TextBaked  
Northern Pike 
with Butter Beans and Bacon 
This recipe requires a strong, flavorful broth, which is why I recommend one that’s homemade. Roast -
ing a chicken carcass, covering it in water, and simmering it for 4 hours will get you the stock that 
makes the difference in the dish, or use Basic Fish Stock (page 151). If you make your own chicken 
stock, keep the roasted chicken bones covered with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water the entire time it is 
cooking. The broth is then simmered with aromatics, bacon, beans, and herbs, all of which make the 
broth taste even better and stronger. If you already have the stock on hand, this is an easy, delicious, 
quick meal.
YIELD: Serves 4
INGREDIENTS
4 thick slices smoked 
bacon, diced
2 shallots, diced
2 garlic cloves, sliced
2 teaspoons minced fresh 
thyme leaves
1 teaspoon finely minced fresh 
rosemary leaves
1 Thai chile, sliced
2 handfuls chopped kale
1 (15-ounce, or 425 g) can 
butter beans, drained
2 cups (480 ml) roasted 
chicken stock (see headnote)
1 tablespoon (14 g) 
unsalted butter
Four 8-ounce (225 g) 
pike fillets
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 lemon, quarteredPROCEDURE
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
In a large sauté pan or skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon 
until crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour off most of the fat, reserving 
about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) in the pan. Add the shallots and garlic. 
Sauté until the shallots are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the 
thyme, rosemary, and Thai chile. Sauté for 1 minute more.
Add the kale, butter beans, and chicken stock to the pan. Bring to 
a simmer and let cook for 1 minute. Add the butter and let it melt.
Season the pike with salt and pepper and place it into a  
9 x 13-inch (23 x 33 cm) baking dish. Pour the broth and bean 
mixture from the pan over the fish. Bake for 20 minutes, or until 
the fish is fully cooked and reaches an internal temperature of 
145°F (63°C) measured with an instant-read thermometer.
To serve: Scoop some beans with the fish into a bowl. Squeeze 
fresh lemon juice over the top and serve.

TextCilantro and 
Jalapeño–Cured 
Pike
Curing fish in this fashion is similar to the Salt, Sugar, and Dill–Cured Salmon (page 51), but the jala -
peños and cilantro here add a distinct punch to the fish. It takes best to a lighter-flavored fish such 
as pike, but you can experiment with other fish, as you prefer. 
YIELD: Serves 8 to 12 as  
a snack 
INGREDIENTS
1 cup (300 g) kosher salt 
3/4 cup (150 g) sugar
6 jalapeños, stemmed, seeded, 
and grated 
2 bunches fresh cilantro, 
roughly chopped, 1 cup (16 g) 
reserved for garnishing
3 pounds previously frozen 
(1.36 kg) skin-off pike 
fillets, cleaned 
Tortilla chips, for serving
Crème fraîche, for serving
Fresh limes, for servingPROCEDURE 
In a small bowl, stir together the salt, sugar, jalapeños, and 
cilantro. Sprinkle one-third of the salt, sugar, and herb mixture 
over the bottom of a glass baking dish large enough to hold the 
fish comfortably. Place half the pike fillets, skin side down, in the 
dish. Sprinkle the flesh side with the same amount of the salt 
mixture. Place the remaining pike fillets, skin side up, on top of 
the first half. Sprinkle the remaining salt mixture over the top of 
the fillets. Cover the fish directly with plastic wrap and weigh it 
down with something weighty, but not too heavy—say, a six-pack 
of beer. Place them in the refrigerator. Flip and drain the fillets 
every 12 hours for 48 hours.
Wipe off any excess salt mixture from the fillets. Remove the skin 
and thinly slice the pike before serving on tortilla chips topped 
with crème fraîche, sprinkled with fresh lime juice, and garnished 
with cilantro.

TextPerch Brandade 
This dish is classically made with salted and dried cod, but it translates to fresh fish well. With perch, 
I skip the dried and salted part, use fresh fish, and love the result. It’s then whipped with boiled pota -
toes, garlic, grapeseed oil, and cream and served over toast. Y ou can eat this chilled on bread or you 
can broil it, cover it in paprika, and spread it over toast.
YIELD: Serves 4 to 6 as  
a snack 
INGREDIENTS
1 pound (454 g) perch fillets, 
skin removed
1 cup (240 ml) grapeseed oil, 
plus more for coating the fish
Kosher salt 
6 garlic cloves, peeled
8 ounces (225 g) russet 
potatoes, washed and diced
1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy cream
1 teaspoon minced fresh 
thyme leaves
1 tablespoon (15 ml) freshly 
squeezed lemon juice
8 to 12 slices baguette, toasted PROCEDURE
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). 
Coat the perch with a bit of grapeseed oil and season with salt. 
Place the perch on a sheet pan. Bake for 7 to 9 minutes, or until 
the fish is fully cooked and reaches an internal temperature of 
145°F (63°C) measured with an instant-read thermometer. Remove 
from the oven and refrigerate to cool. 
In a 1-quart (960 ml) saucepan over low heat, combine the 
grapeseed oil and garlic. Lightly simmer the garlic for 30 minutes, 
or until soft. Don’t let the garlic get black; it will get bitter. Remove 
from the heat and let cool. Once cool, remove the garlic and 
mash it. Return it to the oil. Set aside.
Bring a 2-quart (1.9 L) saucepan full of lightly salted water to a 
simmer over medium heat. Add the potatoes. Cook until soft, 
about 15 minutes. Strain. 
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, 
combine the garlic oil, potatoes, and perch. Turn the mixer to 
medium speed and slowly add the heavy cream and thyme. Mix 
until combined. Taste and season with salt and lemon juice, as 
needed. Spread the brandade on the toast and enjoy.

TextPerch and  
Potato Chowder
In my opinion, fish and potato chowder should focus on two things—the fish and the potatoes (okay, 
sure, and bacon). Yukon golds are my favorite potatoes for this recipe as they add a buttery flavor 
and also have great texture in a chowder. A few big handfuls of fish are added right at the end of the 
cooking process, and gently cooked to perfection, to add a perch flavor to the chowder. 
YIELD: Serves 8 to 10
INGREDIENTS 
8 ounces (225 g) bacon, diced
1 large yellow onion, diced
2 garlic cloves, sliced
2 tablespoons (6 g) minced 
fresh thyme leaves
2 pounds (908 g) Yukon 
gold potatoes, washed, 
peeled, and diced
2 quarts (1.9 L) chicken stock
1 cup (240 ml) heavy cream
2 pounds (908 g) boneless, 
skinless perch, cut into 
large pieces
Kosher salt 
Freshly ground black pepper 
Handful minced fresh chivesPROCEDURE
In a 6-quart (5.8 L) soup pot over medium heat, cook the bacon 
until crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain the fat, reserving 1 tablespoon 
(15 ml) in the bottom of the pot. Add the onion, garlic, and thyme 
to the reserved bacon fat. Cook until the onion and garlic are 
softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the potatoes. Cook for 1 to 2 
minutes to warm. Add the chicken stock and bring the chowder 
to a simmer. Simmer until the potatoes are just soft, 15 to 
20 minutes. 
Add the heavy cream and bring the chowder back to a simmer. 
Add the perch. Cook the perch for about 5 minutes, or until it’s 
fully cooked and reaches an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C) 
measured with an instant-read thermometer.
Taste and season with salt and pepper. Finish with the chives just 
before serving.

TextPan-Fried Crappie 
with Wild Rice and Grain Salad 
When it comes to crappie, keeping the fish whole and searing it helps keep in moisture and elim -
inates the waste you might get when butchering the fish. On top of that, the skin, when crisped, 
is as delicious as any other part of the fish. This recipe pairs crappie with a grain salad containing 
fresh herbs and radish that’s brightened by a champagne vinaigrette. The grains in the salad can be 
cooked a day or two ahead to make for less work the day you serve this, but should be brought to 
room temperature before serving. 
YIELD: Serves 4
INGREDIENTS
4 whole crappies, scaled, 
gutted, and patted dry (this 
helps crisp the skin and 
minimizes splattering when the 
fish goes into the pan) 
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
8 lemon slices, plus more for 
seasoning the salad (optional)
12 sprigs tarragon 
Grapeseed oil, for cooking
1 cup (165 g) cooked wild rice 
1 cup (100 g) cooked farro 
1 cup (100 g) cooked 
rye berries 
4 radishes, thinly sliced 
1/2 cup (70 g) diced 
seeded cucumber 
1 teaspoon minced fresh 
thyme leaves
1 tablespoon (3 g) minced 
fresh chives 
1 tablespoon (4 g) minced fresh 
flat-leaf parsley
1 recipe sundried tomato 
vinaigrette (page 71)PROCEDURE
Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. 
While the skillet heats, season the cavities of the crappies with 
salt and pepper. Stuff them with the lemon slices and tarragon. 
Lightly coat the bottom of the skillet with grapeseed oil and 
gently lay the fish in the pan. Decrease the heat to medium-high. 
Brown the fish on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Remove the 
fish when it is fully cooked and reaches an internal temperature 
of 145°F (63°C) measured with an instant-read thermometer. Place 
it on paper towels to drain while you prepare the salad. 
In a large bowl, stir together the cooked grains, radishes, 
cucumber, and herbs. Add the vinaigrette. Stir to combine. Taste 
and adjust the seasoning, as needed. Give it a squeeze of fresh 
lemon juice to make the flavors pop, if desired. Place the salad on 
plates. Pull the crappie meat and skin off the body and place over 
the salad.

roasted in paper with lemons and other aromatics, then blended with butter and herbs and placed 
into pots. It’s then covered with another layer of room-temperature butter and refrigerated for up to 
five days. That’s it!
YIELD: Serves 6 to 8 as  
a snack
INGREDIENTS FOR THE 
MARINATED CUCUMBERS
1 English cucumber, halved 
lengthwise
2 anchovies, minced
1 small shallot, minced
1 garlic clove, minced
1 tablespoon (15 ml) 
champagne vinegar
3 tablespoons (45 ml) 
grapeseed oil
1 tablespoon (4 g) minced 
fresh dill
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper PROCEDURE
To make the marinated cucumbers: Start a fire in the grill with 
lump charcoal and heat to roughly 500°F (250°C; see page 23). 
Place the cucumber halves, cut side down, on the grill grate. Grill 
for about 2 minutes until they have good grill marks. Remove 
from the grill and let cool. Alternatively, you can do this in a grill 
pan on the stovetop. Refrigerate until chilled. Cut the chilled 
cucumber into a medium-small dice and transfer to a medium 
nonreactive bowl. Add the anchovies, shallot, garlic, and vinegar. 
Let sit for 30 minutes. 
Add the grapeseed oil and dill and toss to combine. Taste and 
season with salt and pepper. Keep refrigerated, for up to 5 days, 
until needed.

TextINGREDIENTS FOR 
THE TERRINES
Grapeseed oil, for cooking
2 lemons, sliced
Eight 3- to 4-ounce (85 to 
115 g) crappie fillets
Kosher salt 
Freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon (7 g) ground 
celery seed 
2 cups (480 ml) melted 
clarified unsalted butter, at 
room temperature
2 tablespoons (8 g) minced 
fresh flat-leaf parsley
2 tablespoons (8 g) minced 
fresh dill 
1 teaspoon freshly squeezed 
lemon juice
4 garlic cloves, 
minced to shredsTo make the terrines: Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a 
sheet pan with parchment paper. 
Coat the paper with a thin layer of grapeseed oil and place the 
lemon slices around the parchment paper. Lay the crappie fillets 
over the lemons and season the fish with salt, pepper, and celery 
seed. Cover the fillets with another piece of parchment paper. 
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the fish is fully cooked and 
reaches an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C) measured with  
an instant-read thermometer. 
Flake the cooked fish into a large bowl. Stir in 1/3 cup (80 ml) of 
butter, the parsley, dill, lemon juice, and garlic. Taste and season 
with salt and pepper until you like the flavor. Place the crappie 
into a 6-ounce (90 ml) jar and tightly pack it down. Top the fish 
with 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) of butter and refrigerate to chill. 
I recommend serving this over toast with the marinated 
cucumbers on the side.
COOKING TIP  
Keep the clarified butter at room temperature so that it binds 
nicely with the fish when mixing. If it’s too hot or too cold mixing 
will be more difficult.

TextBluegill 
with Ginger, Thai Chile, and Garlic Oil 
Bluegills are another prime candidate for cooking whole (see tip). Scaling them rather than butch -
ering can save a bunch of meat and the skin crisps up perfectly. If you have a hot grill and a pile of 
bluegills, this is a perfect and delicious way to cook them. Start with a clean grill with oiled grates and 
mix some wood chunks in with the charcoal for an additional flavor kick. Y ou’ll probably have leftover 
oil, which can live in the refrigerator for two weeks and is great on any protein!
YIELD: Serves 6 to 8
INGREDIENTS 
1 cup (240 ml) grapeseed oil, 
plus more for coating the fish
10 Thai chiles, minced
One 4-inch (10 cm) piece fresh 
ginger, peeled and minced
4 garlic cloves, minced
16 whole blue gills, scaled 
and gutted 
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper PROCEDURE
In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the grapeseed 
oil, chiles, ginger, and garlic. Slowly cook until they just begin 
to brown, about 6 minutes, and immediately pull the pan off 
the heat. 
Start a fire in your grill with a mix of natural lump charcoal and 
hickory chunks and let it get hot (see page 23). Alternatively, heat 
a gas grill to between 450°F and 550°F (230°C and 290°C).
Season the bluegills with salt and pepper and give them a light 
coating of grapeseed oil. Place the fish on the grill. Cook for 4 to 
5 minutes per side until the fish is fully cooked and reaches an 
internal temperature of 145°F (63°C) measured with an instant-
read thermometer and has solid grill marks. Transfer the fish to 
a plate. Remove the meat from the bluegills and serve with the 
garlic oil for dipping, or pour a little oil over the fish and serve.
COOKING TIP
When grilling whole fish, you want to move the fish as little as 
possible. Let the fish cook all the way through on one side before 
flipping it. This lets the skin release from the grates more eas -
ily and also forms a better crust on the fish. Aim for the darkest 
brown color possible without turning the skin black.

TextChopped Bluegill 
and Corn Chowder 
Similar to the Perch and Potato Chowder  (page 104), this recipe focuses heavily on its main ingredients. 
It’s all about the corn at first, with the bluegill coming in at the last minute to add some depth of flavor. 
The corn and fish pair perfectly to make a satisfying late-summer or fall meal. 
YIELD: Serves 6 to 8 
INGREDIENTS
5 ears corn, shucked, 
kernels cut from the cobs, 
cobs quartered
1 tablespoon (14 g) 
unsalted butter
1 yellow onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, sliced
1 jalapeño pepper, minced
2 medium Yukon gold 
potatoes, diced
1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy cream 
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Grapeseed oil, for preparing 
the sheet pan
2 pounds (908 g) skin-off 
bluegill fillets
1 tablespoon (4 g) minced flat-
leaf parsley
1 lemon, slicedPROCEDURE
In a 4-quart (3.8 L) soup pot over low heat, combine the corncobs 
with enough water to cover by 2 inches (5 cm). Simmer the cobs 
for 1 to 2 hours. Once the corncobs are soft and the broth is 
flavorful, strain the cobs from the water and reserve the resulting 
stock. Measure the broth and add enough cold water to equal  
6 cups (1.4 L) of corn stock. Reserve and refrigerate 1/2 cup (120 ml) 
of the stock to thin the soup. Set the remaining stock aside.
Return the pot to medium heat and add the butter to melt. 
Add the onion, garlic, and jalapeño. Sweat the vegetables 
until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the potatoes and corn 
stock. Simmer the chowder until the potatoes are tender, 15 to 
20 minutes. 
Add the heavy cream and corn. Cook for 5 minutes more, or until 
the corn is soft. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Remove 
the pot from the heat and let the chowder cool for about 30 
minutes until it’s safe to blend. 
Working in batches, in a standard blender, blend the soup until 
completely smooth. If serving immediately, adjust the consistency, 
if needed, or cool overnight, thin with the reserved broth, and 
rewarm before serving. 
About 15 minutes before you’re ready to serve the soup, 
preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Lightly coat a sheet pan with 
grapeseed oil.
Place the bluegill fillets on the prepared pan and season with 
salt. Lightly coat the fillets with grapeseed oil. Bake for 10 to 12 
minutes, or until they’re cooked through and reach an internal 
temperature of 145°F (63°C) measured with an instant-read 
thermometer.

of the bluegill into a bowl and ladle warm corn chowder over the 
fish. Give the bowl of chowder a squeeze of fresh lemon juice 
and serve.
COOKING TIP
This chowder will thicken significantly overnight and improve in 
flavor. If you can, let it sit overnight before serving and adjust the 
consistency the next day. Because you’re making corn stock for 
this chowder anyway, just save a little for the next day to thin the 
soup. If you don’t have extra broth, water works just as well.

TextBluegill en 
Papillote  
As I mentioned on page 61, fish en papillote  is a classic French fish preparation that sounds fancier 
than it is. Similar to cooking in aluminum foil, cooking en papillote  means cooking in parchment 
paper with some aromatics, wine, and vinegar. To serve, the paper is carefully opened in front of the 
guest, who is met with the fragrant aroma from the contents. It’s a great preparation for fish that can 
be prepped ahead and chilled to make serving dinner guests a breeze. 
YIELD: Serves 4
INGREDIENTS
2 carrots, julienned
2 zucchini, julienned
2 large shallots, julienned
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
8 sprigs thyme
4 teaspoons (20 ml) white wine
Eight 3- to 4-ounce (85 to  
115 g) skin-off bluegill fillets
Kosher salt
2 lemons, sliced
4 teaspoons (18.6 g) 
unsalted butterPROCEDURE
Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
Cut four 24 x 16-inch (60 x 35 cm) pieces of parchment paper into 
large heart shapes, about the size of two footballs next to each 
other. Place one-fourth of the carrots, zucchini, shallots, garlic, 
thyme, and wine on the bottom of one side of a paper heart. 
Season the bluegill fillets with salt and place 2 fillets on the 
vegetables. Place 1 teaspoon (4.7 g) butter and a few lemon 
slices on top of the fish and fold the paper over the top of the 
fish. Crimp together the sides of the parchment to seal the 
packet. Repeat the process with the remaining fish, vegetables, 
and packets. Place the packets on a sheet pan and bake for 
15 minutes. 
Remove from the oven and serve immediately, being careful of 
the hot steam when opening the packets.

TextCatfish Tacos 
with Crema and Tomatillo Salsa 
When making tacos, I try to make a bunch at once. It seems like you always manage to find a few 
more mouths to feed if you get a good round of tacos going. Here in Minneapolis, there’s a Mexican 
restaurant that sells fresh masa and its improved the quality of my tacos infinitely. Check your local 
Mexican markets to see if they sell fresh masa. If not, making tortillas from masa flour or lightly grilled 
corn tortillas also work great.  
YIELD: Serves 8 to 12

1 quart (248 g) snow 
peas, blanched and sliced 
on the bias
1 recipe Sugar-Cured 
Jalapeños (page 61)
Limes, for squeezingPROCEDURE
Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). 
To make the tomatillo salsa: Place the husked tomatillos on a 
sheet pan. Bake for 15 minutes until they develop some color and 
have softened. 
In a large sauté pan or skillet over medium heat, heat 1 
tablespoon (15 ml) of grapeseed oil. Add the garlic, onion, and 
jalapeño. Sauté until softened, about 6 minutes. Transfer the 
vegetables to a large bowl to cool. 
When the tomatillos are done cooking, add them to the bowl 
and let everything cool. Transfer the cooled mixture to a food 
processor and add the cilantro. Pulse to chop roughly. Taste and 
season with salt and lime juice. Set aside. 
To make the tacos: Season the catfish fillets with a liberal amount 
of Creole seasoning. 
In a large sauté pan or skillet over high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of 
grapeseed oil until it’s just about smoking. Decrease the heat to 
medium-high. Working in batches, add the fish to the hot pan and 
cook until it’s cooked through, about 7 minutes, flipping a couple 
of times. It’s done when it reaches an internal temperature of 
145°F (63°C) measured with an instant-read thermometer.
Place a scoop of hot beans on a taco shell followed by catfish, 
crema, snow peas, jalapeño, and tomatillo salsa. Squeeze on 
some lime juice. Repeat and enjoy!

When you talk about satisfying comfort food and fish, fish cakes are always on the top of my list. The 
texture and flavor of catfish work perfectly in these cakes and go great with the spicy tartar sauce. 
Don’t overmix the ingredients or you’ll end up with a gummy cake! When mixed just right, it should 
melt in your mouth.

INGREDIENTS
1 pound (454 g) 
catfish, cleaned 
Grapeseed oil, for preparing 
and cooking the fish
Kosher salt 
2 cups (180 g) crushed salty

form patties. 
Heat a large sauté pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Add a 
thin coating of grapeseed oil to the skillet and heat until it just 
about starts to smoke. 
Lightly dust the cakes with flour. Add them to the hot skillet and 
brown until warmed throughout, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve with a 
squeeze of fresh lemon juice and the tartar sauce on the side.

TextCatfish Tikin Xic 
(Mexican-Style Catfish)
This catfish recipe was developed by my buddy Jorge Guzman, who has a few James Beard Award 
nominations under his belt. Every one of his dishes that I’ve tried has been dynamic, thought-  
provoking, culturally significant, and downright delicious. This recipe stems from his Mexican heri -
tage and will leave any guest at your house speechless. 
YIELD: Serves 6 to 8
INGREDIENTS FOR THE 
FRIJOLES CHARROS
2 quarts (2 kg) dried 
black beans 
1 ham hock
1/2 cup (112 g) lard or butter
2 carrots, diced 
2 celery stalks, diced
2 jalapeño peppers, diced
1 yellow onion, diced 
1 Fresno chile, diced 
1 tablespoon (10 g) 
minced garlic
1 cup (240 g) ketchup
1 cup (240 g) Dijon mustard
1 cup (225 g) packed light 
brown sugar
1/4 cup (85 g) molasses
2 tablespoons (30 g) 
chipotle purée
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 herb sachet (bay leaf, 
thyme, rosemary)
2 quarts (1.9 L) chicken stock, 
plus more as needed
Kosher saltPROCEDURE 
To make the frijoles charros: In a 6-quart (5.8 L) pot, combine the 
dried beans with enough water to cover by 4 inches (10 cm). Bring 
to a boil over high heat. As soon as they boil, remove them from 
the heat. Let soak in the warm water for 1 hour. Drain the beans in 
a colander and rinse them with cold water. Set aside. 
In a 6-quart (5.8 L) soup pot over medium heat, combine the ham 
hock, lard, carrots, celery, jalapeños, onion, Fresno chile, and 
garlic. Sauté for about 6 minutes. 
Add the remaining ingredients, except the chicken stock and 
black beans. Cook for 3 minutes. 
Stir in the chicken stock and black beans. Cook for 1 to 2 hours, 
or until the beans are soft. If the beans get dry, add a bit more 
chicken stock. Taste and season with salt. Remove the sachet and 
discard the ham hock. Refrigerate overnight if using the next day. 
COOKING TIP
Make the beans and onions a day in advance so you only have to

TextINGREDIENTS FOR 
PICKLED RED ONIONS
1 quart (960 ml) distilled 
white vinegar
1 quart (960 ml) water
Juice of 1 lime
1 tablespoon (9 g) peppercorns
1 tablespoon (5 g) 
coriander seeds
1 jalapeño pepper, halved 
lengthwise 
1 sprig marjoram 
Big pinch sea salt
Big pinch sugar
2 large red onions, thinly sliced 
INGREDIENTS 
FOR THE FISH
Six 6- to 8-ounce (170 to 225 g) 
catfish fillets
4 dried guajillo chiles
1/2 cup (120 ml) freshly 
squeezed orange juice
1/2 cup (120 ml) freshly 
squeezed lime juice
1/2 cup (128 g) achiote paste
2 tablespoons (30 ml) distilled 
white vinegar
1 beefsteak tomato, charred 
and coarsely chopped
1/2 white onion, charred and 
coarsely chopped
10 garlic cloves, roasted
2 whole cloves, stemmed 
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice 
2 tablespoons (30 g) sea salt
2 tablespoons (30 ml) 
grapeseed oil
2 large banana leaves
Warm tortillas, for servingTo make the pickled red onions: In a 6-quart (5.8 L) saucepan 
over medium heat, combine the vinegar, water, lime juice, 
peppercorns, coriander seeds, jalapeño, marjoram, salt, and 
sugar. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes. Remove the 
mixture from the heat and let cool.
Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours, and up to 5 days. Drain the 
onions from the liquid before using.
To make the fish: Preheat a griddle, grill, or skillet over 
medium heat 
Place the catfish in a baking dish large enough to hold all pieces. 
Bring a kettle of water to a simmer over high heat. Place the 
guajillo chiles on the griddle. Toast them just long enough to get 
a little color on both sides, about 20 seconds per side. Transfer 
the chiles to a medium bowl and cover with simmering water. Let 
soak for about 10 minutes to soften. Remove the chiles from the 
water. Remove and discard the stems and seeds.
In a standard blender, combine the rehydrated guajillos, the 
orange juice, lime juice, achiote paste, vinegar, tomato, onion, 
garlic, whole cloves, allspice, salt, and grapeseed oil. Purée until 
completely smooth. Pour the marinade over the fish, turning it to 
coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate to marinate 
for at least 30 minutes, and up to 6 hours 
Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). 
Remove the fish from the refrigerator and remove the plastic 
wrap. Lay your banana leaves out on a kitchen counter. Wipe 
both sides with a damp towel to clean. In a separate baking dish 
of similar size, lay the banana leaves on the bottom of the dish. 
Place the fish on the leaves and cover with the marinade. Fold 
the leaves over the fish to cover completely. 
Bake the fish for 15 to 20 minutes, or until it reaches 145°F (63°C) 
measured with an instant-read thermometer. Remove from the 
oven and carefully open the banana leaves to allow steam to 
escape. Serve immediately with warm tortillas, pickled red onions, 
and black beans.

TextSteamed Catfish 
with Northern Thai Coconut Curry 
I grew up in a small city in Wisconsin that had a large Hmong community. They opened my eyes to 
a style of cooking I wouldn’t otherwise have known, and I developed a deep appreciation of it. So, 
when Yia Vang of Union Kitchen hit the Minneapolis food scene, I couldn’t have been more excited to 
try his food. His recipes are drenched in culture and have intense, full flavors that honor his cooking 
roots. They also look extraordinarily beautiful. Everything he makes turns into a memorable meal, 
and this is no exception. Serve with rice or sticky rice, if desired.
YIELD: Serves 4 to 6
INGREDIENTS FOR THE 
CURRY SAUCE
1/3 cup (50 g) minced 
lemongrass
1/2 cup (80 g) minced 
white onion
1/4 cup (25 g) minced 
peeled galangal
1/4 cup (25 g) minced peeled 
fresh ginger
¼ cup (34 g) minced garlic
4 kaffir lime leaves
2 roasted red bell 
peppers, diced
One 8-ounce (225 g) can 
crushed tomatoes
1/3 cup (85 g) red curry paste
1/3 cup (80 ml) grapeseed oil 
2 quarts (1.9 L) coconut milk  
(I like Chaokoh brand)
Kosher saltPROCEDURE 
To make the curry sauce: In a large sauté pan or skillet over 
medium heat, combine the lemongrass, onion, galangal, ginger, 
garlic, lime leaves, roasted red peppers, and crushed tomatoes. 
Sauté for about 5 minutes. 
Stir in the curry paste and grapeseed oil. Decrease the heat to 
medium-low. Cook until a brown crust forms on the bottom of the 
pan (be careful not to burn anything though), about 15 minutes. 
Add the coconut milk. Simmer the curry for 15 to 20 minutes. 
Working in batches as needed, transfer the curry sauce to a 
standard blender and blend until smooth. Strain the sauce 
through a fine-mesh strainer into the pan and place it over 
medium heat. Cook until reduced to a stewlike consistency, about 
10 minutes. Taste and season with salt. Keep warm over low heat 
while you cook the fish.

TextSturgeon and 
Roast Beets 
with Yogurt, Grapefruit, and Arugula Salad 
I used to cook a dish similar to this in New Y ork City at one of my favorite restaurants. It was a crowd 
favorite, and I hope you like it as well. The steaklike texture and umami flavor the sturgeon brings 
works great alongside the bright yogurt, fresh grapefruit, and arugula. 
YIELD: Serves 4
INGREDIENTS
Kosher salt
4 medium red beets
1 cup plain full-fat Greek yogurt 
1 tablespoon (4 g) minced fresh 
tarragon leaves
1 tablespoon (20 g) honey
Four 6-ounce (170 g) skin-off 
sturgeon fillets
Freshly ground black pepper 
Grapeseed oil, for 
cooking the fish
1 tablespoon (15 ml) 
champagne vinegar
4 handfuls arugula 
2 grapefruits, peeled, 
supremes segmented, 
juice reservedPROCEDURE
Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). 
In a 9-inch (23 cm) square baking dish, place 1/2-inch (1 m) layer  
of salt. Place the beets on top of the salt. Wrap the dish in 
aluminum foil. Bake until the beets are cooked through, about  
1 hour. Remove the beets, let cool enough to handle, peel, cut 
into eighths, and set aside. 
In a small bowl, whisk the yogurt, tarragon, and honey until 
blended. Taste and season with salt. Set aside. 
Season the sturgeon fillets with salt and pepper. Heat a large 
sauté pan or skillet over high heat. Add a coating of grapeseed 
oil to the pan and let it heat until it just begins to smoke. 
Decrease the heat to medium-high. Add the fillets. Sear for 3 to 
5 minutes per side and continue cooking until they’re cooked 
through to a temperature of 145°F (63°C) measured with an 
instant-read thermometer, 7 to 8 minutes total. 
In a small bowl, toss together the beets and vinegar. Season to 
taste with salt. 
In a medium bowl, toss the arugula with the grapefruit supremes 
and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the reserved grapefruit juice.
To serve: Place a large dollop of honeyed yogurt on a plate. Top 
the yogurt with a couple spoonfuls of beets. Place a piece of fish 
on the side and garnish with arugula salad.

TextGrilled Sturgeon 
with Anchovy Butter and Rapini 
Sturgeon is one of my favorites because it eats like a big, meaty, lightly flavored beef steak. The meat 
holds up well to grilling and can take on a lot of delicious flavors. For this recipe, I treat it like a steak, 
pairing it with my favorite condiment, anchovy butter, to give the dish more savor. Gently cooked 
rapini, broccoli, or broccolini completes the dish. The sauce is a pan sauce made with the anchovy 
butter and rapini. The recipe for the anchovy butter is more than you’ll need, but it’s worth making 
extra to have around the house for toast, or if you like extra in the sauce like I do. Don’t be afraid of 
anchovies and definitely don’t skimp on the butter sauce! 
YIELD: Serves 4
INGREDIENTS FOR THE 
ANCHOVY BUTTER
16 tablespoons (2 sticks, or 
224 g) salted butter, at room 
temperature
4 anchovies, boned
1 tablespoon (15 ml) freshly 
squeezed lemon juice
1 tablespoon (4 g) minced 
fresh parsley
1 tablespoon (9 g) capers, 
drained and chopped
1 small garlic clove, peeled 
INGREDIENTS FOR THE 
FISH AND RAPINI
Four 6-ounce (170 g) 
sturgeon steaks
Grapeseed oil, for 
preparing the fish
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 pound (454 g) rapini or 
broccoli or similar, blanched in 
salted water, drained
1 lemon, for squeezing
1/4 cup (25 g) fresh bread 
crumbs, toastedPROCEDURE 
To make the anchovy butter: In a food processor, combine all the 
ingredients. Blend until combined. Reserve 4 tablespoons (56 g) 
and transfer the remainder to an airtight container. Refrigerate for 
up to 2 weeks. 
To make the fish and rapini: Start a fire in your grill with a 
combination of natural lump charcoal and chunks of hardwood 
and let it heat to roughly 500°F (250°C; see page 23). 
Brush the sturgeon steaks with grapeseed oil and season with 
salt and pepper. Place the steaks on the grill. Cook for 3 to 4 
minutes per side until just done. Set in a warm space near the grill 
to keep warm. 
In a large sauté pan or skillet over medium-high heat, combine 
the rapini with 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 ml) of water. Cook the 
rapini until it’s hot throughout and transfer to a plate, reserving  
11/2 tablespoons (23 ml) of the cooking water in the pan. Return 
the skillet to medium heat.
Add the reserved anchovy butter and let it gently melt, slowly 
whisking so the water and butter don’t separate. Place the rapini 
back into the pan and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt. 
Plate the sturgeon steaks on a plate and pour the rapini and 
butter sauce over them. Add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to 
the fish and sprinkle with the toasted bread crumbs to finish.

TextMUSKIE
A bit on eating muskies: Keeping and eating muskies can be a controversial subject. We caught the 
muskie used in these recipes on a Northern Wisconsin lake that, according to the head of the Depart -
ment of Natural Resources for that lake, has an exuberant muskie population that could be helped 
by removing a few now and then. This particular muskie also had what appeared to be a previously 
broken spine and some battle wounds—all of which deemed it a good fish to keep and eat. Beyond 
being in a heavily muskie-populated lake, the fish itself wasn’t as healthy as we usually see. Keeping 
this fish wasn’t taken lightly, and every bit was eaten. 
When keeping muskies, please check your local lake regulations and, with any fish, keep the 
overall fish population in mind. There are also considerations with young children, high-risk health 
populations, women of childbearing years, nursing mothers, and children younger than age 15—all 
should be cautious when eating apex predators (see page 19 for more information).
Wood-Fired 
Muskie Nuggets 
I haven’t eaten that much muskie, but this is a muskie recipe I have enjoyed the most. It came about 
when I was trying to figure out different ways to incorporate a smoke flavor into the meat without 
cooking it for an extended amount of time. The end result was muskie cooked over wood on a sharp -
ened juniper stick. It worked perfectly, as muskie responds well to a quick cook and also benefits from 
a solid smoke flavor. It’s finished with a bright shallot and oil sauce to give it back some moisture. 
Muskie, like northern pike, has a lot of Y bones to poke through during the butchering process. I 
use what I like to call a “five fillet” technique to make eating these fish easier (see page 36). For this 
recipe I used the top fillet, which dices into perfect squares that fit nicely on a stick. 
NOTE: You will need a stick for this recipe for roasting. Find one long enough to hold over a fire 
pit and clean about 10 inches (25 cm) off it to a small point.

TextPickled Muskie 
I love having pickled fish in the fridge. It’s such a delicious grab-and-go snack! This recipe takes me 
back to my days working with Chef Paul Berglund, when we’d often get in a ton of fresh herring and 
needed it to last for a week—what better way to preserve some than by pickling? This recipe works 
great with muskie or northerns as well. 
This pickle is a two-step process: The first is a mustard pickle to infuse a good amount of flavor 
into the fish and the second pickle cures the muskie while adding a heavy dose of acidity. The best 
part of this recipe is that it gets better every day that it sits in the second pickling liquid. Eat it on 
crackers, bread, or anything else crunchy you have in your cabinet. Add some Sugar-Cured Jala -
peños (page 61) for an extra kick. 
YIELD: Serves 8 to 12 as  
a snack 
INGREDIENTS FOR THE 
FIRST PICKLE
2 cups (480 g) Dijon mustard
1/2 cup (120 ml) apple 
cider vinegar
1 tablespoon (18 g) kosher salt
2 pounds (908 g) cleaned 
and skinned muskie, diced 
(medium size)
INGREDIENTS FOR THE 
SECOND PICKLE 
1 tablespoon (5 g) 
coriander seeds
4 allspice berries
4 juniper berries
1 medium red onion, diced
1 jalapeño pepper, diced
1/4 cup (50 g) sugar
2 tablespoons (30 g) 
Dijon mustard
2 cups (480 ml) water
2 cups (480 ml) apple 
cider vinegarPROCEDURE
For the first pickle: In a large plastic container, stir together the 
mustard, vinegar, and salt. Place the muskie into the mixture. 
Cover the container and refrigerate for 48 hours. 
For the second pickle: In a 10 x 10-inch (25 x 25 cm) piece 
of cheesecloth, combine the coriander, allspice berries, and 
juniper berries. Gather the cloth in a bundle and tie it closed with 
butcher’s twine. Place the filled cheesecloth and the rest of the 
ingredients into a 2-quart (1.9 L) saucepan and bring to a simmer 
over medium-high. Cook for 5 minutes. Transfer the pot to the 
refrigerator to cool, about 2 hours. 
Once cooled, place the cooled brine in a glass container. Strain 
the muskie from the first pickle and place it into the cooled brine 
for at least 24 hours, and up to 7 days. It is ready to be eaten after 
chilling for 24 hours in the pickling liquid.

TextMuskie and 
Mussels Stew 
This is another muskie recipe I’m really excited about, as it combines the essentials of a tomato fish 
stew with muskie and mussels. The unique blend of seafood gives the stew a full-bodied broth that’s 
hard to stop eating. It’s great on its own, but you can also pour it over toasted bread to soak up all 
the tomato and fish goodness in the broth.

(store-bought or smoked 
yourself; see tip)
1/3 cup (75 g) Homemade 
Aioli (page 86)
1/3 cup (75 g) crème fraîche 
1 tablespoon (15 g) stone-
ground mustard
4 Thai chiles, finely minced
3 celery stalks, minced
Handful minced fresh chives
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1 lemon, for squeezing
INGREDIENTS 
FOR THE BRINE
1 gallon (3.8 L) water
1 cup (300 g) kosher salt
1 cup (225 g) packed light 
brown sugar
4 garlic cloves, peeled
10 pounds (4.5 kg) skin-off 
whitefish filletsPROCEDURE
In a large bowl, flake apart the whitefish. Lightly fold in the 
remaining ingredients until fully incorporated. Taste and season 
with salt, pepper, and lemon juice until your desired flavor 
is achieved!
To brine the fish:  In a 6-quart (5.8 L) soup pot over high heat, 
combine the water, salt, brown sugar, and garlic. Bring to a boil. 
Pour the brine into a large plastic container (large enough to hold 
the fish and brine). Refrigerate to cool. Once cooled, place the 
fish in brine, cover the container, and refrigerate for 12 hours. 
To smoke the brined fish: Remove the fish from the brine and 
place it on a sheet pan. Refrigerate the fish, uncovered, for 
12 hours. 
Once the fish develops a sticky outside texture, preheat your 
smoker to 145°F (63°C). Put the fish onto the smoker’s grate and 
smoke for 2 hours until it reaches an internal temperature of 
145°F (63°C) measured with an instant-read thermometer. Remove 
from the smoker and refrigerate in an airtight container where it 
will keep for 5 days.
COOKING TIP 
If you purchase smoked whitefish, skip this. If you have white -
fish to smoke, here’s your guide! Whitefish, as do many meats, 
benefit from a 12- to 24-hour brine before smoking or cooking. 
After brining, let the fish dry, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 12 
hours so it forms a pellicle (thin skin) that smoke will adhere to 
more effectively. I prefer smoking with red oak, but cherry, apple, 
or hickory hardwoods all work. If you have a pellet smoker, that 
works well, too. This is a very basic brine; feel free to add herbs 
or spices as desired. photo on page 117

TextSmoked Whitefish 
and Wild Rice Pancakes 
I’ll take a savory pancake over a sweet one any day. They’re an underappreciated food in the world! 
This version includes smoked whitefish to give it extra oomph, and the wild rice adds some crunch. 
Instead of syrup, melt dollops of anchovy butter (page 132) over the pancakes and serve alongside 
eggs for a hearty breakfast. 
YIELD: Serves 4 to 6
INGREDIENTS
1 cup (165 g) cooked wild rice
8 ounces (225 g) smoked 
whitefish, flaked (store-
bought or smoked yourself, 
see page 140)
1/4 cup (25 g) finely chopped 
seeded jalapeño peppers 
1 cup (30 g) chopped 
fresh spinach
2 cups (248 g) all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
11/3 cups (320 ml) whole milk
2 large eggs, beaten
2 tablespoons (30 ml) 
grapeseed oil
Unsalted butter, for cookingPROCEDURE
In a large bowl, stir together the wild rice, whitefish, jalapeños, 
spinach, flour, baking powder, and salt
In another large bowl, combine the milk, beaten eggs, and 
grapeseed oil. Whisk to combine. Gently fold the wet ingredients 
into the dry ingredients, making sure not to overmix them. Form 
the batter into 6 to 8 individual patties and set aside. 
Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat and add a 
generous pat of butter to melt. Right before it starts to brown, 
working in batches and adding more butter as needed, add 
the patties to the skillet. Cook until browned on both sides 
and heated all the way through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Serve 
immediately.

TextSmoked Whitefish 
and Soft Eggs on Rye 
This recipe comes from another good friend of mine, Erik Sather. He’s a local celebrity chef in the 
Twin Cities and owns and operates one of the best butcher shops I’ve ever been to, Lowry Hill 
Meats. They do stuff the old-school way there, breaking down whole animals and guiding customers 
through how to cook the different cuts of meat. He also cooks an entire menu of food there and, if 
you stop by, you might see this on the menu! He gets his whitefish from Northern Waters Smokehaus, 
another classic Minnesota staple on the North Shore. 
YIELD: Serves 4
INGREDIENTS
6 tablespoons (84 g) 
unsalted butter
4 thick (1 inch, or 2.5 cm, or so) 
slices rye bread 
8 large eggs, beaten until 
smooth and pale yellow
8 ounces (225 g) smoked 
whitefish (store-bought or 
smoked yourself, see page 
140) lightly flaked apart, but 
still nice-sized pieces
4 ounces (115 g) Gruyère 
cheese, shaved into thin strips 
for melting
Sea salt
Fresh chives, for garnishing 
Freshly ground black pepperPROCEDURE
Place a large cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat. Using 
3 tablespoons (42 g) of butter, butter the rye bread. Working  
in batches if needed, place the bread in the hot skillet and toast 
on both sides until golden but still soft in the middle. Remove the 
bread from the skillet and set aside. 
Wipe the skillet clean with a paper towel, return it to medium 
heat, and add the remaining 3 tablespoons (42 g) of butter to 
melt, swirling the pan to coat it well. Pour in the eggs and let them 
sit for a moment. After about 90 seconds, while the eggs are 
slowly starting to cook but not brown, add the flaked fish and the 
shaved cheese. Lightly season with sea salt—the fish and cheese 
are already salty, so you just need to season the eggs. 
Once the eggs start to cook, give them a gentle folding stir 
(we’re not scrambling here) a couple times. Let them cook in the 
pan until mostly cooked, but still slightly runny, gently folding as 
needed. The residual heat of the cooked eggs will carry over and 
continue to cook the eggs on the plate. 
Cut the toast in half and place it on a plate. Fold the eggs and fish 
one last time and top the toast with the mixture. Garnish with the 
chives and season with more sea salt, as needed, and pepper.

TextGrilled Crawdads 
When I’m cooking, I often draw inspiration from what’s around me. For better or worse, one thing 
that’s typically near me is some sort of smoker or giant grill. This recipe for crawdads, which is ideal 
for a larger gathering, embraces the grill by cooking sausage and corn in a pan right in the grill, 
then throwing the crawdads in and shutting the grill. This recipe uses the same ingredients as the 
Steamed Crawdads (page 149), but the results couldn’t be more different. Everything here is covered 
in smoke and steam from the beer—stronger, more rustic flavors. 
Before cooking ’dads, make sure they’re properly cleaned. I use my (cleaned!) bathtub at home 
and rinse them in multiple batches of cold water until the water runs clean when they’re rinsed. It 
usually takes 4 to 5 rounds of water. 
YIELD: Serves 10 to 15
INGREDIENTS
Grapeseed oil, for cooking 
the kielbasa
2 pounds (908 g) kielbasa, cut 
into 1-inch (2.5 cm) chunks
10 pounds (4.5 kg) crawdads, 
cleaned (see headnote)
8 ears corn, shucked 
and halved 
2 pounds (908 g) small 
potatoes, boiled until soft
Two 12-ounce (360 ml) bottles 
pilsner beer
Old Bay seasoning, to tastePROCEDURE
Start a fire in your grill or smoker with a mix of lump charcoal and 
chunked hickory and get it wicked hot, to about 450°F (230°C; 
see page 23). 
Heat a giant cast-iron skillet or paella pan on the grill and add 
a thin layer of grapeseed oil. Add the kielbasa. Sear the chunks 
until they have a solid brown color, 6 to 7 minutes total. Remove 
the sausages and drain the skillet of most of its fat, leaving just 
enough to coat the bottom. 
In an extra-large bowl, stir together the seared sausage, 
crawdads, corn, and boiled potatoes. Place the mix back into the 
skillet and return it to the grill. Pour 1 bottle of beer into the skillet. 
Cover the grill and shut the top holes to about 50 percent. Let the 
mix steam and smoke for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the crawdads 
are cooked through and have reached an internal temperature 
of 165°F (74°C) measured with an instant-read thermometer, 
stirring the mixture once or twice to make sure everything is 
cooking evenly. Add more beer, if needed, to create more steam. 
Once cooked, remove the skillet and pour everything onto a 
paper-lined heatproof table. Aggressively season with Old Bay 
and dig in!

TextSteamed Crawdads 
This recipe stems from the way I like to cook crabs, which is a simple steaming. Y ou’ll find this is a 
clean-tasting, delicious meal that can please a huge crowd. As mentioned in the Grilled Crawdad rec -
ipe (page 146), it’s important to clean your crawdads thoroughly before cooking them. That’s doubly 
important in this recipe, where there’s no smoke flavor to hide behind. To cook this just right, you’ll 
need a large stockpot with a perforated insert that fits into the pot and sits off the bottom by about 
1/2 inch (1 cm) or so. 
YIELD: Serves 10 to 15
INGREDIENTS
Two 12-ounce (360 ml) bottles 
pilsner beer
10 pounds (4.5 kg) smoked 
crawdads (store-bought 
or smoked yourself, see 
page 146) 
8 ears corn, shucked 
and halved
2 pounds (908 g) small 
potatoes, boiled until soft
2 pounds (908 g) kielbasa, cut 
into 1-inch (2.5 cm) chunks
Old Bay seasoning, to tastePROCEDURE
In a 16-quart (15 L) stockpot over high heat, warm the beer. 
In an extra-large bowl, combine the crawdads, corn, potatoes, 
and kielbasa. Transfer to the stockpot’s insert. Place the insert 
into the pot and cover the pot. Turn the heat to medium. Let 
steam for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the crawdads are fully cooked 
and have reached an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C) 
measured with an instant-read thermometer. Remove the insert 
and pour the contents over a paper-lined heatproof table. Season 
liberally with Old Bay and enjoy!

TextCrawdad Bisque 
Bisque, like chowder, is the ultimate comfort food on a cold, rainy day. It’s incredibly full-flavored, fill -
ing, and smells wonderful while it cooks. Make your own stock for this recipe—it’s the game changer. 
As always, make sure your crawdads are clean and free of any dirt (see page 146) before you begin. 
YIELD: Serves 6 to 8 as an 
appetizer 
INGREDIENTS 
3 pounds (1.36 kg) 
crawdads, cleaned
1 tablespoon (14 g) 
unsalted butter
2 celery stalks, 
roughly chopped
1 large carrot, roughly chopped
1 large yellow onion, 
roughly chopped
1 fennel bulb, cored and 
roughly chopped
1 head garlic, cloves separated 
and peeled
1 tablespoon (5 g) 
coriander seeds
1 cup (240 ml) sweet sherry
2 tablespoons (32 g) 
tomato paste 
1/2 cup (95 g) long-grain rice
1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy cream
Fresh parsley, for garnishingPROCEDURE
Fill a 6-quart (5.8 L) pot with water and bring it to a boil over 
high heat. Place the crawdads in the water and simmer for 4 to 
5 minutes, or until they have fully cooked and reach an internal 
temperature of 165°F (74°C) measured with an instant-read 
thermometer. Using a slotted spoon, remove the crawdads from 
the water and set aside. When cool enough to handle, remove 
the meat from the tails and set aside. Using a cleaver, roughly 
chop the remaining shells. 
In a 4-quart (3.8 L) saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. 
Add the celery, carrot, onion, fennel, garlic, coriander seeds, and 
chopped shells. Sauté for 5 minutes. Add the sherry. Cook until 
reduced to just 1 tablespoon (15 ml), 5 to 6 minutes. 
Stir in the tomato paste. Sauté for another minute to toast it 
slightly. Add enough water to cover everything by 2 inches 
(5 cm). Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook, mostly covered, 
for 2 hours without stirring. 
Pass the stock through a fine-mesh strainer into a large heatproof 
bowl, pushing all the extra liquid through using the back of a ladle 
(that’s the good stuff). Return the strained stock to the pot and 
bring it back to a simmer over medium heat. 
Add the rice. Cook for 30 minutes, or until it’s cooked through. 
Using an immersion blender, blend the mixture until smooth. Stir 
in the heavy cream and adjust for consistency, if needed (if too 
thick, thin with a bit of water; if too thin, let it reduce further). 
In each bowl, place a pile of the crawdad tail meat and ladle the 
soup over it. Garnish with parsley and serve.

TextBasic Fish Stock
Fish stock is a great way to use up your carcasses and bones. Fish stock can be used in most fish 
recipes instead of water or chicken stock and in many soups and sauces. Like any stock, it’s great to 
have a batch in the freezer for quick use. 
YIELD: Makes 4 quarts (4 L)
INGREDIENTS
2 pounds (908 g) fish bones or 
carcasses, rinsed of any muck
2 celery stalks, sliced
1 large white onion, peeled and 
cut into 8 wedges
1 large leek, cleaned and sliced
4 thyme sprigs
1 bay leaf
1 tablespoon (9 g) peppercorns
1 tablespoon (5 g) 
coriander seeds
1/4 cup (60 ml) dry white winePROCEDURE
In a large stockpot, combine all the ingredients and add enough 
water to cover by 2 inches (5 cm). Slowly bring the ingredients to 
a simmer. Simmer for 1 hour. Skim off any scum from the top that 
appears during cooking. 
Line a colander with cheesecloth and place it over a large bowl. 
When the stock is done, ladle scoops of the broth through the 
cheesecloth to remove any impurities. Leave the bottom 1 inch 
(2.5 cm) of stock in the pot because it’s often murky. Cool the 
stock and use as necessary. 
Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 5 days or freeze for 
up to one year.
